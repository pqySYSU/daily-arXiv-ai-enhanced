*Pu Li,Wenhao Zhang,Weize Quan,Biao Zhang,Peter Wonka,Dong-Ming Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrepGPT is a single-stage autoregressive framework for CAD boundary representation generation using Voronoi Half-Patch representation and dual VQ-VAEs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and versatile applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing B-rep generative methods rely on cascaded multi-stage networks due to the intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements, leading to error accumulation and computational inefficiency.

Method: Proposes Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation that decomposes B-reps into unified local units, uses dual VQ-VAEs to encode vertex topology and VHPs into tokens, and trains a decoder-only Transformer for autoregressive token prediction.

Result: BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation and demonstrates versatility in conditional generation from various inputs (labels, point clouds, text, images) as well as autocompletion and interpolation tasks.

Conclusion: The single-stage autoregressive framework with VHP representation successfully addresses the limitations of multi-stage approaches, providing efficient and high-quality B-rep generation with broad application potential.

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

### [2] [Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Wilson Fearn,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Saddle-Free Guidance (SFG) is a new method that uses positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions to guide score-based generative models without requiring labeled data or additional model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Auto-Guidance require labeled data or training additional models, making them challenging to use when labeled training data is unavailable or training new models is not feasible.

Method: SFG maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. It leverages the discovery that positive curvature in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models.

Result: SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When combined with Auto-Guidance, it achieves general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. SFG also boosts diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity in FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 experiments.

Conclusion: SFG provides an effective guidance method for score-based models that doesn't require labeled data or additional training, has the same computational cost as CFG, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models.

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

### [3] [FACT-GS: Frequency-Aligned Complexity-Aware Texture Reparameterization for 2D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23292)
*Tianhao Xie,Linlian Jiang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Tiberiu Popa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACT-GS introduces a frequency-aligned texture allocation method for Gaussian Splatting that adaptively allocates texture sampling density based on local visual complexity, improving detail preservation while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current texture-based Gaussian Splatting methods use uniform sampling grids that inefficiently allocate texture space, causing high-frequency regions to be under-sampled (blurred details) while smooth regions waste capacity.

Method: FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem using a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy. It replaces uniform textures with a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density, performing non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids.

Result: The method recovers sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget while preserving real-time performance, improving texture space utilization by aligning sampling density with local visual frequency.

Conclusion: FACT-GS provides an effective solution to inefficient texture allocation in Gaussian Splatting by adaptively distributing sampling density according to visual complexity, enhancing detail preservation without sacrificing real-time rendering capabilities.

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

### [4] [UniArt: Unified 3D Representation for Generating 3D Articulated Objects with Open-Set Articulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21887)
*Bu Jin,Weize Li,Songen Gu,Yupeng Zheng,Yuhang Zheng,Zhengyi Zhou,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from single images, using a unified latent representation for geometry, texture, segmentation, and kinematics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of articulated 3D objects is costly and difficult to scale, limiting realistic simulation and robotics applications. Existing methods are multi-stage and lack unified representation.

Method: UniArt uses a diffusion-based framework with unified latent representation encoding geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. It introduces reversible joint-to-voxel embedding for spatial alignment of articulation features with volumetric geometry, and formulates articulation type prediction as an open-set problem for generalization to novel joints.

Result: Experiments on PartNet-Mobility benchmark show state-of-the-art performance in mesh quality and articulation accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness in generating articulated 3D objects from single images.

Conclusion: UniArt provides an end-to-end solution for articulated 3D object synthesis from single images, overcoming limitations of manual creation and multi-stage approaches while enabling generalization to novel articulation types.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [5] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning is a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates Whole Slide Images through reasoning and self-reflection to find diagnostically relevant regions without dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are gigapixel images crucial for cancer diagnosis but extremely large (over 10 billion pixels), making manual navigation challenging and time-consuming for clinical inspection.

Method: PathReasoning mimics pathologists' navigation by starting with random candidate regions, then iteratively reviews selections with self-reflection, reasons over visual-clinical correspondence, and proposes new regions to explore, building a reasoning chain across multiple rounds.

Result: PathReasoning outperforms strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks, and improves report generation accuracy by 10% compared to GPT-4o on breast cancer.

Conclusion: PathReasoning enables efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability by prioritizing question-specific regions and constructing interpretable reasoning chains in digital pathology.

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal prototyping framework that integrates whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing heterogeneity and missing data issues through biological prototyping, multiview alignment, bipartite fusion, and semantic genomics imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal integration of histology and genomics has strong potential for precision oncology, but phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits intra-modal representation quality and inter-modal integration. Existing methods often overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially or entirely missing.

Method: Four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information; 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent superiority compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed flexible multimodal prototyping framework effectively integrates whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology, addressing key challenges of heterogeneity and missing data in real-world clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

### [7] [AmodalGen3D: Generative Amodal 3D Object Reconstruction from Sparse Unposed Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21945)
*Junwei Zhou,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D is a generative framework for complete 3D object reconstruction from sparse, occluded views, using amodal completion priors and multi-view geometry to infer unseen parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-view or inpainting approaches fail with sparse, unposed, partially occluded views, producing incomplete or inconsistent 3D reconstructions. Real-world scenarios often have object surfaces never directly observed due to occlusion.

Method: Integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning. Uses View-Wise Cross Attention for sparse-view feature fusion and Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention for unobserved structure inference. Jointly models visible and hidden regions.

Result: Superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Faithfully reconstructs 3D objects consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts.

Conclusion: AmodalGen3D addresses the pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications by enabling complete reconstruction from sparse, occluded views.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

### [8] [TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21946)
*Finlay G. C. Hudson,James A. D. Gardner,William A. P. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPVid-360 introduces a novel task for predicting 3D directions to queried scene points across video sequences, even when points are outside the camera's field of view, enabling allocentric scene understanding without 4D ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision systems lack persistent, panoramic understanding and struggle with object permanence beyond visible regions, particularly in TAP tasks where points outside the field of view cannot be tracked. Humans maintain mental models of surroundings, while AI systems process scenes egocentrically frame-by-frame.

Method: Uses 360 videos as supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across full panoramas using a 2D pipeline. Adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates.

Result: Introduces TAPVid360-10k dataset with 10k perspective videos and ground truth directional point tracking. Baseline method outperforms existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

Conclusion: TAPVid-360 enables learning allocentric scene representations without dynamic 4D ground truth, addressing limitations in panoramic understanding and object permanence in current vision systems.

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

### [9] [WalkCLIP: Multimodal Learning for Urban Walkability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21947)
*Shilong Xiang,JangHyeon Lee,Min Namgung,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP is a multimodal AI framework that integrates satellite imagery, street view imagery, and population dynamics data to predict urban walkability, outperforming single-source approaches by capturing both visual and behavioral dimensions of walking environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional walkability assessments are costly and difficult to scale. Existing single-source approaches (satellite imagery, street view, population data) each capture only one dimension of the walking environment, lacking comprehensive understanding needed for accurate walkability prediction.

Method: WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines them with a spatial aggregation module for neighborhood context, and fuses these features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model.

Result: Evaluated at 4,660 locations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment, demonstrating superior performance in walkability prediction.

Conclusion: Integrating complementary visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of walking environments, showing that multimodal approaches are more effective than single-source methods for urban walkability assessment.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

*Guying Lin,Kemeng Huang,Michael Liu,Ruihan Gao,Hanke Chen,Lyuhao Chen,Beijia Lu,Taku Komura,Yuan Liu,Jun-Yan Zhu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAT3D is the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics simulation to create physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D scene generation methods often produce physically implausible scenes with object intersections and unstable arrangements, lacking the physical realism needed for downstream applications like robotic manipulation and scene editing.

Method: PAT3D generates 3D objects from text prompts, infers spatial relations, organizes them into hierarchical scene trees, then uses a differentiable rigid-body simulator to achieve static equilibrium under gravity. It includes simulation-in-the-loop optimization to ensure physical stability, non-intersection, and semantic consistency.

Result: PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. It uniquely produces simulation-ready 3D scenes suitable for downstream tasks like scene editing and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: PAT3D represents a significant advancement in text-to-3D scene generation by integrating physics simulation, enabling physically plausible, simulation-ready scenes that overcome limitations of previous methods and open new possibilities for practical applications.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

### [12] [DialBench: Towards Accurate Reading Recognition of Pointer Meter using Large Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21982)
*Futian Wang,Chaoliu Weng,Xiao Wang,Zhen Chen,Zhicheng Zhao,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new large-scale dataset (RPM-10K) and vision-language model (MRLM) for robust pointer meter reading recognition, addressing challenges like reflections, occlusions, and dynamic viewing angles through physical relation injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pointer meter reading approaches are fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and thin pointer-scale interactions. The field lacks large-scale datasets to support robust algorithm development.

Method: Proposes MRLM (vision-language model) based on physical relation injection that explicitly encodes geometric and causal relationships between pointer and scale. Uses cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection to align perception with physical reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on the newly created RPM-10K dataset containing 10,730 meter images that reflect real-world challenges.

Conclusion: The paper addresses key challenges in pointer meter reading by introducing both a large-scale benchmark dataset and a novel vision-language model that incorporates physical reasoning, advancing robust meter reading recognition for smart power systems.

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

### [13] [PPBoost: Progressive Prompt Boosting for Text-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21984)
*Xuchen Li,Hengrui Gu,Mohan Zhang,Qin Liu,Zhen Tan,Xinyuan Zhu,Huixue Zhou,Tianlong Chen,Kaixiong Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPBoost transforms weak text prompts into strong visual bounding boxes for zero-shot medical image segmentation, outperforming text/visual-prompted baselines without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-prompted models lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift, while visual-prompted models require costly precise bounding boxes that are hard to obtain in clinical practice.

Method: PPBoost uses vision-language models to generate initial pseudo-bboxes from text, filters unreliable predictions, trains a pseudo-labeled detector, and refines bboxes during inference to guide segmentation models.

Result: PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance across three diverse datasets, surpassing text/visual-prompted baselines and even few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data.

Conclusion: PPBoost effectively bridges the gap between text and visual prompting by transforming weak text cues into strong spatial guidance, enabling zero-shot medical image segmentation with improved performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

Motivation: Current multi-modal LLMs lack real-time interactive guidance capabilities needed for future AI assistants. They struggle with live step-by-step coaching, detecting successful instruction execution, identifying user mistakes, and providing timely feedback - all requiring asynchronous video stream processing rather than turn-based interactions.

Method: Created Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark/dataset from CaptainCook4D with user mistakes during task execution. Features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages with precise timestamping of mistake alerts. Developed LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM specifically designed for interactive instructional guidance.

Result: The work provides the first dedicated benchmark for live situated coaching and introduces LiveMamba as a strong baseline model. Evaluated state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the new benchmark, demonstrating the need for specialized models for real-time interactive guidance.

Conclusion: This research establishes foundational tools for developing and evaluating AI systems capable of live interactive coaching, addressing critical gaps in current multi-modal LLMs for real-time task guidance with mistake detection and correction.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

*Sen Fang,Hongbin Zhong,Yalin Feng,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive acceleration pipeline for Rectified Flow models that achieves 611% speedup for 512x512 image generation, far surpassing existing methods that typically achieve only 18% acceleration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow and Flow Matching models have improved generative model performance but existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied due to theoretical and design differences from diffusion models, creating a need for specialized acceleration techniques.

Method: The authors implement an overall acceleration pipeline including: 1) batch processing with a new velocity field, 2) vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and 3) dynamic TensorRT compilation specifically designed for flow-based models.

Result: The new method accelerates 512x512 image generation speed by up to 611%, significantly outperforming existing public methods that typically achieve only 18% acceleration.

Conclusion: The proposed comprehensive acceleration pipeline successfully addresses the unique challenges of Rectified Flow models and achieves substantial speed improvements that far exceed current non-generalized acceleration methods.

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Shen Chen,Yijun Wang,Jianxin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedEyes is a reinforcement learning framework that models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to medical image regions, using expert gaze guidance and dual-mode exploration to improve medical VQA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models using chain-of-thought reasoning via RLVR tend to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths due to purely on-policy learning, lacking the progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning observed in clinical workflows.

Method: MedEyes incorporates off-policy expert guidance by converting expert visual search trajectories into structured behavioral signals. It uses Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) with dual-mode exploration (scanning for abnormality localization and drilling for regional analysis), Confidence Value Sampler (CVS) with nucleus sampling and adaptive termination, and dual-stream GRPO optimization to decouple on-policy and off-policy learning signals.

Result: MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: MedEyes successfully models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by incorporating expert visual guidance and dual-mode exploration, showing potential for building interpretable medical AI systems that better emulate clinical diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

Motivation: VLMs like CLIP have strong open vocabulary classification but assign high confidence to misclassifications, limiting reliability in safety-critical applications.

Method: Training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation using visual feature consistency within classes via feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings.

Result: State-of-the-art error detection performance on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD, significantly outperforming deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Conclusion: The method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

*Joel Alberto Santos,Zongwei Wu,Xavier Alameda-Pineda,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Direct audio-visual object grounding without text transcription is feasible and sometimes outperforms text-based methods, especially for robustness to linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object grounding methods rely on text transcription as an intermediate step, which may be inefficient and not robust to linguistic variability. The paper questions whether direct audio-visual alignment without text is possible.

Method: Simplified task to single-word spoken instructions, created new audio-based grounding dataset with diverse objects and accents, adapted and benchmarked several audio-visual models from related fields.

Result: Direct grounding from audio is feasible and in some cases outperforms transcription-based methods, particularly in robustness to linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Direct audio grounding is a promising approach that encourages renewed interest in this direction and paves the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

TL;DR: Simple UDA method adapts image styles in frequency domain to reduce domain discrepancy, using lightweight pre-processing during training only, achieving strong performance on domain-adaptive object detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most state-of-the-art UDA methods are overly complex, relying on adversarial training or elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models. There's a need for simpler, more practical approaches that maintain effectiveness while reducing computational overhead.

Method: Proposes unsupervised domain adaptation method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain. Introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training that is entirely discarded at inference time, incurring no additional computational overhead.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks for domain-adaptive object detection tasks, where source domains have accessible annotations but target domains (adverse weather/low-light scenes) are challenging.

Conclusion: The method offers a simple yet effective UDA approach that reduces domain discrepancy through frequency-domain style adaptation, providing practical benefits with no inference overhead while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

*Jiayuan Du,Yiming Zhao,Zhenglong Guo,Yong Pan,Wenbo Hou,Zhihui Hao,Kun Zhan,Qijun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel transformer-based architecture for trajectory-conditioned 3D scene occupancy forecasting that predicts multi-frame future occupancy end-to-end from raw image features, avoiding discrete tokenization and BEV limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using VAEs for discrete occupancy tokens limit representational capacity, and BEV projections impose structural constraints. The paper aims to overcome these limitations for more effective spatiotemporal dependency capture.

Method: Uses attention-based transformer architecture with sparse occupancy representation that bypasses intermediate BEV projection. Predicts multi-frame future occupancy directly from raw image features in end-to-end manner, avoiding discrete tokenization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by significant margin. Demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding with high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies without the limitations of discrete tokenization or BEV representations, enabling superior trajectory-conditioned 3D scene occupancy forecasting.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

### [21] [ICM-SR: Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization for Image Super-Resoultion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22048)
*Junoh Kang,Donghun Ryu,Bohyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM proposes image-conditioned manifold regularization using sparse structural information (colormap + Canny edges) instead of text conditioning for better real-world image super-resolution alignment and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Real-ISR methods use text-conditioned diffusion model manifolds, which are conceptually misaligned with the task (should generate HQ images directly tied to LQ inputs) and practically flawed (produce color distortions and blurred edges). Dense image conditioning is unstable due to high information density.

Method: Image-Conditioned Manifold Regularization (ICM) regularizes outputs toward a manifold conditioned on sparse structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. This provides task-aligned, stable regularization without the instability of dense conditioning.

Result: Experiments confirm ICM significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating effectiveness for real-world applications.

Conclusion: ICM offers a more suitable regularization approach for Real-ISR by using sparse image structural information instead of text conditioning, achieving better alignment with the task and improved super-resolution quality.

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPCNet introduces triple physical constraints based on Kubelka-Munk theory to address specular reflection limitations in Retinex-based low-light enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance without new parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Retinex-based low-light enhancement methods ignore specular reflection and construct physical constraints in image space, limiting model generalization and performance.

Method: Proposes TPCNet with triple physical constraints based on Kubelka-Munk theory, preserving specular reflection coefficient and reformulating constraints in feature space rather than image space.

Result: TPCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets, improving both quantitative metrics and visual quality without introducing additional parameters.

Conclusion: The triple physical constraints effectively address specular reflection limitations in Retinex theory, enhancing low-light image enhancement performance through better physical modeling in feature space.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online handwriting generation methods fail to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting real-world applications where models need to handle new writers and characters not seen during training.

Method: Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA) with adaptive style branch learning stroke attributes (direction, spacing, placement, flow) and adaptive content branch decomposing characters into structural information (via local encoder) and texture details (via global encoder) for generalization to unseen characters.

Result: Extensive experiments show DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance for unseen online handwriting generation setting.

Conclusion: DNA model effectively addresses the challenge of generating handwriting for unseen writers and characters, making online handwriting generation more applicable to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Current video diffusion models lack seamless translation between different perspectives (first-person vs third-person), which is crucial for applications in filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models.

Method: WorldWander uses in-context learning with video diffusion transformers, integrating In-Context Perspective Alignment and Collaborative Position Encoding to model cross-view synchronization. It's trained on EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset of synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets.

Result: WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between egocentric and exocentric video perspectives, advancing video generation capabilities for cross-view applications.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for brain age estimation often fail to capture continuous neuromorphological changes, leading to suboptimal feature representation. Brain age estimation could serve as a biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss for brain age estimation from T1w structural MRI. Leverages ResNet backbone and Grad-RAM for visual explanation of regression results.

Result: Achieves MAE of 4.27 years and R² of 0.93 with limited training data, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with same backbone. Performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods with much larger datasets. Grad-RAM reveals more nuanced age-related features.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively captures continuous brain aging patterns and shows potential as a clinical biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders, with demonstrated correlation between brain age gap and disease severity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients.

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multi-modal fusion methods use single dense networks that struggle with significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance in 3D understanding tasks.

Method: MoE3D integrates Mixture of Experts with specialized expert networks for specific modalities/cross-modal interactions, uses MoE-based transformer for complementary visual information, information aggregation module, Top-1 gating for efficiency, and progressive pre-training strategy leveraging semantic and 2D priors.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks, surpassing top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer benchmark.

Conclusion: MoE3D effectively addresses multi-modal heterogeneity in 3D understanding through specialized expert networks and progressive pre-training, demonstrating superior performance over existing fusion methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperST is a framework that predicts gene expression from histology images using hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships in spatial transcriptomics data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tissue datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting gene expression from histology images focus only on spot-level matching and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of spatial transcriptomics data. There's also an information asymmetry problem where gene expression contains molecular details that may lack visual correlates in images, requiring better representation learning to bridge this modality gap.

Method: HyperST uses hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships. It includes: 1) Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from both modalities, and 2) a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module that unifies these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings to enrich image representations with molecular semantics.

Result: HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, demonstrating superior cross-modal prediction capabilities compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The HyperST framework successfully bridges the modality gap between histology images and gene expression by modeling hierarchical relationships in hyperbolic space, enabling more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction from cost-effective histology images.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

### [29] [PROMPTMINER: Black-Box Prompt Stealing against Text-to-Image Generative Models via Reinforcement Learning and Fuzz Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22119)
*Mingzhe Li,Renhao Zhang,Zhiyang Wen,Siqi Pan,Bruno Castro da Silva,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMPTMINER is a black-box framework for prompt stealing attacks that recovers text prompts from generated images using RL optimization for subjects and fuzzing search for stylistic modifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality prompts for text-to-image models have become valuable digital assets, but their rising value exposes them to security and IP risks through prompt stealing attacks. Existing approaches have limitations: they require white-box access, large labeled datasets, or rely on captioning without optimization, making them impractical and non-adaptive.

Method: PROMPTMINER uses a two-phase black-box approach: (1) Reinforcement learning-based optimization to reconstruct the primary subject from the image, and (2) Fuzzing-driven search to recover stylistic modifiers. This decoupled approach avoids needing gradient access or large supervised datasets.

Result: The framework achieves CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. It maintains strong performance on in-the-wild images (7.5% improvement in CLIP similarity) and shows robustness under defensive perturbations.

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER provides an effective black-box solution for prompt stealing that addresses limitations of existing methods, demonstrating superior performance, better generalization to unknown generators, and strong robustness against defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

TL;DR: GoPrune: An accelerated structured pruning method using ℓ₂,ₚ-norm with p∈[0,1) and proximal alternating minimization for efficient CNN compression on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as depth grows, hindering deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Existing ℓₚ-norm pruning methods only consider unstructured pruning with p∈(0,1) and have low computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes GoPrune method using ℓ₂,ₚ-norm for sparse network learning with p extended to [0,1). Develops efficient optimization algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization (PAM) where subproblems have closed-form solutions, improving compression efficiency.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate superior performance in network pruning compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: GoPrune provides an effective accelerated structured pruning method for CNN compression, enabling better deployment on edge devices through improved computational efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning.

*Xiang Li,Zirui Wang,Zixuan Huang,James M. Rehg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cue3D is a framework for quantifying which image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, etc.) modern 3D generation models actually use, revealing that geometric cues like shading are more important than texture for generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent deep generative models have advanced single-image 3D generation, it's unclear which traditional monocular cues (shading, texture, silhouette, etc.) these methods actually exploit. There's a need to understand what visual information modern 3D networks rely on.

Method: Cue3D systematically perturbs individual image cues (shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, local continuity) and measures their impact on 3D output quality across seven state-of-the-art methods spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms.

Result: The analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness (not texture) dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. Models show over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues like perspective and local continuity across different model families.

Conclusion: Cue3D advances understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models by identifying key dependencies and sensitivities.

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework that improves generalization in video tasks by preventing semantic space narrowing through competitive prompting and generic attribute anchors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on video tasks impairs generalization to unseen classes due to forgetting effects. Existing methods that regularize hand-crafted vs soft prompts weaken learning ability. Need to mitigate semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning while maintaining generalization.

Method: Proposes coupling prompt learning with externally supervised prompts. For textual prompts: uses pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard tokens concatenated with soft tokens via learnable mapping layer (competitive prompting). Also introduces irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain pre-trained semantic space relevance.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction in video tasks.

Conclusion: The coupling prompt learning framework effectively prevents semantic space overfitting to supervised categories and preserves generalization ability by introducing external supervision and maintaining generic attribute relevance.

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIN (Virtual Inking Network) is an AI system that autonomously identifies surgical resection margins on whole-slide pathology images using cautery-related histomorphology, reducing reliance on physical inks and standardizing margin assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology practice uses physical inking for margin assessment, but this is applied variably and cautery artifacts can obscure true margins on histological sections, creating standardization issues and potential impact on patient outcomes.

Method: VIN uses a frozen foundation model as feature extractor with a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. Trained on 120 H&E slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks (~2TB data) with pathologist annotations.

Result: In blind testing on 20 unseen slides, VIN produced coherent margin overlays qualitatively aligned with expert annotations. Quantitative region-level accuracy was ~73.3%, with errors confined to limited areas not disrupting whole-slide margin map continuity.

Conclusion: VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and provides reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into digital pathology workflows and downstream margin distance measurements.

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

TL;DR: DualVLA addresses action degeneration in Vision-Language-Action models by using dual-layer data pruning and dual-teacher adaptive distillation to preserve both reasoning capabilities and action performance, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models suffer from action degeneration when fine-tuned with multimodal data - they lose manipulation skills gained from robot demonstrations while trying to restore broader reasoning capabilities.

Method: 1) Dual-layer data pruning to remove redundant embodied reasoning data that interferes with action learning; 2) Dual-teacher adaptive distillation that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability.

Result: DualVLA achieves 61.0% average success rate in SimplerEnv and 65.4 average score across eight multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating superior balance between action execution and multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed DualVLA framework successfully addresses the action degeneration problem in VLAs through careful data curation and adaptive distillation, enabling models to maintain both precise manipulation skills and strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based sign language generation systems focus on semantic accuracy but overlook emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness for the Deaf community.

Method: Proposes EASL with emotion-semantic disentanglement modules using progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features, then uses emotional representations to guide semantic interaction during pose decoding with 7-class emotion confidence scores.

Result: EASL achieves superior pose accuracy compared to all baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Conclusion: The proposed emotion-aware architecture successfully addresses the emotional expressiveness gap in sign language generation, enabling more natural and expressive communication for the Deaf community.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-based perception models for autonomous driving are mostly trained on clear weather data and cannot adapt to various weather changes. Existing weather-specific models prioritize weather removal but lack adaptability to diverse conditions.

Method: Proposes a semantic-enabled network with Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and Detection Unit (DTU). PPU uses a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images. DTU integrates semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network.

Result: Achieves 1.47% to 8.80% improvement in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather conditions.

Conclusion: Semantics enable plausible content generation for missing areas, understanding of object boundaries, and preservation of visual coherency, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance in all weather conditions.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A stacked ensemble model using fine-tuned CNNs (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) with CatBoost meta-learner achieves 73% accuracy for multiclass KL grading and 87.5% for binary KOA detection, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) severity assessment using X-ray images and Kellgren-Lawrence grading is time-consuming, requires expertise, and suffers from subjective interpretation leading to diagnostic inaccuracies. There's a need for automated, objective classification systems.

Method: Developed a stacked ensemble model with fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks as base learners (MobileNetV2, YOLOv8, DenseNet201) and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner for two classification tasks: binary KOA detection and multiclass KL grading.

Result: The model achieved 73% balanced test accuracy for multiclass KL grading (5 levels) and 87.5% balanced test accuracy for binary KOA detection, outperforming previous works in the literature.

Conclusion: The stacked ensemble approach provides an effective automated solution for KOA severity assessment, reducing subjectivity and expertise requirements while achieving higher accuracy than existing methods.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Conclusion: RemedyGS represents the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework against computation cost attacks on 3D Gaussian splatting systems, enabling reliable deployment of 3DGS applications and services.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing talking face generation methods rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift during cross-identity reenactment.

Method: Uses cross-attention mechanism to implicitly model motion discrepancy and identity alignment in a unified latent space, replaces traditional flow-based warping. Includes identity-adaptive module for projecting motion latents into personalized spaces, and lightweight flow-matching motion generator for producing implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues.

Result: Surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization. Achieves state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency: 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on RTX 4090 GPU.

Conclusion: IMTalker demonstrates that implicit motion transfer with cross-attention is more effective than traditional flow-based approaches for talking face generation, enabling robust global motion rendering while preserving speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

TL;DR: This paper introduces GRPO (Group-Relative Policy Optimization) to improve long-term PM concentration forecasting in East Asia, addressing operational cost asymmetry and reducing false alarms by 47.3% while maintaining competitive F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models for PM forecasting lack region-specific dynamics and real-time capabilities for East Asia's complex terrain. Standard point-wise objectives fail to account for asymmetric operational costs where false alarms erode public trust while missed severe events endanger populations.

Method: The authors created the CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia and developed GRPO with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities, addressing the cost mismatch in forecasting.

Result: The approach reduces regional error by 59.5% and false alarm rate by 47.3% compared to SFT-only baselines while achieving competitive F1-scores, enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts for public health alerts.

Conclusion: GRPO significantly improves forecast reliability for practical air quality warning systems by better aligning predictions with operational priorities, making it effective for real-world applications in complex regions like East Asia.

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS-CBM is a Partially Shared Concept Bottleneck Model that improves interpretability by addressing visual grounding, concept redundancy, and balancing accuracy with concept compactness through multimodal concept generation, shared concept strategy, and a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) using LLMs/VLMs for automated concept generation face three key challenges: poor visual grounding (concepts not well-aligned with visual features), concept redundancy (overlapping concepts), and lack of metrics to balance predictive accuracy with concept compactness.

Method: PS-CBM introduces three core components: (1) multimodal concept generator integrating LLM semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA) metric that jointly captures predictive accuracy and concept compactness.

Result: Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts.

Conclusion: PS-CBM effectively addresses fundamental limitations of existing CBMs, achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability through better visual grounding, reduced concept redundancy, and principled balancing of accuracy with concept compactness.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

*Zhaoyang Wei,Wenchao Ding,Yanchao Hao,Xi Chen*

TL;DR: GRiP is a two-stage training framework that combines guided perception and reasoning to improve visual grounded reasoning in multimodal AI, achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for visual reasoning are trapped between unstable end-to-end RL and rigid supervised fine-tuning, leading to models that either struggle to learn or lack cognitive flexibility for complex real-world scenes.

Method: GRiP uses a two-stage training framework with cognitive-enhanced RL featuring: 1) Salience-Weighted IoU Reward to prioritize mission-critical object localization, and 2) Multi-Heuristic Reward to encourage diverse yet valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on challenging benchmarks TreeBench and V* Bench, demonstrating significant performance gains in complex visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence, moving beyond simplistic rewards.

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

*Adnan Ferdous Ashrafi,Hasanul Kabir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Graph Convolutional Network model using Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks achieves 74.82% accuracy and 0.82 AUC for ASD diagnosis from multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with varied symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely challenging. Current diagnostic approaches lack objectivity and reliability, necessitating more accurate computational methods.

Method: The paper proposes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for ASD classification. Using the ABIDE I dataset (870 patients), the model employs a multi-branch architecture that processes resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and phenotypic data separately before concatenation. A population graph is constructed using site-based similarity to encode relationships between individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters enable localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, while GAT layers enhance node representations through attention-weighted aggregation of neighboring information. The model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with 5,206 features per individual.

Result: The proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 74.82% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire ABIDE I dataset. This performance surpasses multiple state-of-the-art baselines including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Conclusion: The GCN model with Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks demonstrates superior performance for ASD diagnosis using multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. The approach effectively captures complex relationships between individuals through population graph construction and attention mechanisms, providing a promising framework for objective and accurate neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

*Maitrayee Keskar,Mohan Trivedi,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTR-VP is a vision-based trajectory planning method that replaces map features with learned visual representations from images, using a ViT encoder and cross-attention with intent embeddings, evaluated on Waymo dataset showing multi-future prediction improves planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a trajectory planning method for autonomous driving that uses image-based context embeddings instead of traditional map-based features, aligning with motion prediction frameworks while leveraging visual scene understanding.

Method: Uses ViT encoder with raw images and past kinematic state as input to produce context embeddings inspired by MTR encoder. Replaces MTR's learnable intention queries with cross-attention on intent and context embeddings. Evaluated on Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset with ablation studies removing images and multiple trajectory outputs.

Result: Transformer-based methods combining visual and kinetic features are not effective at producing useful scene context embeddings, even with CLIP and DINOv2 augmentations. However, predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single trajectory boosts planning performance.

Conclusion: While vision-based embeddings can substitute map features, current transformer architectures struggle to effectively combine visual and kinetic modalities for scene context. Multi-future prediction is crucial for planning performance, suggesting future work should focus on better multimodal fusion techniques.

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

*Daniel Sungho Jung,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FECO framework learns dense foot contact from single RGB images using shoe style-invariant adversarial training and ground-aware learning to overcome challenges of diverse shoe appearances and monotonous ground features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foot contact is crucial for understanding human movement and physical interaction, but existing methods use approximations like zero-velocity constraints and focus on joint-level contact, missing detailed foot-world interaction. Dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images is underexplored despite its importance.

Method: Proposes FECO framework with two key components: 1) Shoe style adversarial training to enforce style-invariant features for contact estimation, overcoming diverse shoe appearances; 2) Ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context to utilize ground information effectively.

Result: The method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information, outperforming existing approaches that fail to capture detailed foot-world interaction.

Conclusion: FECO framework successfully addresses challenges in dense foot contact estimation from single RGB images through shoe style-invariant learning and ground-aware feature extraction, advancing accurate modeling of foot-world interaction.

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

TL;DR: ARPGNet is a facial expression recognition method that combines appearance and relation information using parallel graph attention fusion to learn enhanced spatial-temporal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods rely on pre-trained CNNs for facial appearance but overlook relationships between facial regions, which are crucial for understanding expression dynamics.

Method: Constructs facial region relation graph with graph attention, combines with CNN-based appearance representations, and uses parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual enhancement and temporal dynamics exploration.

Result: Outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on three facial expression recognition datasets.

Conclusion: ARPGNet effectively learns mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations by modeling both appearance and relational information, improving facial expression recognition performance.

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for 3D object generation that eliminates the need for textual inversion training by using an off-the-shelf image adapter and depth-conditioned warmup strategy, achieving comparable performance with improved 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models for 3D object generation rely on textual inversion, which requires additional training time and lacks control ability over conditions like depth, pose, and text.

Method: Two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter to generate 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions; (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency.

Result: Experimental results show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency compared to existing text-inversion-based alternatives. User study confirms better image matching and 3D consistency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses limitations of textual inversion methods by providing faster, more controllable 3D object generation with enhanced 3D consistency, validated through both quantitative metrics and user studies.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based image editing methods produce inconsistent results across different views of the same scene, which is problematic for editing 3D representations like NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models.

Method: Proposes a training-free diffusion framework with a consistency loss that guides diffusion sampling toward coherent edits, assuming corresponding points in unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing.

Result: Significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods and enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to text prompts.

Conclusion: The framework provides flexible, training-free multi-view consistent editing that works with various image editing methods and supports both dense and sparse multi-view setups.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

TL;DR: M3LLM is a medical multi-image MLLM that addresses the limitation of single-image understanding in healthcare by leveraging compound figures from biomedical literature for training, enabling composite reasoning across multiple images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical MLLMs are limited to single-image understanding, which doesn't match real clinical workflows where diagnosis requires synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. There's a lack of large-scale annotated training data for multi-image analysis.

Method: A novel framework using license-permissive compound images from biomedical literature as training data. A five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm with divide-and-conquer strategy decomposes multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks. Over 237,000 compound figures and contextual text were parsed to develop M3LLM.

Result: M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. It shows strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using MIMIC dataset. PMC-MI-Bench benchmark was created for composite understanding.

Conclusion: This work establishes a scalable paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications by enabling multi-image understanding across modalities and time points.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: IE-SRGS is a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting super-resolution method that combines external 2D super-resolution priors with internal 3DGS features to reconstruct high-resolution 3D models from low-resolution inputs, addressing cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing high-resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting models from low-resolution inputs is challenging due to lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods using pre-trained 2D super-resolution models suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity caused by cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps.

Method: IE-SRGS jointly leverages external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. It uses 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employs multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy integrates these two sources to guide 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS effectively addresses the limitations of existing 3DGS super-resolution methods by synergistically combining external 2DSR priors with internal 3DGS features through a mask-guided fusion strategy, achieving superior high-resolution reconstruction results.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel image tampering detection method using adversarial perturbations on SAM to create a "blank canvas" that reveals forged regions when tampering occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC-based image editing has simplified realistic image modification, creating serious risks of image forgery that need effective detection methods.

Method: Instead of training SAM to detect tampering, the approach uses adversarial perturbations to make SAM "blind" to the image, creating a blank canvas. When tampering occurs, SAM can identify forged regions. A frequency-aware optimization strategy enhances this capability by thoroughly deceiving SAM's powerful perception.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for tamper localization.

Conclusion: The novel approach using adversarial perturbations on SAM provides an effective solution for detecting image forgeries by transforming images into blank canvases that reveal modifications.

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTSnap improves test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models by pruning low-quality noise seeds early using noise-aware reward models trained via self-distillation, reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods require fully denoising multiple noise seeds to compute image rewards, which is computationally expensive and limits exploration under fixed budgets.

Method: Proposes noise-aware reward models trained via self-distillation to align intermediate estimate rewards with final clean image rewards, using curriculum training from clean to noisy images, enabling early pruning of poor candidates.

Result: Improves performance by over 16% compared to existing methods, enables more efficient test-time scaling, and provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local optimization.

Conclusion: TTSnap offers an effective framework for computationally efficient test-time scaling by addressing the reward alignment challenge between intermediate noisy estimates and final clean images.

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

### [55] [Semantic Anchoring for Robust Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22245)
*Seoyun Yang,Gihoon Kim,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semantic anchoring method for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, addressing the trade-off between subject fidelity and text-image alignment when learning from few reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with personalization - adapting to user-specific subjects from few reference images. The key challenge is balancing learning new visual concepts while preserving pretrained semantic priors that maintain text-image alignment.

Method: Proposes semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. Reformulates personalization as learning rare concepts guided by their frequent counterparts through semantic anchoring, enabling stable and controlled adaptation.

Result: The method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Semantic anchoring enables expanding pretrained distributions toward personalized regions while preserving semantic structure, solving the trade-off between subject fidelity and text-image alignment in few-shot personalization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreqWarm is a frequency warm-up curriculum that improves generation quality in latent diffusion models by increasing early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals, addressing the reconstruction-generation trade-off in high-dimensional autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off in latent diffusion models: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality declines. The authors trace this gap to different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding - decoders depend on high-frequency latent components for detail recovery, while encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, leading to insufficient exposure and underfitting during diffusion training.

Method: The authors introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training. Through controlled perturbations in RGB and latent domains, they analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and design a method that doesn't require modifying or retraining the autoencoder. FreqWarm is architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

Result: FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality across several high-dimensional autoencoders: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32. The method successfully turns high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

Conclusion: Explicitly managing frequency exposure through FreqWarm can successfully address the reconstruction-generation trade-off in latent diffusion models. The frequency warm-up curriculum improves generation quality without modifying autoencoders, demonstrating that better frequency exposure during training can make high-dimensional latent spaces more suitable for diffusion modeling.

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

TL;DR: UMind-VL is a unified ultrasound foundation model that bridges low-level perception (segmentation, localization) with high-level clinical reasoning (diagnosis) using a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in medical foundation models, ultrasound lacks a comprehensive solution that can handle both pixel-level perception tasks and complex clinical reasoning tasks in a unified manner.

Method: Introduces UMind-DS dataset (1.2M ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions) and UMind-VL architecture with Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs, unifying segmentation, detection, measurement, and diagnosis.

Result: UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization.

Conclusion: UMind-VL successfully bridges the gap between ultrasound grounded perception and comprehensive interpretation, providing a unified foundation model for ultrasound analysis that handles both low-level and high-level tasks effectively.

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSPure is a novel watermark purification framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that effectively removes watermarks while preserving scene integrity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses vulnerabilities in existing 3DGS watermarking schemes, noting that conventional 2D image watermark removal techniques don't generalize well to 3DGS due to its specialized rendering pipeline and unique Gaussian primitive attributes.

Method: GSPure analyzes view-dependent rendering contributions and uses geometrically accurate feature clustering to precisely isolate and remove watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity.

Result: Extensive experiments show GSPure achieves best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss.

Conclusion: GSPure is the first effective watermark purification framework for 3DGS watermarking representations, demonstrating superior performance and generalization compared to existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

### [59] [DriveVGGT: Visual Geometry Transformer for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22264)
*Xiaosong Jia,Yanhao Liu,Junqi You,Renqiu Xia,Yu Hong,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVGGT improves VGGT for autonomous driving by incorporating AD-specific priors like minimal camera overlap, known intrinsics/extrinsics, and fixed camera positions, achieving better 4D reconstruction through temporal attention, multi-camera consistency, and scale/pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct application of VGGT to autonomous driving systems yields sub-optimal results due to different task priors. AD systems have unique characteristics: minimal camera overlap, known camera parameters, and fixed relative camera positions that need to be properly integrated into reconstruction frameworks.

Method: Proposes DriveVGGT with three key components: 1) Temporal Video Attention (TVA) for independent multi-camera video processing leveraging spatiotemporal continuity, 2) Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) with normalized relative pose embeddings for cross-camera consistency, and 3) Extended heads for absolute scale and ego vehicle pose estimation.

Result: DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, and fastVGGT on autonomous driving datasets. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed TVA, MCA, and extended heads in improving reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: DriveVGGT successfully integrates autonomous driving priors into a feed-forward reconstruction framework, demonstrating superior performance for AD applications through specialized attention mechanisms and scale/pose estimation capabilities.

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

### [60] [The Collapse of Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22281)
*Wei Guo,Shunqi Mao,Zhuonan Liang,Heng Wang,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "patch collapse" - a phenomenon where observing certain image patches reduces uncertainty in others, analogous to quantum wave function collapse. The authors develop methods to identify optimal patch realization order and show benefits for masked image modeling and efficient vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that certain image patches contain more information than others, and realizing them in optimal order can improve vision efficiency. The authors draw analogy to quantum mechanics where observing particles collapses wave functions, suggesting similar information collapse occurs in image patches.

Method: The authors learn an autoencoder that softly selects patches to reconstruct each target patch, creating dependency graphs. They use PageRank scoring to determine optimal patch realization order. They apply this to boost autoregressive image generation (MAR model) and introduce a new Vision Transformer setup that only sees high-rank patches.

Result: The patch collapse approach improves state-of-the-art autoregressive image generation (MAR). For Vision Transformers, seeing only 22% of high-rank patches is sufficient to achieve high classification accuracy, demonstrating significant efficiency gains.

Conclusion: Patch collapse provides a novel perspective for image modeling that promotes vision efficiency. The optimal patch realization order benefits various masked image modeling methods and enables more efficient vision systems with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Match-and-Fuse is a zero-shot, training-free method for generating consistent image sets that share common visual elements while varying in viewpoint, time, and surrounding content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods only handle individual images or densely sampled videos, lacking the ability to generate consistent collections of unstructured images that share visual elements but differ in viewpoint, time, and surrounding content.

Method: Models the task as a graph where nodes are images and edges trigger joint generation of image pairs, fusing internal features across pairs using dense input correspondences without masks or manual supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, enabling new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse provides an effective zero-shot framework for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets, advancing content creation capabilities.

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

TL;DR: MVMAE is a self-supervised framework that uses multi-view radiology images and reports to learn robust medical representations, outperforming baselines on disease classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical ML systems need pretraining strategies that exploit clinical data structure. Radiology studies have natural multi-view organization and textual reports that can provide powerful self-supervisory signals for learning robust representations.

Method: MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment of multi-view radiology images. MVMAE-V2T extends this by incorporating radiology reports as auxiliary text-based learning signals while maintaining vision-only inference.

Result: MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines on disease classification across three large-scale public datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, PadChest). MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, especially in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: Structural supervision (multi-view organization) and textual supervision (radiology reports) are complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Swin Transformer-based neck architecture for small object detection, specifically targeting birds, by modifying window sizes to improve feature learning for small, sparse objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection is challenging due to size, blur, and occlusion. Current methods focus on small and dense objects, but there's a lack of effective approaches for small and sparse objects like birds, where training data is limited.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical neck design using Swin Transformer to upsample image features. Modifies shifted window sizes to adapt to small objects, combined with CenterNet framework for detection.

Result: Experiments show the Swin Transformer-based neck with CenterNet achieves good performance. Smaller window sizes (default 2) improve mAP for small object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses small, sparse object detection by adapting Swin Transformer window sizes, demonstrating improved performance for bird detection tasks.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video colorization methods suffer from temporal flickering or require extensive manual input, creating a need for automated high-fidelity solutions.

Method: Uses language-conditioned diffusion model with automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; employs optical flow (RAFT) for temporal stability by warping color from previous frames, plus correction step for inconsistencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS30 and VIDEVO20 benchmarks in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC).

Conclusion: Demonstrates efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization without requiring specific color input.

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) evaluations on multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, beyond the known answer choice order sensitivity.

Method: Conducted a large-scale study analyzing three key variation factors in prompt formatting across seven MLLMs and five VQA datasets, spanning 48 distinct prompt format variations to measure sensitivity to minor, semantically neutral changes.

Result: Multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes even when semantically neutral; these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer; existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

Conclusion: Current MLLM evaluations on multiple-choice VQA benchmarks are unreliable due to unexplored prompt formatting biases, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methodologies that account for these formatting sensitivities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

TL;DR: A novel alignment strategy for Normalizing Flows that leverages invertibility to align generative pass features with vision foundation model representations, improving semantic quality and accelerating training by 3.3× while achieving SOTA results on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Normalizing Flows have limited generative quality due to poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. The authors aim to improve the semantic quality of NF representations while maintaining their invertible architecture advantages.

Method: Proposes a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages NF invertibility: instead of regularizing the forward pass, aligns intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model. Also introduces a training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification to evaluate semantic knowledge.

Result: The approach accelerates NF training by over 3.3× while simultaneously improving both generative quality and classification accuracy. Achieves new state-of-the-art results for NFs on ImageNet 64×64 and 256×256 resolutions.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment strategy effectively addresses the semantic representation limitations of standard NFs by leveraging their invertibility and aligning with foundation models, resulting in faster training and superior performance on both generation and classification tasks.

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

TL;DR: INSIGHT is an interpretable multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16-64x64), combining super-resolution, localization, semantic alignment, and vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing realism of AI-generated images intensifies concerns over visual media reliability, but current forensic systems degrade under real-world conditions (downsampling, compression, cross-domain shifts) and operate as opaque classifiers offering little insight, undermining trust in high-stakes settings.

Method: INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions with generative patterns, CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors, and a vision-language model prompted with structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol for consistent explanations verified through dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline.

Result: Across diverse domains (animals, vehicles, abstract synthetic scenes), INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines.

Conclusion: INSIGHT highlights a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establishes a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification by providing both robust detection and interpretable explanations.

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

TL;DR: AnchorFlow introduces a training-free 3D editing method using latent anchor consistency to achieve stable, semantically faithful edits without mask supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free 3D editing approaches struggle with producing strong or geometrically stable edits due to inconsistent latent anchors from timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling.

Method: AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between source and target trajectories, enforcing coherence through a relaxed anchor-alignment loss and anchor-aligned update rule to ensure stable transformations.

Result: Experiments on Eval3DEdit benchmark show AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types, enabling more pronounced semantic modifications.

Conclusion: AnchorFlow provides a mask-free, training-free 3D editing solution that stabilizes latent reference space for geometrically stable and semantically faithful edits.

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

TL;DR: RS-EoT addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing vision-language models by introducing an iterative evidence-seeking paradigm that mitigates the Glance Effect through SocraticAgent self-play and progressive reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models in remote sensing tasks exhibit widespread pseudo reasoning - they narrate reasoning processes rather than genuinely reasoning based on visual evidence, attributed to the Glance Effect where coarse perception leads to incomplete understanding.

Method: Proposes RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. Uses SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. Implements two-stage progressive RL: first RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, then RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios.

Result: RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed RS-EoT paradigm effectively addresses pseudo reasoning in remote sensing vision-language models by enabling genuine evidence-grounded reasoning through iterative visual evidence seeking, overcoming the limitations of the Glance Effect.

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs with its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, overcoming real-world data collection limitations.

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D head stylization methods require computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning for new styles, limiting their practicality and flexibility for diverse artistic applications.

Method: Builds on DiffPortrait360 architecture with two key components: Style Appearance Module for disentangling style from content, and Style Fusion Attention for adaptive balance between structure preservation and stylization fidelity. Uses 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for fine-tuning and temperature-based key scaling for stylization intensity control.

Conclusion: DiffStyle360 enables efficient, high-quality 3D head stylization from single reference images without per-style training, advancing practical applications in character design and digital media.

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

*Minghao Yin,Yukang Cao,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WUKONG is a training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing using flow-based transformers, solving optimal transport barycenter problems for smooth shape transitions and preserving texture details through semantic consistency mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional 3D morphing methods rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation, which limits generalization and requires costly preprocessing. There's a need for a more efficient, high-fidelity approach to 3D morphing with rich texture details.

Method: WUKONG leverages flow-based transformers' generative prior for 3D transitions, formulates morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem for smooth shape transitions, uses sequential initialization to prevent geometric distortions, and employs similarity-guided semantic consistency for texture preservation with selective high-frequency detail retention.

Result: Extensive evaluations show WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations while avoiding common artifacts like oversmoothing.

Conclusion: WUKONG provides an effective training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that overcomes limitations of conventional methods, offering better generalization, reduced preprocessing costs, and superior quality results.

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

*Weining Ren,Hongjun Wang,Xiao Tan,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fin3R is a lightweight fine-tuning method that enhances feed-forward 3D reconstruction models by distilling fine geometric details from a monocular teacher model using LoRA adapters, improving geometric accuracy without increasing inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feed-forward 3D reconstruction models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to two main issues: (1) scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision, and (2) inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression.

Method: Fin3R freezes the decoder (handles view matching) and fine-tunes only the image encoder using a lightweight LoRA adapter. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets.

Result: Fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only tiny LoRA weights that leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Conclusion: Fin3R provides a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method that significantly improves geometric accuracy of feed-forward 3D reconstruction models with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkeletonAgent is a novel framework that integrates LLMs with skeleton-based action recognition through cooperative Questioner and Selector agents to provide targeted discriminative guidance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use LLMs in isolation from recognition models without performance feedback, failing to provide targeted discriminative cues needed to distinguish similar actions in skeleton-based recognition.

Method: Proposes SkeletonAgent with two cooperative agents: Questioner identifies confused classes for LLM context, and Selector parses LLM responses to extract joint-level constraints for finer-grained cross-modal alignment with the recognizer.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks (NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, UAV-Human) show SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent effectively bridges LLMs and recognition models through cooperative agents, enabling targeted discriminative guidance that improves skeleton-based action recognition performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

TL;DR: ABounD is a unified adversarial boundary-driven framework for few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping to improve discrimination between normal and abnormal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection is challenging due to data scarcity that blurs boundaries between normal and abnormal states, causing missed subtle defects and rejection of atypical normal samples. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative.

Method: ABounD integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping through two modules: Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, and Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts precise decision margins by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training uses single-stage Concept-Boundary Loss with semantic-spatial regularizers.

Result: Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in few-shot multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: ABounD successfully addresses the challenges of few-shot anomaly detection by creating a unified framework that yields decision boundaries closely following normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Motivation: Deepfake generation has advanced significantly, raising serious concerns about misuse of manipulated media. There's an urgent need for robust and reliable deepfake detection methods, particularly focusing on zero-shot detection (generalizable detection) that can work across different generation techniques.

Method: Proposes FauxNet based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. Extracts temporal VSR features from videos to identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. Focuses on zero-shot detection and attribution of generation techniques.

Result: FauxNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot detection setting. It can attribute deepfakes to specific generation techniques. Introduces new datasets Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF with ~38,000 real and fake videos created with six recent deepfake generation techniques.

Conclusion: FauxNet demonstrates superior performance on Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, providing effective deepfake detection with generalization capability and attribution ability. The Authentica datasets will be publicly available to advance research in this field.

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Benchmark study shows CNNs with min-max normalization offer best trade-off for quantum dot state recognition from charge-stability diagrams, outperforming more complex models on experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling quantum dot arrays requires automated tuning strategies that depend on accurate state identification from charge-stability diagrams, necessitating evaluation of machine learning approaches for this task.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking of four ML architectures (U-Nets, visual transformers, CNNs, MDNs) for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs, evaluating performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data.

Result: U-Nets and ViTs achieve highest MSE scores (>0.98) on synthetic data but fail to generalize to experimental data. CNNs offer best trade-off on experimental CSDs with strong accuracy and two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Min-max scaling yields higher accuracy but less stable convergence, while z-score normalization provides more predictable training at reduced accuracy.

Conclusion: CNNs with min-max normalization are the most practical approach for quantum dot charge-stability diagram state recognition, balancing accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization to experimental data.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a paradigm shift from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos through intent analysis, providing a new benchmark and methodology for understanding motivations behind manipulated content.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative quality in text-guided 3D diffusion models without requiring additional training, addressing the need for improved inference-time performance.

Method: Formulates inference-time scaling as an optimization problem to find optimal Gaussian noise inputs. Uses verifier-guided search algorithm with three key techniques: Gaussian normalization for stability, SVD-based compression for efficiency, and singular space reset for exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate enhanced text-to-3D generation quality, showing the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Conclusion: ITS3D successfully improves 3D generation quality through inference-time optimization, offering an effective approach that doesn't require additional training while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

TL;DR: A method for 3D dynamic fire reconstruction from limited camera views using Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation, addressing challenges of fire's volatile nature and transparency with only three views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire reconstruction is challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and high-frequency features. The goal is to reconstruct fire from only three views, which requires solving under-constrained geometry problems.

Method: Separates static background from dynamic fire using dense multi-view stereo with monocular depth priors. Initializes fire as 3D flow field from fused per-view dense optical flow projections. Uses 3D Gaussians with lifetime and linear velocity encoding to capture high-frequency features. Employs custom hardware synchronization for sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios using affordable commodity hardware.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully reconstructs dynamic fire in 3D from limited camera views by combining Gaussian-based representation with optical flow fusion and hardware synchronization, enabling practical fire reconstruction with minimal equipment.

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench addresses the gap in reasoning capabilities for road scene understanding, enabling models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning for autonomous driving and digital map construction.

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module with Vision-Language Model for text-based person anomaly retrieval, achieving SOTA results with significant improvements in retrieval metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-based person anomaly retrieval approaches rely on complex deep-learning techniques, raising the research question of how to optimize models for better fine-grained feature extraction to improve retrieval performance.

Method: Proposes LHP module integrated with VLM to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained features; investigates Unified Image-Text model with multiple loss functions (ITC, ITM, MLM, MIM); introduces novel iterative ensemble strategy and feature selection algorithm guided by LHP performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on PAB dataset with 9.70% improvement in R@1, 1.77% improvement in R@5, and 1.01% improvement in R@10 compared to previous work.

Conclusion: The proposed LHP module with VLM integration, combined with the iterative ensemble strategy and feature selection algorithm, effectively improves text-based person anomaly retrieval performance by better capturing both fine-grained and coarse-grained features.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frozen DINOv3 foundation model shows strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning, using global low-frequency structures as transferable authenticity cues rather than generator-specific artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-generator detection is challenging as existing methods memorize specific generator artifacts rather than learning transferable cues, leading to failures on unseen generators.

Method: Systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives reveal DINOv3's reliance on global low-frequency structures. A training-free token-ranking strategy selects authenticity-relevant tokens, followed by a lightweight linear probe.

Result: The selected token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets, demonstrating DINOv3's strong cross-generator detection capability without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Foundation models like DINOv3 generalize across diverse generators using global low-frequency structures as transferable authenticity cues, providing a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a comprehensive talking head generation system that can simultaneously learn and generate lip motion, facial expressions, and head pose movements from audio input, addressing the challenge of producing realistic and synchronized facial animations.

Method: Proposes Dimitra++ framework with a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) that models facial motion sequences using 3D representations. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image for appearance and an audio sequence for motion generation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments, plus user studies on VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ datasets, show that Dimitra++ outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads with synchronized lip motion, facial expressions, and head pose.

Conclusion: Dimitra++ successfully demonstrates superior performance in audio-driven talking head generation by effectively modeling comprehensive facial motion including lip synchronization, expressions, and head movements through its conditional diffusion transformer approach.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we propose a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) to model facial motion sequences, employing a 3D representation. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

TL;DR: SciPostGen is a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating scientific poster layouts from papers, with a retrieval-augmented framework that generates layouts aligned with paper structures and user constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As scientific papers grow in number, posters become increasingly important for presenting research effectively. There's a gap in understanding how papers correspond to poster layouts, requiring large-scale paired datasets.

Method: Introduces SciPostGen dataset and a Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation framework that retrieves layouts consistent with given papers and uses them as guidance for layout generation.

Result: Analyses show paper structures correlate with layout element counts. The retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and the framework generates layouts satisfying both paper alignment and user constraints.

Conclusion: The SciPostGen dataset and retrieval-augmented framework effectively bridge the gap between paper content and poster layout generation, enabling better research communication through optimized poster designs.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

*Hyakka Nakada,Marika Kubota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses text removal from document images with dense text, creating benchmark data and developing a method using Bayesian optimization to model flexible mask profiles for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text removal methods focus on simple scene text in outdoor images, but there's little research on complex document images with dense text. Industrial applications need better text removal from documents, and current methods are vulnerable to mask profile perturbations.

Method: Created benchmark data for text removal from images with dense text. Developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. Found that character-wise masks work best and that minimum cover of text regions is not optimal.

Result: The study found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable to mask profile perturbation, and precise tuning of mask shape is essential. Bayesian optimization produced character-wise masks, and minimum text region coverage was not optimal.

Conclusion: The research provides a user-friendly guideline for manual masking in text removal tasks and paves the way for better practical text removal from document images with dense text using optimized mask profiles.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

*Ahmad Mohammadshirazi,Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi,Dheeraj Kulshrestha,Rajiv Ramnath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DocVAL is a distillation framework that transfers spatial reasoning from large teacher models to deployable student VLMs for DocVQA, achieving high accuracy without text detection at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DocVQA systems face a sharp accuracy-efficiency trade-off: large teacher models provide strong spatial grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact student models suffer substantial drops in localization performance.

Method: DocVAL uses validated chain-of-thought distillation with three components: 1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter/denoise training signals, 2) a multi-module validator (VAL) enforcing answer correctness and geometric consistency with pixel-level error feedback, and 3) a two-stage student training scheme learning from validated CoT traces followed by iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback.

Result: The student model (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4% ANLS and 82.4% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement.

Conclusion: DocVAL successfully transfers spatial reasoning capabilities from large teachers to deployable students, addressing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in DocVQA while releasing 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research.

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning.

Method: CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. It explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action Chain-of-Thought during training to align reasoning space with action space across multiple driving tasks, and performs implicit CoT reasoning during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated benchmarks (nuScenes and Bench2Drive) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations.

Conclusion: CoT4AD successfully enhances numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieving superior performance in complex driving scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast3Dcache is a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity, achieving up to 27.12% speed-up with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have impressive generative quality but computationally expensive inference due to iterative denoising. Existing caching methods for 2D/video generation cause geometric inconsistencies when applied to 3D diffusion models due to accumulated numerical errors in cached latent features.

Method: Proposes Fast3Dcache with two key components: 1) Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas based on voxel stabilization patterns, and 2) Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion.

Result: Achieves up to 27.12% speed-up and 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal geometric quality degradation: 2.48% in Chamfer Distance and 1.95% in F-Score.

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache effectively accelerates 3D diffusion inference while maintaining geometric fidelity through geometry-aware caching, overcoming limitations of existing caching methods that disrupt 3D geometric consistency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image compression methods are optimized separately for human perception or machine analysis tasks, but there are fundamental commonalities between these objectives. Preserving accurate semantic information is crucial for both intelligent tasks and human understanding, while enhanced perceptual quality benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks.

Method: Proposes Diff-ICMH framework that leverages generative priors for perceptual realism and incorporates Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) to guarantee semantic fidelity. Introduces Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that uses image-level tags to stimulate pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities with minimal additional bit rates.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks while maintaining visual appeal for human perception. The framework supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without task-specific adaptation.

Conclusion: Diff-ICMH successfully harmonizes machine and human vision in image compression by simultaneously ensuring semantic fidelity and perceptual realism, achieving superior performance across both domains with a unified approach.

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception.

We introduce a Dual-UV representation that maps image features to a canonical UV space via Core-UV and Shell-UV branches, eliminating pose- and framing-induced token shifts. We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency.

TL;DR: TCEAD is a text-conditioned AI framework for automated dental implant abutment design that improves localization accuracy by 0.8%-12.85% IoU over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional dental implant abutment design is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and inappropriate designs can lead to complications like peri-implantitis. AI-assisted design can improve efficiency and adaptability.

Method: Extends MeshMAE self-supervised learning with a text-guided localization module using CLIP text encoder. Pre-trains encoder on oral scan data for better feature extraction of fine-grained implant features.

Result: Achieves 0.8%-12.85% IoU improvement over mainstream methods on a large abutment design dataset, demonstrating superior localization performance.

Conclusion: TCEAD shows strong potential for automated dental abutment design by effectively combining text guidance with mesh-based learning for accurate abutment area localization.

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual CoT accelerates convergence but doesn't improve final performance; concise grounding CoT outperforms longer traces; minimal grounding CoT generalizes best across different maze sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models, and to determine which CoT formats truly support generalizable reasoning rather than just accelerating training.

Method: Systematic evaluation using a controlled maze-solving benchmark with fully visual reasoning rules, tunable difficulty via grid size, and automatically generated intermediate steps. Compared three CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations) using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under standard SFT-then-RL pipeline.

Result: Visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but don't lift final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; minimal grounding CoT generalizes best across different maze sizes. These insights were validated on other vision-centric tasks.

Conclusion: Reveals a "short is long" effect where concise, minimal grounding CoT leads to best generalization. Provides practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning by focusing on essential grounding steps rather than verbose or complex CoT formats.

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

*Haoxi Zeng,Haoxuan Li,Yi Bin,Pengpeng Zeng,Xing Xu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HarmoCLIP is a framework that harmonizes global and region representations in CLIP by introducing explicit fine-grained semantic supervision and Region-Language Alignment to address the trade-off between local perception and global coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP lacks region-level supervision, limiting its fine-grained semantic understanding. Existing methods to improve local perception unintentionally disrupt global alignment, creating a persistent trade-off between local and global representations.

Method: HarmoCLIP introduces explicit fine-grained semantic supervision that directly aligns textual segments with corresponding visual regions, bridging image region space and textual space. It also uses a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy to promote fine-grained learning without compromising global consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on global retrieval tasks (up to 69.78% improvement) and substantial 3.2% Top-1 accuracy improvement on bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing balanced, efficient plug-and-play solution.

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP successfully addresses the global-local trade-off in CLIP by harmonizing representations, demonstrating superior performance on both global and region-level tasks while maintaining efficiency and plug-and-play compatibility.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot anomaly detection methods produce coarse anomaly maps due to patch-level ViT features. Recent solutions using synthetic anomalies struggle with fine-grained detection due to the gap between synthetic and real anomalies. The authors observed that anomaly score maps provide complementary spatial cues missing from ZSAD's image features.

Method: Proposes AnoRefiner with two main components: 1) Anomaly Refinement Decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing reliance on synthetic data. 2) Progressive Group-wise Test-time Training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for refinement in the next group, compatible with any ZSAD method.

Result: Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets show AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to 5.2% gain in pixel-AP metrics, with improvements directly observable in visualizations.

Conclusion: AnoRefiner effectively bridges the gap between patch-level and pixel-level anomaly detection by leveraging complementary information from anomaly score maps, achieving significant performance improvements without synthetic anomaly data.

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current gaze accuracy in VR/AR applications is insufficient for spatial computing requirements, necessitating more precise gaze tracking methods.

Method: 1) Created GazeTrack dataset with diverse demographics using high-precision equipment; 2) Shape error regularization for pupil ellipse fitting; 3) Paper unfolding-like coordinate transformation for gaze vector prediction; 4) Trained on open-source datasets for semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction.

Result: Built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework with novel regularization and transformation methods significantly improves gaze tracking accuracy for spatial computing applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

TL;DR: A latent drift-guided replay method for continual learning in medical imaging that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new hospital data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in deep learning models severely limits AI deployment in medical imaging, where models need to continually adapt to new hospital data without losing previously learned diagnostic knowledge.

Method: Introduces a latent drift-guided replay method that quantifies representational instability via latent drift (change in internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation), aggregates drift at patient level, and stores per-patient slices with greatest multi-layer representation shift in a memory buffer.

Result: The method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay when evaluated on cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification tasks using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones.

Conclusion: Latent drift serves as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real-world medical settings, addressing the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting in medical AI deployment.

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reasoning-enhanced image editing framework that unlocks MLLM capabilities through thinking and reflection mechanisms in a loop, achieving significant performance improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models freeze MLLM encoders during training, limiting their reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to demonstrate that unlocking MLLM reasoning can push editing model boundaries further.

Method: Proposes a thinking-editing-reflection loop: thinking mechanism interprets abstract instructions using MLLM world knowledge; reflection reviews results, corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies stopping round. Two implementations: ReasonEdit-S (initialized from Step1X-Edit) and ReasonEdit-Q (integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit).

Result: Significant performance gains: ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) with ReasonEdit-S; outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris with ReasonEdit-Q.

Conclusion: Unlocking MLLM reasoning capabilities through thinking and reflection mechanisms significantly enhances image editing performance, demonstrating the value of incorporating reasoning loops into editing frameworks.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhance reasoning in remote sensing MLLMs require expensive chain-of-thought data annotation, which introduces human biases and limits reasoning diversity. The authors aim to develop a framework that enables geospatial reasoning without predefined CoT supervision.

Method: The framework uses two datasets: GeoZero-Instruct for supervised fine-tuning to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge, and GeoZero-Hard to stimulate deep reasoning during reinforcement learning. They introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A²GRPO), which regularizes the reasoning process using the model's own answers to encourage diverse yet accurate thinking.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks show that GeoZero surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods and fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

Conclusion: GeoZero successfully enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without predefined CoT supervision, addressing annotation cost and bias issues while achieving superior performance and emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss to mitigate task conflicts in unified multimodal models without model decoupling, improving both generation and understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models face inherent conflicts between understanding and generation tasks. Current solutions use model decoupling, but this sacrifices interleave generation ability. The authors aim to address task conflicts without decoupling.

Method: Analyzed why decoupling works by studying cross-modal attention behavior, finding it drives models toward task-specific interaction patterns. Proposed AIA loss to explicitly learn these patterns during training. Applied AIA to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stages.

Result: AIA loss refines cross-modal attention patterns and boosts both generation and understanding performance without additional architectural changes.

Conclusion: The AIA loss provides an effective way to mitigate task conflicts in unified multimodal models without resorting to model decoupling, preserving interleave generation ability while improving performance.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

TL;DR: VaMP introduces variational multi-modal prompt learning that generates instance-specific, uncertainty-aware prompts by sampling from learned posterior distributions, improving few-shot and domain generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods use fixed, shared prompts with deterministic parameters, which cannot capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains, limiting adaptation to downstream tasks with limited supervision.

Method: Proposes Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from learned posterior distribution, introduces class-aware prior from instance representation and class prototype, and formulates prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations trained end-to-end through reparameterized sampling.

Result: Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure.

Conclusion: VaMP enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning, effectively capturing instance-level variation and improving adaptation to downstream tasks with limited supervision.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the conventional understanding of Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), revealing that in text-to-image generation with CFG, the primary driver is CFG Augmentation (CA) rather than distribution matching, with DM serving as a regularizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional understanding that Distribution Matching Distillation's performance comes from matching student and teacher distributions, and to provide a more principled analysis of the actual mechanisms driving few-step diffusion model distillation.

Method: Rigorous decomposition of DMD training objective, identification of CFG Augmentation (CA) as the core engine, analysis of Distribution Matching (DM) as a regularizer, validation through alternative regularization methods, and principled modifications like decoupling noise schedules.

Result: The paper demonstrates that CFG Augmentation is the primary driver of distillation, while DM serves as a stabilizer; shows alternative regularizers can work; and achieves performance gains through modified distillation processes, validated by adoption in Z-Image project.

Conclusion: The conventional understanding of DMD is incomplete - CFG Augmentation is the core engine of distillation while Distribution Matching acts as a regularizer, enabling more systematic analysis and principled improvements to diffusion model distillation.

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

TL;DR: 3D foundation models show emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, and a lightweight alignment scheme improves relative pose estimation without degrading depth quality, with a new benchmark MegaUnScene introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D foundation models have advanced 3D vision, their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains unexplored. The paper aims to study their internal representations and enhance capabilities for extreme-view geometry.

Method: 1) Analyze internal representations of 3DFMs for extreme-view understanding; 2) Introduce lightweight alignment scheme that refines 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms while keeping decoder heads frozen; 3) Create MegaUnScene benchmark with test splits for relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction.

Result: 3DFMs exhibit emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry despite no training for such conditions. The lightweight alignment scheme substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality.

Conclusion: 3D foundation models possess inherent extreme-view geometry understanding that can be enhanced through targeted adaptation. The proposed lightweight alignment scheme and MegaUnScene benchmark advance extreme-view 3D reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework successfully disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering, enabling reliable multi-human generation with accurate person placement and identity preservation through novel architectural design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. The work demonstrates that efficient, accessible generative models can compete with proprietary systems, fostering development of budget-friendly yet high-performance alternatives.

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: ReAG effectively addresses limitations of current retrieval-augmented MLLMs for knowledge-intensive VQA by combining improved retrieval with enhanced reasoning capabilities, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start.

TL;DR: Splat-SAP is a feed-forward method for novel view synthesis of human-centered scenes from sparse binocular cameras using Gaussian Splatting with point map geometry representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods require dense input views or largely overlapped views for geometry priors, limiting their application to sparse binocular camera setups common in human-centered scenes.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Self-supervised iterative affinity learning to transform point maps into real space for camera control, 2) Projection of binocular point maps to target view with stereo matching refinement, then anchoring Gaussian primitives for rendering.

Result: The method improves both stability of point map reconstruction and visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering on collected multi-view human-centered data compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Splat-SAP enables high-quality novel view synthesis from sparse binocular cameras through robust point map geometry representation and two-stage learning, advancing feed-forward Gaussian Splatting for human-centered scenes.

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

TL;DR: DIPT: Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning for pathology domain generalization via vision-language model knowledge distillation with learned domain-specific prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in computational pathology due to staining/scanner variations across clinical centers limit model generalization. Vision-language models like PLIP offer knowledge but have limited zero-shot performance due to prompt sensitivity, and histopathology lacks semantic descriptors for domain-specific prompts.

Method: Propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) that learns multiple input tokens per domain, trains them separately, then averages across domains to create domain-invariant prompts. Student model distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder using these prompts to align visual features with domain-invariant embeddings.

Result: Significant improvement in average F1-score over existing state-of-the-art knowledge distillation approaches for domain generalization on histopathology datasets.

Conclusion: DIPT enables robust computational pathology model deployment in real-world clinical settings with heterogeneous data sources by enhancing domain generalization through learned domain-invariant prompts.

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

TL;DR: A 3-channel DDPM was fine-tuned to generate realistic paired CC/MLO mammograms, with sum/absolute difference encodings performing best for cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for synthesizing anatomically consistent dual-view mammograms (CC and MLO views) for potential dataset augmentation applications in breast cancer screening.

Method: Fine-tuned a pretrained 3-channel DDPM on 11,020 mammograms, evaluating three third-channel encodings (sum, absolute difference, zero). Generated 500 synthetic pairs and assessed using IoU/DSC for segmentation, EMD/KS for distribution comparison, and visual Turing tests.

Result: Synthetic mammograms showed comparable IoU/DSC distributions to real images (EMD=0.020, KS=0.077). Sum/absolute difference encodings outperformed others (p<0.001). Generated views maintained cross-view consistency with 6-8% showing artifacts similar to training data.

Conclusion: 3-channel DDPMs can generate realistic, anatomically consistent dual-view mammograms, showing promise for dataset augmentation in breast cancer screening applications.

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

### [111] [Leveraging Textual Compositional Reasoning for Robust Change Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22903)
*Kyu Ri Park,Jiyoung Park,Seong Tae Kim,Hong Joo Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORTEX is a novel framework for change captioning that integrates textual cues from Vision Language Models to capture subtle changes that visual features alone miss, using compositional reasoning descriptions and dual alignment of visual and textual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing change captioning methods rely solely on visual features, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes due to lack of explicit structured information like object relationships and compositional semantics.

Method: CORTEX integrates textual cues with visual features through three modules: 1) Image-level Change Detector for low-level visual differences, 2) Reasoning-aware Text Extraction module using VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions, and 3) Image-Text Dual Alignment module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning.

Result: The framework enables reasoning over both visual and textual features to capture changes that are ambiguous in visual features alone, enhancing change understanding through complementary textual cues.

Conclusion: CORTEX represents a significant advancement in change captioning by leveraging textual knowledge from VLMs to overcome limitations of visual-only approaches, enabling better capture of subtle changes through compositional reasoning.

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

### [112] [Artwork Interpretation with Vision Language Models: A Case Study on Emotions and Emotion Symbols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22929)
*Sebastian Padó,Kerstin Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can recognize content and emotions in artworks but struggle with abstract/symbolic images and show inconsistency in related questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well current vision language models can detect and analyze emotional expression in artworks, given the abstract nature of emotions in art and the need for art historical expertise.

Method: Case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) with four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, emotion symbols), followed by qualitative expert evaluation.

Result: VLMs recognize image content surprisingly well and often identify depicted emotions and their expression. Performance is best for concrete images but fails for highly abstract or symbolic images. Symbol recognition remains fundamentally difficult, and models exhibit inconsistency in related questions.

Conclusion: Current VLMs show promising capabilities for analyzing emotional content in artworks but have limitations with abstraction, symbolism, and consistency, indicating areas for future improvement in art analysis applications.

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates VIS-TIR fusion methods for automated wildlife detection using YOLO11n, showing both early and late fusion improve F1 scores over VIS-only models for great blue heron monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient wildlife monitoring is needed for conservation, and combining VIS-TIR imagery offers promising improvements over single-source methods, though alignment/fusion challenges exist due to different FOVs and resolutions.

Method: Used synchronous aerial VIS-TIR imagery with YOLO11n model; tested early fusion (PCA on aligned VIS-TIR pairs) and late fusion (CART on VIS-only and TIR-only detections); automated alignment with deep learning.

Result: Both fusion methods improved F1 scores across all classes; late fusion increased occupied nest F1 from 90.2% (VIS-only) to 93.0%; late fusion identified false positives with 90% recall.

Conclusion: Fusion methods provide better detection results but face TIR FOV and alignment constraints; very high-resolution visible sensors could be more practical for operational surveys.

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD), a large-scale benchmark for Indian language scene text recognition, addressing gaps in datasets and models for this challenging domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge despite significant advances in English scene text recognition, due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, varying writing styles, and lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models.

Method: Created BSTD dataset with over 100K words spanning 11 Indian languages and English from 6,500+ scene images across India, with meticulous annotations supporting multiple tasks. Evaluated state-of-the-art English models by adapting them for Indian languages through fine-tuning.

Result: The dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of scene text tasks including detection, script identification, word recognition, and end-to-end recognition. Results highlight both challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition.

Conclusion: BSTD represents a significant step toward advancing research in Indian language scene text recognition, with all models and data being open source to facilitate further development in this domain.

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

TL;DR: A hybrid deep learning model combining CNNs, Vision Transformers, and BiLSTM networks achieves 95.05% accuracy in predicting MCI progression to Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal MRI data and biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment is critical for timely intervention, but predicting which MCI patients will progress to AD remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of MCI progression.

Method: Proposed an end-to-end deep learning model integrating CNNs and Vision Transformers to capture spatial features from MRI scans, combined with BiLSTM networks to model temporal progression using four consecutive MRI timepoints and non-image biomarkers.

Result: Achieved 95.05% average accuracy in distinguishing between stable MCI and progressive MCI, outperforming existing studies and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining spatial and temporal modeling effectively enables early detection of Alzheimer's disease progression, showing promise for clinical applications in predicting MCI conversion to AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LVLMs can process road-facing camera data for safety descriptions, comprehensive safety monitoring requires synchronized processing of both driver-facing and road-facing views to detect risky behaviors like mobile phone use while driving.

Method: Developed models and investigated LVLM capabilities by constructing a dataset and evaluating performance on synchronized driver-facing and road-facing camera inputs.

Result: Pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, but fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Challenges remain in detecting subtle or complex events in video.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LVLMs show promise for safety monitoring in autonomous driving by processing synchronized camera inputs, but need improvement for detecting subtle/complex events. Findings provide valuable insights for LVLM-based system development in this domain.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

TL;DR: MIMM-X is a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations in medical imaging by minimizing mutual information, improving generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often rely on spurious correlations (shortcut learning), leading to poor generalization across different environments. This is particularly problematic in medical contexts where multiple spurious correlations can coexist and misclassifications have severe consequences.

Method: MIMM-X disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. This framework ensures predictions are based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts.

Result: The framework was evaluated on three medical datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Conclusion: MIMM-X provides an effective solution for addressing shortcut learning in medical imaging by disentangling causal features from multiple spurious correlations, leading to more robust and generalizable models for clinical applications.

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with culture mixing scenarios where cultural elements from different origins appear together in visual scenes, showing failures in preserving individual cultural identities and strong background reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together in visual scenes, but how Large Vision-Language Models perceive these culture mixing scenarios remains underexplored, representing a critical challenge for reliable operation in culturally diverse environments.

Method: Constructed CultureMix, a food VQA benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: food-only, food+food, food+background, and food+food+background. Evaluated 10 LVLMs and explored three robustness strategies including supervised fine-tuning with diverse culture mixing datasets.

Result: LVLMs show consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings, strong background reliance (accuracy drops 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines), and produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. Supervised fine-tuning with diverse culture mixing data substantially improves model consistency and reduces background sensitivity.

Conclusion: Culture mixing scenarios represent a critical challenge for LVLMs that requires increased attention. Supervised fine-tuning with diverse culture mixing datasets can improve model robustness, representing an important step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: ViRL introduces visual rationalization as core reasoning primitives (visual Chain-of-Thought) and trains models end-to-end with process supervision and reward shaping to ensure each visual action meaningfully contributes to correct reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat visual actions as optional tools, creating an "illusion of thinking with images" where models appear visually grounded but use context-agnostic actions that don't refine perception or guide reasoning toward correct answers.

Method: Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL) reframes visual actions as core reasoning primitives. It uses: 1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, 2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and 3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions.

Result: ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning when trained purely with end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Visual rationalization establishes a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models that "get the right answer for the right visual reason."

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

TL;DR: CogIP-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on subjective image cognitive properties like memorability, humor, aesthetics, and emotional impact, showing current models lack human-like perception but can be improved through post-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at objective image understanding (identifying objects, describing scenes) but fail to capture subjective human cognitive properties like what makes images memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative.

Method: 1) Introduce CogIP-Bench benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on image cognitive properties; 2) Conduct evaluation revealing poor alignment with human perception; 3) Implement post-training phase to bridge this gap; 4) Demonstrate transferability to downstream creative tasks by integrating cognitively-aligned MLLM into image generation pipeline.

Result: Evaluation shows significant gap between current models and human perception of cognitive properties. Post-training effectively bridges this gap, enhancing model alignment with human judgments. The learned cognitive alignment is transferable to creative tasks, enabling generation of images with desired traits like memorability and visual appeal.

Conclusion: The work provides: 1) a benchmark to measure human-like perception in MLLMs, 2) a post-training pipeline to enhance cognitive alignment, and 3) demonstration that this alignment enables more human-centric AI applications, particularly in creative image generation.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC4-DViT combines text-guided diffusion for generating balanced training data with a deformable Vision Transformer for improved land-cover classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on aerial imagery datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely, accurate land-cover maps are critical for environmental applications, but remote sensing classification faces challenges with scarce/imbalanced annotations and geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes.

Method: Proposes LC4-DViT framework: 1) Text-guided diffusion pipeline using GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced training images; 2) DViT architecture combining DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with Vision Transformer encoder to capture both fine-scale geometry and global context.

Result: On AID dataset (8 classes): 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, 0.9510 Cohen's Kappa, outperforming vanilla ViT, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset transfer on SIRI-WHU subset: 0.9333 OA, 0.9316 macro F1, 0.8989 Kappa. GPT-4o evaluation shows DViT's attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures.

Conclusion: Description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping, addressing annotation scarcity and geometric distortion challenges.

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

TL;DR: Generative inpainting for removing artifacts from pediatric hand radiographs significantly degrades bone age and gender prediction performance, despite appearing visually realistic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether generative foundation model-based inpainting for removing non-anatomical markers from pediatric hand radiographs preserves clinically relevant features needed for bone age estimation and gender classification.

Method: Used RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset with 200 original radiographs, generated 600 inpainted versions using gpt-image-1 with natural language prompts targeting non-anatomical artifacts. Assessed downstream performance with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation (MAE) and gender classification (AUC), plus pixel intensity distribution analysis.

Result: Inpainting markedly degraded performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images showed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies indicating structural modifications.

Conclusion: Despite visual realism, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when editing non-diagnostic regions, requiring rigorous task-specific validation before clinical AI integration.

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Safari introduces a pose-conditioned world engine with persistent memory retrieval for generating long, 3D-consistent videos along challenging camera trajectories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on a new outdoor FPV dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world engines struggle with aggressive 6-DoF camera trajectories and complex outdoor scenes, losing geometric coherence, deviating from target paths, or producing overly conservative motion.

Method: Uses pose-conditioned world memory retrieval: maintains dynamic local memory, retrieves pose-aligned world tokens with a retriever module, and conditions video generation on these tokens to maintain 3D structure while executing challenging camera maneuvers.

Result: Substantially outperforms SOTA camera-controlled generators: reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, yields lower FVD, and wins 67.6% preferences in 50-participant human study across all evaluation axes.

Conclusion: Pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation; OpenSafari dataset provides a challenging benchmark for future world-engine research.

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

TL;DR: MMA-Bench evaluates MLLM robustness to contradicting modalities, revealing brittleness; proposes alignment tuning for stronger multimodal grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are robust to contradicting modalities, as current models may lack reliable cross-modal reasoning despite advancements.

Method: Introduces MMA-Bench with videos and tasks probing modality reliance; uses black-box and white-box interpretability techniques; proposes modality alignment tuning strategy to teach models when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle with misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, showing brittleness; alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding.

Conclusion: Provides interpretability tools and a path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning through modality alignment tuning.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceMind is a new multimodal LLM for 3D spatial reasoning from RGB images alone, using camera-guided fusion instead of auxiliary 3D data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial reasoning tasks like distance estimation and cross-view consistency. Existing methods either need extra 3D data or use shallow feature fusion with geometry encoders.

Method: Dual-encoder architecture with VGGT spatial encoder and InternViT 2D visual encoder. Key innovation: Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module treats camera representation as active guidance, applying camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens and using camera embedding to gate fused representations.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins, and SOTA on SQA3D.

Conclusion: Camera-guided modality fusion is an effective inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence, enabling strong 3D reasoning from RGB-only inputs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

TL;DR: RETINA benchmark addresses visual shortcut problem in MKB-VQA by using secondary subject queries paired with related entity images, and MIMIR model improves performance by using multiple related entity images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MKB-VQA benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts" where query images match primary subject entities, allowing models to exploit visual cues alone without proper multimodal reasoning.

Method: Introduced RETINA benchmark automatically constructed using LLM-driven pipeline with 120k training and 2k human-curated test set containing queries referencing secondary subjects paired with related entity images. Proposed MIMIR model that enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities.

Result: Existing models show significantly degraded performance on RETINA, confirming their reliance on visual shortcuts. MIMIR effectively handles RETINA challenges unlike prior single-image approaches.

Conclusion: RETINA benchmark exposes limitations of existing MKB-VQA benchmarks, and MIMIR demonstrates effectiveness in addressing visual shortcut problems through multi-image multimodal retrieval.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: SLEUTH is a multi-agent framework that improves document understanding by orchestrating retrieval and analysis agents to distill evidence-dense multimodal context from long documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on single-page tasks but struggle with long documents where clues are scattered across pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs impairs model judgment. Retrieval augmented generation helps but still contains substantial redundancy.

Method: SLEUTH is a multi-agent framework with a retriever and four collaborative agents operating in a coarse-to-fine process. It identifies key textual/visual clues in retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence (tables/charts), analyzes queries to devise reasoning strategies, and synthesizes distilled, evidence-dense multimodal context for final prediction generation.

Result: When paired with advanced VLM backbones, SLEUTH consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Ablation studies verify each module's effectiveness and confirm benefits of the hierarchical refinement paradigm.

Conclusion: SLEUTH provides a model-agnostic, scalable solution to long document understanding by addressing redundancy and scattered evidence issues through collaborative multi-agent analysis and hierarchical refinement of multimodal content.

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOW is a neural inverse rendering framework that addresses challenges in indoor scene reconstruction under co-located light-camera setups by modeling global illumination and handling strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, and specular artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes suffers from ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, especially with inter-reflections. While co-located light-camera setups help with lighting calibration, they introduce new challenges like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights that existing methods cannot handle.

Method: GLOW integrates neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination. It jointly optimizes geometry and reflectance using carefully designed regularization and initialization. The framework includes a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination conditions.

Conclusion: GLOW successfully addresses the challenges of inverse rendering in co-located light-camera setups by modeling global illumination and handling the specific artifacts introduced by such configurations, achieving superior performance in reflectance estimation.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

TL;DR: REVEAL-Bench is the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection using chain-of-evidence from expert models, and REVEAL is a forensic framework that integrates detection with expert-grounded reinforcement learning for explainable forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated images are becoming indistinguishable from authentic ones, threatening social trust and information integrity. Current explainable forensic methods rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination without verifiable evidence chains, limiting causal explanations and generalization.

Method: 1) Create REVEAL-Bench benchmark with chain-of-evidence from multiple lightweight expert models, recording step-by-step reasoning traces. 2) Develop REVEAL framework with expert-grounded reinforcement learning that jointly optimizes detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence using explicit forensic evidence.

Result: REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, establishing new state-of-the-art for explainable image forensics.

Conclusion: The proposed REVEAL framework and benchmark address critical gaps in explainable AI-generated image detection by providing verifiable evidence chains and fine-grained reasoning, advancing the field toward more trustworthy forensic analysis.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-speech gesture generation methods are limited because they omit text-driven non-spontaneous gestures and face two key challenges: 1) semantic prior gap due to lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation.

Method: 1) Novel gesture captioning framework using motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities; 2) Conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and hierarchically controlled denoiser for coordinated gesture generation.

Result: Produces high-quality gestures that are rhythmically synchronized with speech and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker pioneers gesture understanding and captioning to tackle semantic gaps in gesture generation while offering bidirectional gesture-text mapping, enabling comprehensive coordinated co-speech gesture synthesis.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: Deep learning framework uses CNNs to classify pedestrian age groups and gender from far-view intersection footage, achieving 86% accuracy without facial recognition, enabling real-time demographic monitoring for safety interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian safety in congested urban intersections, especially in low- and middle-income countries, requires better understanding of vulnerable groups. Current systems lack real-time demographic data (age/gender) that significantly influences pedestrian vulnerability, creating a gap in targeted safety interventions.

Method: Proposed deep learning framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage. Two architectures: ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet) and custom lightweight CNN. Eight model variants tested with different pooling strategies and optimizers. Data collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Classification structured as unified six-class problem (adult/teenager/child × male/female) based on full-body visual cues without facial recognition.

Result: ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved highest accuracy (86.19%). Custom lightweight CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. Both models enable real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. System provides scalable, cost-effective demographic monitoring using existing camera infrastructure.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the gap in real-time pedestrian demographic monitoring, offering a practical tool for intersection design, signal timing optimization, and targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups. It enables more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments by providing demographic insights missing in conventional traffic data.

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly.

*Kailin Lyu,Jianwei He,Long Xiao,Jianing Zeng,Liang Fan,Lin Shu,Jie Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClearGCD framework addresses prototype confusion in Generalized Category Discovery by using Semantic View Alignment and Shortcut Suppression Regularization to reduce reliance on non-semantic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes in open-world scenarios.

Method: ClearGCD uses two complementary mechanisms: 1) Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations; 2) Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones.

Result: ClearGCD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches.

Conclusion: ClearGCD effectively mitigates prototype confusion in Generalized Category Discovery by reducing reliance on non-semantic cues through complementary alignment and regularization mechanisms.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

*Silvia Zuffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel learning-based method estimates aboveground biomass from single ground-based RGB images using AGB density maps, achieving low error rates on synthetic and real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate aboveground biomass estimation is crucial for carbon storage assessment and wildfire fuel load monitoring, but traditional methods are labor-intensive or have limitations in dense vegetation. There's a need for scalable, cost-effective solutions for forest monitoring.

Method: Proposes a dense prediction approach using AGB density maps where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by plot area and image area. Uses synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset with realistic forest scenes, per-image tree attributes, and instance segmentation masks. Computes AGB via allometric equations and trains a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover scene-level AGB estimates.

Result: Achieves median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m² on held-out SPREAD synthetic data and 1.94 kg/m² on real-image dataset. First method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective forest monitoring, potentially enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives by using simple RGB images instead of specialized equipment.

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DM³T: A diffusion-based multimodal MOT framework that iteratively aligns visible and thermal infrared features through cross-modal diffusion fusion for robust autonomous driving tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal MOT integrating visible light and thermal infrared is essential for robust autonomous driving, but existing fusion methods (concatenation/addition) fail to bridge the non-linear distribution gap between heterogeneous modalities, causing modality conflicts and degraded tracking accuracy.

Method: Proposes DM³T framework with: 1) Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module for iterative feature alignment through mutual guidance, 2) plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance unified features, 3) Hierarchical Tracker for adaptive confidence estimation, unifying detection, state estimation, and data association without complex post-processing.

Result: Achieves 41.7 HOTA on VT-MOT benchmark, representing 1.54% relative improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DM³T effectively bridges the modality gap through iterative diffusion-based fusion, enabling robust multimodal tracking for autonomous driving applications with superior performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [137] [Simultaneous Image Quality Improvement and Artefacts Correction in Accelerated MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23274)
*Georgia Kanli,Daniele Perlo,Selma Boudissa,Radovan Jirik,Olivier Keunen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USArt is a deep learning model that simultaneously addresses MRI acceleration through k-space under-sampling and correction of noise/motion artifacts in brain images, achieving up to 5x acceleration without significant quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MRI acquisition is time-consuming, especially when multiple sequences are needed or patients cannot remain still. While under-sampling accelerates acquisition, it reduces image quality, and both under-sampled and full-sampled images suffer from artifacts. Existing methods address either acceleration OR artifact correction, but not both simultaneously.

Method: USArt employs a dual sub-model approach customized for 2D brain anatomical images with Cartesian sampling. It simultaneously handles under-sampling acceleration and correction of noise/motion artifacts. The model explores various under-sampling strategies, with gradient under-sampling yielding best results.

Result: The model demonstrates remarkable increase in SNR and contrast in restored images. It achieves up to 5x acceleration with simultaneous artifact correction without significant degradation. Gradient under-sampling strategy performed best among tested approaches.

Conclusion: USArt successfully addresses the gap in simultaneously handling MRI acceleration and artifact correction, showing robustness in real-world settings where both degradation factors occur together, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and patient throughput.

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

*Weiran Li,Yeqiang Liu,Yijie Wei,Mina Han,Xin Liu,Zhenbo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2C reframes multimodal prompt learning from static point representations to dynamic semantic clouds using diffusion-inspired denoising, achieving better generalization across 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal prompt learning methods are limited by optimizing single static point representations, which are brittle, prone to overfitting on base classes, and generalize poorly to novel or ambiguous categories.

Method: Points-to-Clouds (P2C) introduces a diffusion-inspired framework with dual denoising: Dynamic Prompt Denoising perturbs text prompts with annealed noise to learn smoother semantic landscapes, and an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder for robust cross-modal alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 datasets show P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving a Harmonic Mean of 79.7% on base-to-novel generalization benchmark (1.4% relative improvement over baseline).

Conclusion: Learning semantic clouds (distributions over embedding space) rather than static points enables more robust generalization in multimodal prompt learning, with P2C providing an effective diffusion-inspired framework for this paradigm shift.

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

TL;DR: Re-MeanFlow improves one-step sampling in flow-based models by modeling mean velocity along rectified trajectories with a single reflow step, outperforming prior methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flow-based models face challenges: Rectified Flow requires multiple expensive reflow iterations for straight paths, while MeanFlow suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision when trained on curved flows.

Method: Proposes Rectified MeanFlow that models the mean velocity field along rectified trajectories using only a single reflow step, eliminating need for perfectly straightened paths. Also introduces a truncation heuristic to reduce residual curvature.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Conclusion: Re-MeanFlow provides an effective framework for efficient one-step generation in flow-based models by combining rectified trajectories with mean velocity modeling, achieving better performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuMatC is a neural framework that learns low-rank continuous mappings for parametric matrix operations, achieving significant speedups over conventional methods by exploiting parameter-space continuity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional matrix operations (inversion, SVD) are performed independently for each parameter value, ignoring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along parameter dimensions, leading to redundant computations in applications like wireless communication and signal processing.

Method: Proposes Neural Matrix Computation Framework (NeuMatC) that unsupervisedly learns a low-rank continuous mapping from parameters to matrix operation results. Once trained, it enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only basic operations like matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations.

Result: Experimental results show promising performance with over 3× speedup in parametric inversion and 10× speedup in parametric SVD compared to NumPy baseline in wireless communication applications, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: NeuMatC effectively addresses the computational redundancy in parametric matrix operations by leveraging low-rankness and continuity along parameter dimensions, offering significant efficiency gains for real-world applications requiring repeated matrix computations.

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Conclusion: ReImage effectively addresses the challenge of accurate self-recovery from manipulated images through neural watermarking with shuffled watermarks, offering a practical solution for digital media authentication and restoration.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing burst denoising methods struggle with large motion or have prohibitive computational costs. The authors aim to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising while addressing challenges of applying feedforward Gaussian reconstruction to noisy inputs.

Method: Proposes DenoiseGS framework with two key innovations: 1) Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss that regularizes geometry from noisy inputs using high-quality Gaussian point clouds generated from clean inputs by the same model, and 2) log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss that adaptively weights frequency discrepancies logarithmically to preserve fine-grained details in the spectral domain.

Result: DenoiseGS significantly exceeds state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving 250× faster inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed DenoiseGS framework successfully leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient burst denoising, overcoming challenges of noisy inputs through novel GSC and LWF losses, demonstrating superior performance and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

Conclusion: One-to-All Animation provides a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and pose transfer that effectively handles spatially misaligned references, addressing a key limitation in current diffusion-based animation methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, especially under adverse conditions. Diffusion-based data generation methods show promise but introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks, which existing approaches try to fix rather than exploit.

Result: Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations.

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

*Haiyang Mei,Qiming Huang,Hai Ci,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobotSeg is a foundation model for robot segmentation in images and videos that addresses challenges in segmenting robots due to diversity, ambiguity, and complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot segmentation is crucial for robotic perception but remains challenging due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes, despite strong capabilities of modern segmentation models.

Method: Built upon SAM 2 foundation model with three key innovations: structure-enhanced memory associator for articulated robots, robot prompt generator to eliminate manual prompts, and label-efficient training strategy to reduce annotation needs. Also created VRS dataset with 2.8k videos (138k frames).

Result: RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video robot segmentation, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient foundation model for robot segmentation that successfully addresses key limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

*Shiyu Shen,Zhe Gao,Taifeng Chai,Yang Huang,Bin Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SolarCHIP introduces contrastively pretrained visual backbones for solar image analysis, addressing multimodal sensing, weak inter-class separability, and strong intra-class variability in SDO data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal translation and flare classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most deep learning approaches for solar image analysis either train task-specific encoders from scratch or use natural-image pretraining that ignores unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data, failing to address key challenges in solar imaging.

Method: SolarCHIP employs a multi-granularity contrastive pretraining framework that jointly aligns: (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs for temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices for position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure.

Result: SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet and full-disk flare classification, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited.

Conclusion: SolarCHIP provides the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

### [150] [HMR3D: Hierarchical Multimodal Representation for 3D Scene Understanding with Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22961)
*Chen Li,Eric Peh,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs using multi-view images and text descriptions with spatial coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based 3D scene understanding approaches use implicit alignment of 3D features with VLM embedding space, leading to suboptimal performance due to 3D data scarcity and spatial complexity.

Method: Hierarchical multimodal representation that explicitly aligns with VLMs using multi-view images (top-down + four directional views) and text descriptions with 3D object coordinates. Hierarchical feature aggregation from patch-level to view-level to scene-level representations.

Result: Experimental results show effectiveness on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical multimodal representation with explicit VLM alignment improves 3D scene reasoning by better capturing spatial relationships and comprehensive scene coverage.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

### [151] [Taming the Light: Illumination-Invariant Semantic 3DGS-SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22968)
*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Yurong Qian,Zhenhong Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic SLAM framework with illumination invariance using proactive intrinsic appearance normalization and reactive dynamic radiance balancing loss for extreme exposure conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme exposure conditions degrade both 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly harmful to tightly-coupled SLAM systems that need illumination invariance for robust performance.

Method: Two key designs: 1) Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module that proactively disentangles scene's intrinsic properties (albedo) from transient lighting to create illumination-invariant appearance model; 2) Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) that reactively handles extreme exposure frames by activating only when exposure is poor and operating directly on the radiance field for targeted optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on public datasets in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy, demonstrating unprecedented robustness to extreme lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The synergy between proactive invariance (IAN) and reactive correction (DRB-Loss) creates a semantic SLAM framework with exceptional robustness to extreme exposure, enabling reliable performance across varying lighting conditions without compromising normal-condition performance.

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BlockVid is a novel block diffusion framework that addresses challenges in minute-long video generation by introducing semantic-aware sparse KV cache, Block Forcing training strategy, and chunk-wise noise scheduling to reduce error accumulation and improve temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) video generation methods face two main challenges: KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks with coherence-aware metrics for evaluating minute-long video generation.

Method: Proposes BlockVid framework with: 1) semantic-aware sparse KV cache to reduce error propagation, 2) Block Forcing training strategy, 3) chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling for better temporal consistency. Also introduces LV-Bench benchmark with new metrics for evaluating long-range coherence.

Result: BlockVid outperforms existing methods on both VBench and LV-Bench, achieving 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: BlockVid effectively addresses key challenges in minute-long video generation, demonstrating superior performance in generating high-quality, coherent extended videos through its novel architectural and training innovations.

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

*Qiushi Yang,Yingjie Chen,Yuan Yao,Yifang Men,Huaizhuo Liu,Miaomiao Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: McSc is a three-stage RL framework for aligning text-to-video generation with human preferences, addressing conflicts between motion dynamics and visual quality through self-critic reasoning and motion-corrective optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2V preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or proxy metrics that lack understanding of human preference logic, and they often ignore conflicts between dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, potentially biasing models toward low-motion content.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments using self-critic reasoning chains; 2) Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) enables structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision; 3) Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) optimizes T2V models using RM-preferred videos while dynamically re-weighting alignment objectives to mitigate low-motion bias.

Result: McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamics, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing the motion-quality conflict.

Conclusion: The proposed McSc framework provides a robust solution for aligning T2V generation with nuanced human preferences by decomposing preferences into dimensions, using hierarchical reasoning, and correcting motion bias, enabling generation of high-quality, dynamic videos.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

*Hong Zheng,Nan Mu,Han Su,Lin Feng,Xiaoning Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF) - a low-amplitude pass filter to reduce noise in convolutional features for segmentation networks, validated on cardiac MR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise reduction is crucial in DSP but often neglected in convolutional feature processing for segmentation networks, potentially causing butterfly effects that impair downstream results in the feature system.

Method: Treats convolutional features as Gaussian-distributed feature signal matrices and introduces CFF - a simple low-amplitude pass filter to minimize noise. Also develops a binarization equation to calculate information entropy for numerical analysis of noise reduction.

Result: Experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets validated CFF effectiveness, demonstrating decreased noise in feature signal matrices.

Conclusion: CFF provides an effective solution for noise reduction in convolutional features, addressing a previously overlooked aspect in segmentation networks that could have cascading negative effects on overall system performance.

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiBanana is a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate text-to-image models' capabilities in multi-reference generation and editing, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by covering diverse multi-reference-specific challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmark datasets for text-to-image generation focus on single or few reference images, preventing proper evaluation of multi-reference generation capabilities. Current benchmarks have vague task definitions and fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings.

Method: The authors introduce MultiBanana, a carefully designed benchmark that assesses model capabilities by covering five key multi-reference-specific problems: varying number of references, domain mismatch among references, scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, references containing rare concepts, and multilingual textual references for rendering.

Result: Analysis of various text-to-image models using MultiBanana reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of multi-reference generation capabilities.

Conclusion: MultiBanana addresses the gap in multi-reference evaluation for text-to-image models and will be released as an open benchmark to push boundaries and establish standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/matsuolab/multibanana .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive models that enables high-quality unconditional generation and maintains strong prompt alignment for conditional generation without retraining or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has been successful for diffusion models but remains tied to diffusion-specific assumptions. The authors aim to develop a guidance mechanism for visual autoregressive models that doesn't require retraining, specific conditions, or architectural modifications.

Method: Proposes a spectrum-weakening framework that constructs a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. Uses invertible spectral transformations that preserve information while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum for controlled information reduction. Performs spectrum selection along channel dimension of internal representations and introduces two spectrum renormalization strategies for numerical stability.

Result: Extensive experiments on both discrete and continuous AR models with text or class conditioning demonstrate that the method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

Conclusion: The proposed spectrum-weakening framework successfully adapts guidance mechanisms to visual autoregressive models, overcoming diffusion-specific assumptions and enabling effective unconditional and conditional generation without architectural changes or retraining.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

*Minseong Kweon,Janghyun Kim,Ukcheol Shin,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MrGS is a multi-modal radiance field based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes by incorporating physics-based thermal modeling principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF and 3DGS approaches focus on RGB reconstruction but neglect thermal infrared imagery and its distinctive characteristics like heat conduction and Lambertian properties, leaving multi-modal rendering underexplored.

Method: MrGS extracts RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature via orthogonal feature extraction, uses modality-specific embedding strategies, and incorporates two physics principles: Fourier's law of heat conduction for thermal interpolation and Stefan-Boltzmann/inverse-square laws for depth-aware thermal radiation mapping.

Result: Experimental results show MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians needed compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MrGS framework successfully integrates thermal physics into 3DGS, enabling effective multi-modal RGB-T scene reconstruction with improved efficiency and fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent-based editing models face two critical challenges: (1) instruction hallucination where text-only reasoning leads to factual errors due to information bottlenecks, and (2) reward hacking where agents exploit flaws in static reward functions during dynamic policy optimization.

Method: JarvisEvo emulates expert human designers with iterative editing, tool selection, evaluation, and reflection. It features: (1) interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning for better instruction following, (2) synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) for self-improvement without external rewards, and (3) integration with Adobe Lightroom for global and local fine-grained editing.

Result: On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, with a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo successfully addresses key challenges in agent-based editing through multimodal reasoning and self-improvement optimization, demonstrating significant improvements in editing quality and content preservation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GC-4DGS improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view rendering by incorporating geometric consistency through dynamic consistency checking and global-local depth regularization, achieving better quality than existing methods while maintaining real-time performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods degrade significantly with sparse input views due to incoherent 4D geometry learning, limiting practical AIoT applications like digital twins where only limited views are available.

Method: Introduces GC-4DGS framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4DGS: 1) dynamic consistency checking to reduce MVS estimation uncertainties across spacetime, and 2) global-local depth regularization to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths.

Result: Outperforms RF-DeRF (latest dynamic radiance field for sparse-input synthesis) by 2.62dB and original 4DGS by 1.58dB in PSNR on N3DV and Technicolor datasets, while maintaining real-time rendering and deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Conclusion: GC-4DGS successfully addresses sparse-view limitations in dynamic Gaussian Splatting through geometric consistency infusion, enabling high-quality real-time dynamic scene rendering from sparse inputs for practical AIoT applications.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

*Hyunjin Kim,Kunho Kim,Adam Lee,Wonkwang Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex is a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces using occlusion-aware layering and visibility control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D texturing methods perform well on visible regions but lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. There's a need for a method that can texture both exterior and interior surfaces seamlessly.

Method: The method introduces an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on hit levels from multi-view ray casting, partitioning mesh faces into ordered visibility layers. It uses a two-stage visibility control strategy: first progressively revealing interior regions with structural coherence, then texturing each layer with a pretrained diffusion model. A soft UV-space blending technique merges textures across layers based on view-dependent visibility confidence.

Result: GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. It operates without costly fine-tuning of pretrained diffusion models and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior regions.

Conclusion: GOATex successfully addresses the limitation of existing methods by providing a complete texturing solution for both exterior and interior mesh surfaces through occlusion-aware layering and visibility control, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances without model fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

*Grigorios Aris Cheimariotis,Antonis Karakottas,Vangelis Chatzis,Angelos Kanlis,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to quantify individual image contributions to NeRF-based 3D reconstructions, assessing which images are most valuable for photorealistic scene reconstruction from in-the-wild image sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-the-wild scenes for 3D reconstruction often contain images of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, leading to uneven utility across inputs. As data valuation becomes increasingly important in domains like XR and digital media, there's a need to quantify which images contribute most to reconstruction quality.

Method: The authors propose a method to quantify individual image contributions to NeRF-based reconstructions using reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and MSE (Mean Squared Error). They validate their approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Result: The method successfully identifies images with varying contributions to reconstruction quality. Validation shows that removing low-contributing images during training allows measurement of their impact on reconstruction fidelity, demonstrating the practical utility of the contribution assessment approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a valuable tool for data valuation in 3D scene reconstruction, enabling identification of high-value images for NeRF-based reconstructions. This has important implications for data monetization, efficient training, and quality optimization in applications like XR and digital media.

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

*Hongye Zhu,Xuan Liu,Yanwen Ba,Jingye Xue,Shigeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REP (REplay Prompting) is a lightweight method that caches early-layer features and replays them in deeper layers to improve multimodal model robustness when modalities are missing, outperforming prior methods with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for handling missing modalities either use computationally expensive synthesis or rely only on adjacent-layer features, overlooking long-distance contextual information that could provide better error tolerance when modalities are missing.

Method: REP constructs modality-wise feature buffers via residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers. It employs private-shared feature decoupling (private buffers for modality-specific signals, shared buffers for cross-modal semantics) and uses task-aware dynamic initialization to configure buffers differently for improved stability and generalization.

Result: Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks show REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead.

Conclusion: REP establishes a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments, addressing information loss in deep networks and improving tolerance to missing modalities.

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

TL;DR: ENSEL is an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system that improves diagnostic accuracy for atopic dermatitis by integrating multiple deep learning models, achieving high recall and fast processing speeds using real-world clinical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital healthcare growth in South Korea, need for objective diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (currently subjective and prone to misdiagnosis), similarity to psoriasis, lack of high-quality dermoscopic images in clinical settings, and need for accurate and fast response systems.

Method: Proposed ENSEL system using ensemble learning approach that integrates various deep learning models to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Performance verified using actual user-taken skin lesion images with random sampling for accuracy and response time measurements.

Result: ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and processing speed of less than 1 second. Demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy for skin lesions using real-world clinical images.

Conclusion: ENSEL contributes to objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes advancement of digital healthcare by providing accurate and fast diagnostic support for conditions like atopic dermatitis using ensemble learning with real clinical images.

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

TL;DR: NumeriKontrol enables precise image editing by allowing users to control edit intensity with continuous numeric values, addressing the limitation of text-only instructions lacking fine-grained control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text instructions for image editing often lack precision for fine-grained control over edit intensity, making it difficult to achieve exact attribute adjustments.

Method: Uses a Numeric Adapter to encode numeric editing scales, injects them into diffusion models in plug-and-play manner, employs task-separated design for zero-shot multi-condition editing, and trains on high-quality synthesized data from rendering engines and DSLR cameras.

Result: NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across diverse attribute editing scenarios, functioning as a powerful interactive editing studio.

Conclusion: The framework advances instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation through numeric control.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MathSight benchmark reveals VLMs rely more on linguistic priors than visual understanding for math reasoning, with visual contribution decreasing as problems get harder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how much visual information truly contributes to multimodal mathematical reasoning in Vision-Language Models, as existing benchmarks don't isolate the role of images and may overestimate visual understanding.

Method: Created MathSight, a university-level multimodal math reasoning benchmark with controlled visual variants (original, hand-drawn, photo-captured) and text-only conditions to disentangle visual input effects.

Result: VLMs show consistent trend: visual contribution diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Qwen3-VL without images outperforms both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, indicating reliance on linguistic priors.

Conclusion: Current VLMs don't genuinely leverage visual understanding for math reasoning; benchmarks like MathSight are needed to advance true vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

*Siqi Chen,Ke Hong,Tianchen Zhao,Ruiqi Xie,Zhenhua Zhu,Xudong Zhang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: db-SP is a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that addresses workload imbalance in Diffusion Transformer inference by using dual-level partitioning and dynamic parallel degree determination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence parallelism methods for Diffusion Transformers suffer from severe workload imbalance when applied to models with block-wise sparse attention, due to varying sparsity across attention heads and irregular distribution of dense blocks within sparse masks.

Method: Proposes db-SP with: 1) formalization of sparse imbalance ratio to quantify imbalance, 2) dual-level partitioning approach for near-perfect workload balance at head and block levels, and 3) dynamic determination of parallel degrees for head and block dimensions at runtime to handle evolving sparsity patterns.

Result: db-SP achieves 1.25x end-to-end speedup and 1.40x attention-specific speedup over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Conclusion: db-SP effectively addresses workload imbalance in sparse attention models, enabling efficient scaling of Diffusion Transformer inference through sparsity-aware sequence parallelism with dynamic adaptation to changing sparsity patterns.

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

*Zibo Zhou,Zhengjun Zhai,Huimin Chen,Wei Dai,Hansen Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACIEC uses affective captioning and language models to bridge the affective gap in image emotion classification by converting images to emotional text descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual models struggle with the "affective gap" in image emotion classification, while psychology shows language can effectively capture and express emotional information, motivating a text-based approach.

Method: Uses hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss for emotional concept detection, emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning for affective sentence generation, and pre-trained language models to synthesize emotional concepts and sentences for classification. Also includes semantic similarity sampling contrastive loss and handles images with embedded text.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively bridges the affective gap and achieves superior performance on multiple benchmarks compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The ACIEC framework successfully leverages language's expressive power to overcome affective gap limitations in image emotion classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based approaches for capturing emotional information from images.

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: DNA-Prior is a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean medical images from corrupted data using a hybrid prior combining implicit architectural and explicit spectral-spatial priors, without requiring training data or modality-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image denoisers rely on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, limiting usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data.

Method: DNA-Prior integrates (1) an implicit architectural prior enforced through deep network parameterization with (2) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of frequency-domain fidelity term and spatial regularization functional, forming a dual-domain optimization problem.

Result: Experiments across multiple modalities show DNA-Prior achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Conclusion: DNA-Prior provides a mathematically principled, unsupervised denoising framework that works across modalities without external training data, addressing limitations of supervised approaches in clinical settings.

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

TL;DR: DualCamCtrl is an end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation that uses a dual-branch framework to generate RGB and depth sequences with better scene understanding and geometric awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation methods using ray-based camera pose representations often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness, limiting their ability to faithfully follow specified camera trajectories.

Method: Introduces a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences, with a Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism for semantics-guided RGB-depth fusion, enabling better disentanglement of appearance and geometry modeling.

Result: Achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation with over 40% reduction in camera motion errors compared to prior methods, and reveals distinct influence patterns of depth and camera poses across denoising stages.

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl demonstrates superior performance in camera-controlled video generation by better understanding scene geometry through its dual-branch approach and SIGMA mechanism, with early and late denoising stages playing complementary roles in structure formation and detail refinement.

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video models lack fine-grained controllability over video generation, particularly at the instance level, and struggle with maintaining global semantic consistency while controlling specific instances.

Method: Proposes InstanceV with: 1) Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention for utilizing instance-level grounding information, 2) Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement for connecting local instances with global semantics, and 3) Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance to prevent disappearance of small instances.

Result: InstanceV achieves remarkable instance-level controllability and outperforms state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed InstanceV framework successfully addresses the challenge of fine-grained instance-level control in video generation while maintaining global semantic consistency, as demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on the new InstanceBench benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

TL;DR: A multi-stage document rectification framework that progressively corrects perspective, geometric, and content distortions in a coarse-to-fine manner, achieving state-of-the-art performance with new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world document rectification faces challenges from extreme camera perspective variations and physical distortions; existing methods struggle with complex transformations and evaluation protocols have limitations.

Method: Three-stage progressive framework: 1) global affine transformation for perspective correction, 2) geometric deformation rectification for paper curling/folding, 3) content-aware iterative process for fine-grained content distortions.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks with 14.1%-34.7% reduction in AAD metric; demonstrates superior efficacy in real-world applications; introduces enhanced evaluation metrics (AED/ACER and AD-M/AAD-M).

Conclusion: The progressive multi-stage approach effectively handles complex document distortions by decomposing transformations; proposed metrics provide more accurate evaluation; framework shows strong practical performance with code availability.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications.

TL;DR: RA-RFT method improves Video Temporal Grounding by teaching models to refuse hard-irrelevant queries using reinforcement fine-tuning with multiple reward objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG models always predict segments even for irrelevant queries, and current approaches fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant to the video.

Method: Proposes Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, integrating four reward objectives: format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction. Also constructs Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. Shows scalability by applying to various LVLM-based VTG models.

Conclusion: RA-RFT effectively addresses the limitation of existing VTG models by enabling them to refuse hard-irrelevant queries through reinforcement fine-tuning with comprehensive reward objectives and specialized dataset support.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

TL;DR: PowerCLIP introduces powerset alignment for contrastive vision-language pre-training, using efficient non-linear aggregators to handle combinatorial complexity and improve compositional understanding across multiple image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive vision-language models like CLIP struggle to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions, as they typically align individual text tokens with specific image patches rather than handling complex region-to-phrase relationships.

Method: Proposes PowerCLIP with powerset alignment that optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing loss between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Introduces efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) to reduce computational complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) while maintaining accuracy.

Result: PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, demonstrating improved compositionality and robustness compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The powerset alignment framework with efficient NLAs effectively addresses the challenge of capturing multi-region compositional semantics in vision-language pre-training, leading to superior zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

*Liyi Chen,Ruihuang Li,Guowen Zhang,Pengfei Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP3DE uses pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass, bypassing iterative 2D-3D-2D updates by conditioning on a single edited view to generate other consistent views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven 3D editing methods are time-consuming and produce over-smoothed results due to iterative 2D-3D-2D updates that average different editing signals from different views during the process.

Method: Proposes generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) that leverages temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models. Conditions video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for direct 3D updating. Introduces motion-preserved noise blending for generating edited views at predefined camera poses and geometry-aware denoising to enhance multi-view consistency using 3D geometric priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show ViP3DE achieves high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Conclusion: ViP3DE successfully addresses the limitations of iterative 3D editing methods by leveraging video generation priors for efficient, high-quality multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

TL;DR: GeoWorld improves image-to-3D scene generation by using geometry models with video frames instead of single-frame inputs, achieving better geometric accuracy and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video-based image-to-3D generation methods suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by better leveraging geometric information.

Method: 1) Generate consecutive video frames first, 2) Use geometry models to extract full-frame geometry features (richer than single-frame depth maps), 3) Use geometry features as conditions for video generation, 4) Add geometry alignment loss for real-world constraints, 5) Implement geometry adaptation module for effective feature utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments show GeoWorld generates high-fidelity 3D scenes from single images and camera trajectories, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: GeoWorld successfully renovates image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking geometry model potential, achieving superior geometric consistency and visual quality compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large pathology foundation models with billions of parameters produce high-dimensional embeddings that limit practical deployment when computing resources are constrained, creating barriers for broader research and clinical adoption.

Method: Pathryoshka combines RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning in a multi-teacher distillation framework to compress pathology foundation models while preserving adaptable embedding dimensions.

Result: The distilled model achieves on-par performance with much larger teachers while reducing model size by 86-92%, and outperforms comparable single-teacher distillation models by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy across ten pathology benchmarks.

Conclusion: Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology foundation models by enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, benefiting the broader research and clinical community.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

TL;DR: A zero-shot quality inspection framework using real-time Digital Twins for defect detection in semi-controlled industrial environments, achieving up to 63.3% IoU scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-stage visual quality inspection is crucial for Zero-Defect Manufacturing, but current systems are complex and data-hungry, limiting adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings.

Method: Pose-agnostic, zero-shot framework comparing real scenes against real-time Digital Twins in RGB-D space using object detection and pose estimation of CAD models, with hierarchical annotation for multi-criteria defect detection.

Result: Achieved up to 63.3% intersection-over-union (IoU) scores compared to ground-truth masks using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions in an automotive use case.

Conclusion: The framework provides groundwork for generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings, enabling efficient quality inspection with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular instruction tuning focuses on question-answering and reasoning, neglecting tabular data generation. The research addresses the challenge of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources.

Method: Created a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, then instruction-tuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on only 7K instructions using an A100 GPU for less than 6 hours.

Result: Achieved tabular data generation performance on par with GPT-4o, demonstrating that effective instruction tuning is possible with limited resources.

Conclusion: Instruction tuning with limited data and computation can significantly improve LLMs' tabular data generation capabilities, making it accessible without extensive resources.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

### [180] [Robust 3DGS-based SLAM via Adaptive Kernel Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23221)
*Shouhe Zhang,Dayong Ren,Sensen Song,Wenjie Li,Piaopiao Yu,Yurong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the conventional wisdom in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy, proposing instead to enhance rasterization robustness against parameter errors using a smooth kernel strategy called CB-KNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that in 3DGS-SLAM, focusing solely on perfect scene representation is less important than making the rasterization process more robust to parameter errors for stable camera pose tracking. They challenge the conventional notion that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy.

Method: Proposes Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), a novel approach that uses a smooth kernel strategy to enhance rasterization robustness. Instead of minimizing rendering error, it makes rasterization more resilient to 3DGS parameter imperfections by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider pixel distribution. This introduces controlled blur as regularization. CB-KNN adaptively modifies RGB values and locations of K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within local regions to generate smoother local rendering.

Result: Experimental results show the approach significantly improves robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking while maintaining overall scene reconstruction (mapping) quality.

Conclusion: Enhancing rasterization robustness against parameter errors is more critical than pursuing perfect scene representation for stable camera pose tracking in 3DGS-SLAM. The proposed CB-KNN method provides a practical solution that improves tracking performance without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations is challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves, leading to missed detections and false positives in existing detectors.

Method: Three key improvements: (1) Dual-Attention Fusion Module combining convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention global context modeling; (2) occlusion-aware detection head learning relationships between visible and occluded parts; (3) C2f-DSConv module using dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes.

Conclusion: DAONet-YOLOv8 effectively addresses challenges in tea plantation pest/disease detection through attention mechanisms, occlusion handling, and adaptive feature extraction, achieving superior performance over mainstream detection models.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

*Lihan Li,Haofeng Zhong,Rui Bu,Mingchao Sun,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen,Yangyan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointCNN++ is a novel 3D point cloud convolution method that generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points, eliminating the precision-performance trade-off between point-based and voxel-based methods through native point operations and optimized GPU kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D point cloud learning methods face a fundamental trade-off: point-based methods preserve geometric precision but suffer performance issues, while voxel-based methods achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This precision loss is particularly problematic for tasks like point cloud registration.

Method: PointCNN++ introduces point-centric convolution with receptive fields centered on original high-precision point coordinates. It formulates convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem and implements a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel for efficient computation.

Result: PointCNN++ uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster than representative point-based methods. When replacing voxel-based backbones, it significantly improves point cloud registration accuracy while being both more memory-efficient and faster.

Conclusion: PointCNN++ demonstrates that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, enabling a new class of 3D learning with both high fidelity and efficiency, fundamentally changing the precision-performance trade-off paradigm.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

Motivation: 3D functionality understanding tasks suffer from real-world data scarcity due to high collection and annotation costs, creating a need for scalable synthetic data generation methods.

Method: SynthFun3D uses furniture asset databases with part-level annotations to generate 3D indoor environments from action descriptions, automatically identifying and retrieving 3D masks of functional elements.

Result: User studies show improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches, and quantitative results demonstrate synthetic data can replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement it for improved performance.

Conclusion: SynthFun3D provides an inexpensive, scalable solution for generating high-quality annotated 3D data, addressing data scarcity in 3D functionality understanding applications.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

TL;DR: MRRE is a training-free inference-time method that enhances multilingual reasoning in LLMs/LVLMs by injecting precomputed vectors to steer non-English reasoning toward English space while preserving target language consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs/LVLMs show strong reasoning capabilities but perform significantly better in English than low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns. Existing multilingual training or translation-based approaches are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality.

Method: MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors during inference: 1) cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors that steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space, and 2) target-language output anchoring vectors that restore target language distribution to preserve input-output consistency.

Result: Experiments across six LLMs/LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks show MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by average 5.48% gain (up to 7.54% in low-resource languages like Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

Conclusion: MRRE provides an effective training-free solution to enhance multilingual reasoning capabilities without additional data or tools, addressing fairness concerns in multilingual applications while maintaining language consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

Motivation: Reduce data generation and annotation burden for cost-effective ML deployment in industrial/robotics settings by evaluating synthetic data creation methods without manual annotation.

Method: Benchmarked domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques including feature-based methods, generative AI, and classical rendering approaches. Evaluated low-level/high-level feature alignment and controlled diffusion-based DA with context prompts. Tested on proprietary industrial dataset (automotive/logistics) and public robotics dataset.

Result: Simpler feature-based methods outperform GenAI in accuracy and resource efficiency when sufficient variable render-based seed data exists. Perceptual hashing achieved best performance: 98% mAP50 on industrial dataset, 67% on robotics dataset. GenAI methods showed significant time overhead without improving sim-to-real mAP values.

Conclusion: Feature-based methods like perceptual hashing are most effective for bridging sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from synthetic-only training with better efficiency than complex GenAI approaches.

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color correction algorithms inspired by human vision are difficult to characterize in terms of image features like contrast and dispersion. The authors aim to create a more principled, perceptually-inspired approach with better theoretical understanding.

Method: Develop a variational formulation with specific perceptual requirements, identify functionals satisfying these requirements, compute minima using gradient descent, and propose computational optimization from O(N²) to O(N log N).

Result: Three explicit functionals of basic interest are identified, showing similarities and differences with existing models. A general methodology reduces computational cost significantly.

Conclusion: The proposed variational approach provides a principled, perceptually-inspired framework for color contrast enhancement with improved computational efficiency and better theoretical characterization.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: Markov-VAR reformulates visual autoregressive modeling as a non-full-context Markov process using sliding window compression to improve efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full-context dependency in VAR models causes computational inefficiency and high overhead, hindering practicality and scalability despite better representation learning.

Method: Reformulates VAR as Markov process with Markovian Scale Prediction: treats each scale as Markov state, uses sliding window to compress previous scales into compact history vector, combines with current state to create dynamic state evolving under Markov process.

Result: Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% on ImageNet 256×256 and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% on 1024×1024 compared to original VAR.

Conclusion: Markov-VAR is simple yet effective, offering better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency, serving as foundation for future visual autoregressive generation research.

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

TL;DR: Computer vision pipeline using YOLOv11 and PaddleOCR to digitize vital sign data from bedside monitor screens in low-resource healthcare settings, achieving over 98.9% extraction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource healthcare settings have standalone bedside monitors without network connectivity, creating interoperability gaps that prevent integration of physiological data into EHR systems. Costly hardware replacement is not feasible.

Method: Hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for monitor and ROI localization with PaddleOCR for text extraction. Includes geometric rectification module to standardize screen perspective across variable camera angles and lighting conditions.

Result: Evaluated on 6,498 images from open-source corpora and real-world ICUs in Vietnam.

Conclusion: Lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured screen data into structured digital data, providing practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings without costly hardware upgrades.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world driving data lacks diversity in safety-critical and out-of-distribution scenarios needed for fully autonomous driving systems, requiring a scalable solution to generate diverse training data.

Method: Uses neural rendering with reactive environments to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations from perturbed ego trajectories, plus pseudo-expert trajectory generation for action supervision, enabling co-training on both real and simulated data.

Result: Significant improvements in robustness and generalization for planning methods: +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest benchmarks, with scaling benefits from simulation data alone without extra real-world data.

Conclusion: SimScale provides an effective framework for generating diverse driving scenarios, revealing crucial design insights about pseudo-experts and scaling properties, with promising results for autonomous driving policy improvement.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEAL-300K is a large-scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization, featuring 300K+ annotated images created using AI-generated editing instructions, mask-free diffusion editing, and active-learning annotation. The paper also proposes a localization framework using frozen visual foundation models with multi-frequency prompt tuning.


<details>

Motivation: Current benchmarks don't adequately address diffusion-based image editing localization, which creates smooth, realistic forgeries that are hard to detect. Existing methods focus on binary detection or manual editing localization, missing the unique challenges of diffusion-based edits.

Method: Created DEAL-300K dataset using: 1) multi-modal LLM for editing instructions, 2) mask-free diffusion editor for manipulated images, 3) active-learning change detection for pixel-level annotations. Proposed localization framework uses frozen Visual Foundation Model with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning to capture semantic and frequency-domain cues.

Result: Achieved pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on DEAL-300K test split and 80.97% on external CoCoGlide benchmark. The dataset provides strong baselines for diffusion-based image manipulation localization research.

Conclusion: DEAL-300K addresses the gap in localization benchmarks for diffusion-based image edits and provides a practical foundation for future research in detecting and localizing AI-generated image manipulations.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

TL;DR: VQRAE is a unified tokenizer that produces continuous semantic features for image understanding and discrete tokens for visual generation using vector quantization autoencoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches use separate encoders for understanding and generation, creating fragmentation. The paper aims to unify multimodal understanding, generation, and reconstruction within a single tokenizer.

Method: VQRAE builds on pretrained vision foundation models with symmetric ViT decoder. Uses two-stage training: 1) freeze encoder, learn high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction; 2) jointly optimize encoder with self-distillation constraints.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on visual understanding, generation, and reconstruction benchmarks. Semantic VQ codebook achieves 100% utilization ratio at dimension 1536. Shows promising scaling properties for autoregressive generation.

Conclusion: VQRAE successfully unifies continuous semantic features for understanding and discrete tokens for generation within a single tokenizer, addressing a key challenge in building unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater tracking is challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering that distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations.

Conclusion: The physics-informed framework MANTA effectively addresses underwater tracking challenges by integrating representation learning with tracking design, demonstrating superior performance and generalization across diverse underwater conditions.

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

TL;DR: DisMo learns abstract motion representations from raw video data via image-space reconstruction, enabling open-world motion transfer across semantically unrelated entities without object correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video and image-to-video models lack explicit motion representations separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators who need motion transfer capabilities.

Method: Proposes DisMo paradigm that learns generic motion representations independent of static information via image-space reconstruction objective. Uses lightweight adapters to combine with existing video generators.

Result: Enables accurate motion transfer across vastly different categories without trading off motion fidelity and prompt adherence. Outperforms V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on Something-Something v2 and Jester benchmarks.

Conclusion: DisMo provides a novel motion representation that disentangles motion from appearance, enabling open-world motion transfer and showing strong performance on downstream motion understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Motivation: Current generative world models are limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. There's a need for more flexible, semantically rich interaction within generated game worlds.

Method: The approach involves: 1) Formal definition of interactive video data concept, 2) Automated process to transform unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets, 3) Building on a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts foundation model, 4) Incorporating text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics.

Result: The model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions (e.g., "open the door", "draw a torch", "trigger an explosion"). An interaction-focused benchmark called InterBench was introduced for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2 represents a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction through natural language, keyboard, or mouse signals, overcoming limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Result: The methods demonstrate significant performance boosts in the data-constrained experimental setting, enabling models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data.

Conclusion: Data synthesis methods using object-centric data can effectively extend object detection models to novel categories with limited training data, addressing the challenge of costly annotation for long-tailed classes.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

TL;DR: VGT (Visual Generation Tuning) is a novel method that unlocks visual generation capabilities in existing Vision Language Models through efficient tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results in image reconstruction and generation tasks with 20x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs excel at multimodal understanding through extensive pretraining, it's unclear whether their visual representations contain inherent potential for visual generation. The paper aims to explore and unlock this latent capability without the high alignment costs of traditional approaches.

Method: VGT proposes efficient visual generation tuning on pretrained VLMs by aligning semantic encoders from VLMs with latent representations of pixel decoders, replacing entangled pixel-level VAEs. This creates VGT-AE for autoregressive modeling in continuous space with significantly reduced convergence time.

Result: Achieves 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at 28x compression ratio in reconstruction (outperforming specialized VAEs), and state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models: 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Shows 20x speedup in convergence.

Conclusion: VGT demonstrates that VLMs' visual representations can be efficiently tuned for high-quality visual generation, offering a new pathway for unified multimodal foundation models that combine understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: AnyTalker effectively addresses challenges in multi-person video generation by providing scalable identity processing with reduced data requirements while maintaining high-quality synchronization and interactivity.

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

TL;DR: Video CoM introduces interactive video reasoning where models actively manipulate videos through iterative visual actions, improving fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding with fewer training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs treat video as static context, creating semantic bottlenecks where models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding.

Method: Proposes Interactive Video Reasoning with Video CoM model using Chain of Manipulations (CoM) for iterative visual actions. Creates Video CoM Instruct dataset (18K samples) and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with step-level reasoning rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 3.6% average improvement over SOTA across nine video reasoning benchmarks while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO samples (significantly fewer than comparable models). Reasoning-aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: Interactive Video Reasoning transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos" through iterative visual manipulations, overcoming limitations of passive video understanding paradigms.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Result: Video R2 achieves higher Think Answer Consistency (TAC), Video Attention Score (VAS), and accuracy across 11 video reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and reasoning coherence.

Conclusion: Improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding, with the model, code, and dataset being open-sourced.

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

Conclusion: JELV provides a scalable solution for enhancing reference diversity and strengthening both evaluation and model generalization in grammatical error correction systems.

Abstract: Existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems suffer from limited reference diversity, leading to underestimated evaluation and restricted model generalization. To address this issue, we introduce the Judge of Edit-Level Validity (JELV), an automated framework to validate correction edits from grammaticality, faithfulness, and fluency. Using our proposed human-annotated Pair-wise Edit-level Validity Dataset (PEVData) as benchmark, JELV offers two implementations: a multi-turn LLM-as-Judges pipeline achieving 90% agreement with human annotators, and a distilled DeBERTa classifier with 85% precision on valid edits. We then apply JELV to reclassify misjudged false positives in evaluation and derive a comprehensive evaluation metric by integrating false positive decoupling and fluency scoring, resulting in state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. We also apply JELV to filter LLM-generated correction candidates, expanding the BEA19's single-reference dataset containing 38,692 source sentences. Retraining top GEC systems on this expanded dataset yields measurable performance gains. JELV provides a scalable solution for enhancing reference diversity and strengthening both evaluation and model generalization.

### [206] [Evaluating Embedding Generalization: How LLMs, LoRA, and SLERP Shape Representational Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21703)
*Siyaxolisa Kabane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based text embeddings better capture compositional patterns but suffer from adapter dominance; SLERP merging recovers base-model structure while retaining task gains, offering superior clustering performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate generalization properties of dense text embeddings when using LLM vs non-LLM backbones, and study how spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) model-merging mitigates over-specialization from task-specific adaptation like LoRA.

Method: Designed controlled experiments with numerical sequences to evaluate clustering/classification of number-theoretic properties. Compared four model families: non-LLM encoders, LLM-based encoders with LoRA, LoRA-adapted LLMs with model souping, and LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP. Evaluated with clustering indices (Silhouette, Davies Bouldin) and analyzed kmeans labels.

Result: LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization. SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability and robustness compared to model souping or unmerged models.

Conclusion: SLERP merging effectively mitigates over-specialization from task adaptation, offering a superior approach for maintaining base-model generalization while incorporating task-specific improvements in embedding quality.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization properties of dense text embeddings when the embedding backbone is a large language model (LLM) versus when it is a non-LLM encoder, and we study the extent to which spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) model-merging mitigates over-specialization introduced by task-specific adaptation (e.g., LoRA). To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.

### [207] [On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Pre-trained wav2vec2-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21704)
*Jonatas Grosman,Cassio Almeida,Guilherme Schardong,Hélio Lopes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigates cross-lingual transferability of wav2vec2-based models for speech recognition across 18 languages using 15 pre-trained models, finding data diversity matters more than size, and Indo-European languages perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While wav2vec 2.0 models achieve SOTA results, few studies examine how their transfer knowledge behaves across different languages, especially when target languages differ from pre-training languages. Need to understand cross-lingual transferability for better model utilization.

Method: Conducted fine-tuning experiments on speech recognition task across 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained wav2vec2-based models. Analyzed performance patterns across language families and pre-training data characteristics.

Result: Data diversity in pre-training matters more than data size for final performance. Indo-European languages outperform non-Indo-European languages. Positive cross-lingual transfer observed with monolingual models, stronger when pre-training and target languages are similar.

Conclusion: Provides insights for scientific community on utilizing existing wav2vec2-based models and facilitating new pre-training. Cross-lingual transfer works best with linguistically similar languages, and data diversity is crucial for model performance.

Abstract: Using representations provided by a large pre-trained model has become the primary strategy for achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones.

### [208] [Insight-A: Attribution-aware for Multimodal Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21705)
*Junjie Wu,Yumeng Fu,Chen Gong,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Insight-A is a framework that uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with attribution analysis to detect AI-generated multimodal misinformation by identifying forgery sources and cross-modal distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated content (AIGC) creates sophisticated multimodal misinformation on social media, posing societal threats. Current methods using MLLMs ignore misinformation attribution, failing to trace forgery sources and patterns.

Method: Insight-A uses: 1) Cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model correlations between perception and reasoning for attributing misinformation to forgery traces; 2) Automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) to reduce human annotation bias; 3) Image captioning (IC) for visual detail extraction; 4) Hierarchical reasoning pipeline to detect distortions across modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate Insight-A's superiority over standard approaches, providing a new paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection in the AIGC era.

Conclusion: Insight-A effectively addresses the limitations of standard MLLM prompting by incorporating attribution analysis, offering a robust framework for detecting AI-generated multimodal misinformation through forgery source identification and cross-modal consistency checking.

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has emerged as a prevalent alternative to create multimodal misinformation on social media platforms, posing unprecedented threats to societal safety. However, standard prompting leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify the emerging misinformation, which ignores the misinformation attribution. To this end, we present Insight-A, exploring attribution with MLLM insights for detecting multimodal misinformation. Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposal and provide a new paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection in the era of AIGC.

*Hui Wang,Fafa Zhang,Xiaoyu Zhang,Chaoxu Mu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NRPA-GD is a novel dialogue policy planning method that uses LLMs to simulate both user and system behaviors without specific model training, employing nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to optimize goal-oriented dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for goal-oriented dialogue tasks either rely on elaborate prompt engineering (dependent on human experience) or integrate policy networks/pre-trained models (difficult to adapt to new scenarios and costly to train). There's a need for a method that avoids specific model training while effectively steering interactions toward goals within limited turns.

Method: NRPA-GD uses a Large Language Model to simultaneously simulate user and system behaviors. It constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework combining nested Monte Carlo simulation with policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process.

Result: Experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, it surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models using only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM.

Conclusion: NRPA-GD demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks, offering an effective approach for goal-oriented dialogue that avoids costly model training while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: In goal-oriented dialogue tasks, the main challenge is to steer the interaction towards a given goal within a limited number of turns. Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks.

*Matteo Spreafico,Ludovica Tassini,Camilla Sancricca,Cinzia Cappiello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively support data preparation tasks like profiling and cleaning, performing comparably to traditional tools but with different strengths and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data preparation is critical but labor-intensive in data-driven processes, and LLMs' capabilities for automating these tasks need systematic evaluation compared to traditional tools.

Method: Tested both general-purpose and fine-tuned tabular LLMs by prompting them with poor-quality datasets, measuring performance on data profiling and cleaning tasks, and comparing with traditional data preparation tools using a custom-designed quality model validated through user studies.

Result: LLMs demonstrated effective support for data preparation tasks, with performance comparable to traditional tools but showing different patterns of strengths and weaknesses in handling various data quality issues.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automating data preparation tasks and can complement traditional tools, though their effectiveness varies depending on the specific task and model type, suggesting a hybrid approach may be optimal.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated their exceptional capabilities in supporting and automating various tasks. Among the tasks worth exploring for testing large language model capabilities, we considered data preparation, a critical yet often labor-intensive step in data-driven processes. This paper investigates whether large language models can effectively support users in selecting and automating data preparation tasks. To this aim, we considered both general-purpose and fine-tuned tabular large language models. We prompted these models with poor-quality datasets and measured their ability to perform tasks such as data profiling and cleaning. We also compare the support provided by large language models with that offered by traditional data preparation tools. To evaluate the capabilities of large language models, we developed a custom-designed quality model that has been validated through a user study to gain insights into practitioners' expectations.

### [211] [Quantifying and Mitigating Selection Bias in LLMs: A Transferable LoRA Fine-Tuning and Efficient Majority Voting Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21709)
*Blessed Guda,Lawrence Francis,Gabrial Zencha Ashungafac,Carlee Joe-Wong,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes new methods to measure and mitigate selection bias in LLMs for MCQ evaluation, including a permutation-based bias metric, efficient majority voting, and unsupervised fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks (influenced by answer position/option symbols rather than content), undermining MCQ reliability as an evaluation framework. Existing bias metrics require labels and don't capture prediction consistency across permutations, while mitigation strategies are either computationally expensive or lack generalization.

Method: Three key contributions: (1) Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) - unsupervised label-free metric quantifying inconsistencies across answer permutations; (2) Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV) - efficient majority voting approach reducing computational costs; (3) LoRA-1 - unsupervised fine-tuning strategy using PBM and BaQCKV to mitigate bias while maintaining efficiency and generalizability.

Result: Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks show the approaches reduce bias, increase consistency in accuracy, and minimize computational costs compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide more precise bias measurement and efficient mitigation strategies that address limitations of existing approaches, improving the reliability of MCQ evaluation for LLMs while maintaining computational efficiency and generalizability.

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) answering is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability. Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches reduce bias, increasing consistency in accuracy while minimizing computational costs.

### [212] [Addressing Stereotypes in Large Language Models: A Critical Examination and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21711)
*Fatima Kazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) using bias-specific benchmarks, finding that fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but handle racial biases better, and that LLMs often rely too heavily on keywords rather than understanding content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training data, including social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices. As LLMs become more prevalent in various applications, it's crucial to identify, understand, and mitigate these biases to ensure fair outputs and reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation.

Method: Used bias-specific benchmarks (StereoSet and CrowSPairs) to evaluate biases in various generative models (BERT, GPT 3.5, ADA). Adopted a three-pronged approach to detect both explicit and implicit biases. Applied enhancement strategies including fine-tuning, different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of bias benchmarks.

Result: Fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts rather than understanding content. Fine-tuned models showed promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with gains up to 20%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs and demonstrates that while current models have limitations (particularly with gender biases and keyword over-reliance), enhancement strategies like fine-tuning can improve performance on bias detection, especially for implicit biases.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity in recent years with the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with use cases spanning many disciplines and daily lives as well. LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

TL;DR: EulerESG is an LLM-powered system that automates ESG disclosure analysis by explicitly modeling ESG frameworks, combining dual-channel retrieval with interactive visualization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG reports are published as long, heterogeneous PDF documents, making it difficult to systematically answer questions. Existing tools either use brittle rule-based extraction or treat ESG reports as generic text without modeling underlying reporting standards.

Method: EulerESG combines dual-channel retrieval and LLM-driven disclosure analysis over ESG reports with an interactive dashboard and chatbot for exploration, benchmarking, and explanation.

Result: The system can automatically populate standard-aligned metric tables with high fidelity (up to 0.95 average accuracy) while remaining practical in end-to-end runtime, tested on four globally recognized companies and twelve SASB sub-industries.

Conclusion: EulerESG provides an effective LLM-powered solution for automating ESG disclosure analysis with explicit awareness of ESG frameworks, making ESG data more accessible and analyzable.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports have become central to how companies communicate climate risk, social impact, and governance practices, yet they are still published primarily as long, heterogeneous PDF documents. This makes it difficult to systematically answer seemingly simple questions. Existing tools either rely on brittle rule-based extraction or treat ESG reports as generic text, without explicitly modelling the underlying reporting standards. We present \textbf{EulerESG}, an LLM-powered system for automating ESG disclosure analysis with explicit awareness of ESG frameworks. EulerESG combines (i) dual-channel retrieval and LLM-driven disclosure analysis over ESG reports, and (ii) an interactive dashboard and chatbot for exploration, benchmarking, and explanation. Using four globally recognised companies and twelve SASB sub-industries, we show that EulerESG can automatically populate standard-aligned metric tables with high fidelity (up to 0.95 average accuracy) while remaining practical in end-to-end runtime, and we compare several recent LLM models in this setting. The full implementation, together with a demonstration video, is publicly available at https://github.com/UNSW-database/EulerESG.

*Shabbir Anees,Anshuman,Ayush Chaurasia,Prathmesh Bogar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Advanced ML system detects AI-generated reviews with 95.4% accuracy using Harris Hawks Optimization for feature selection and stacking ensemble classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fraudulent AI-generated reviews undermine trust in online purchases, creating a need for accurate detection systems to distinguish human from computer-generated content.

Method: Combines text preprocessing, multi-modal feature extraction, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for feature selection (reducing 13,539 to 1,368 features), and stacking ensemble classifier.

Result: Achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and 93.90% F1-Score on dataset of 40,432 original and computer-generated reviews.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning with bio-inspired optimization effectively detects machine-generated text; privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy are essential for cloud-based review analytics.

Abstract: It is well known that fraudulent reviews cast doubt on the legitimacy and dependability of online purchases. The most recent development that leads customers towards darkness is the appearance of human reviews in computer-generated (CG) ones. In this work, we present an advanced machine-learning-based system that analyses these reviews produced by AI with remarkable precision. Our method integrates advanced text preprocessing, multi-modal feature extraction, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for feature selection, and a stacking ensemble classifier. We implemented this methodology on a public dataset of 40,432 Original (OR) and Computer-Generated (CG) reviews. From an initial set of 13,539 features, HHO selected the most applicable 1,368 features, achieving an 89.9% dimensionality reduction. Our final stacking model achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and a 93.90% F1-Score, which demonstrates that the combination of ensemble learning and bio-inspired optimisation is an effective method for machine-generated text recognition. Because large-scale review analytics commonly run on cloud platforms, privacy-preserving techniques such as differential approaches and secure outsourcing are essential to protect user data in these systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrossCheck-Bench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs' ability to detect contradictions between visual and textual inputs, revealing significant performance gaps in logical reasoning compared to perceptual matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs are primarily trained on aligned image-text pairs, leaving their ability to detect and resolve real-world inconsistencies largely unexplored. In open-domain applications, visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment.

Method: The authors introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark with 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. It uses a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving 450+ expert hours.

Result: Evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models shows consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Conventional prompting strategies yield only marginal gains, while methods interleaving symbolic reasoning with visual processing achieve more stable improvements.

Conclusion: The results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification, particularly emphasizing the need for approaches that combine symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing.

We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.

*Zhaoxin Zhang,Borui Chen,Yiming Hu,Youyang Qu,Tianqing Zhu,Longxiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MICM is a novel jailbreak method that exploits LLMs' abstract generalization capabilities to manipulate embedded social values, bypassing safety filters by using conceptual triggers in a fixed prompt template.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM jailbreak research focuses on overt harmful outputs, overlooking attacks that exploit abstract generalization and manipulation of implicit social values, creating a critical blind spot in alignment strategies.

Method: MICM uses conceptual morphology theory to encode specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through predefined phrases that act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward specific value stances without triggering safety filters.

Result: MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques across five advanced LLMs (including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B), achieving high success rates with minimal rejection.

Conclusion: Commercial LLMs have a critical vulnerability: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment through abstract generalization attacks.

Abstract: Recent research on large language model (LLM) jailbreaks has primarily focused on techniques that bypass safety mechanisms to elicit overtly harmful outputs. However, such efforts often overlook attacks that exploit the model's capacity for abstract generalization, creating a critical blind spot in current alignment strategies. This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment.

TL;DR: PeerCoPilot is an LLM-powered assistant that helps peer providers at behavioral health organizations create wellness plans, set goals, and find resources, with over 90% user support and demonstrated reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral health conditions are the leading disease burden in the US, and peer-run organizations (PROs) struggle with limited funds and staffing to address all service user needs, requiring better tools to support peer providers.

Method: Developed PeerCoPilot, an LLM-powered assistant with retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a database of over 1,300 vetted resources to help create wellness plans, construct step-by-step goals, and locate organizational resources.

Result: Human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users showed over 90% user support for using PeerCoPilot. The system provides more reliable and specific information than baseline LLM and is currently used by 5-10 peer providers at CSPNJ serving over 10,000 users.

Conclusion: PeerCoPilot effectively supports peer providers in behavioral health organizations, demonstrating high user acceptance and improved reliability over standard LLMs, with active expansion underway.

Abstract: Behavioral health conditions, which include mental health and substance use disorders, are the leading disease burden in the United States. Peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) critically assist individuals facing these conditions by combining mental health services with assistance for needs such as income, employment, and housing. However, limited funds and staffing make it difficult for PROs to address all service user needs. To assist peer providers at PROs with their day-to-day tasks, we introduce PeerCoPilot, a large language model (LLM)-powered assistant that helps peer providers create wellness plans, construct step-by-step goals, and locate organizational resources to support these goals. PeerCoPilot ensures information reliability through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a large database of over 1,300 vetted resources. We conducted human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users and found that over 90% of users supported using PeerCoPilot. Moreover, we demonstrated that PeerCoPilot provides more reliable and specific information than a baseline LLM. PeerCoPilot is now used by a group of 5-10 peer providers at CSPNJ, a large behavioral health organization serving over 10,000 service users, and we are actively expanding PeerCoPilot's use.

TL;DR: GGP is a comprehensive persona prompt collection built from German social survey data that enables LLMs to simulate population-aligned responses, outperforming classifiers especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current persona prompting for LLM-based social simulations lacks well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections, limiting accuracy and representativeness of human perspective simulations in computational social science.

Method: Created German General Personas (GGP) collection from German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) data, designed as plug-in persona prompts for LLMs. Evaluated by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across topics and analyzing representativity and attribute selection effects.

Result: GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers in simulating survey response distributions, particularly under data scarcity conditions. Analysis shows how representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses.

Conclusion: GGP provides a valuable resource for LLM-based social simulations, enabling systematic exploration of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human perspectives via persona prompting is gaining traction in computational social science. However, well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections remain scarce, limiting the accuracy and representativeness of such simulations. Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AD-CDO is a lightweight ontology that standardizes Alzheimer's disease clinical trial eligibility criteria using semantic categories and biomedical vocabularies, achieving 63% concept coverage with practical applications in trial simulation and data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for standardized representation of eligibility criteria in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials, bridging the gap between broad biomedical ontologies and specific trial modeling requirements.

Method: Extracted high-frequency concepts from 1,500+ AD trials, organized into 7 semantic categories, annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies (UMLS, OMOP, DrugBank, etc.), and optimized using Jenks Natural Breaks method for coverage-manageability balance.

Result: AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness. Demonstrated utility through trial simulation system and entity normalization for EHR integration.

Conclusion: AD-CDO provides a versatile foundation for ontology-driven AD clinical trial research by harmonizing eligibility entities with standardized vocabularies, supporting downstream applications like phenotyping and cohort identification.

Abstract: Objective
  This study introduces the Alzheimer's Disease Common Data Element Ontology for Clinical Trials (AD-CDO), a lightweight, semantically enriched ontology designed to represent and standardize key eligibility criteria concepts in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.
  Materials and Methods
  We extracted high-frequency concepts from more than 1,500 AD clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and organized them into seven semantic categories: Disease, Medication, Diagnostic Test, Procedure, Social Determinants of Health, Rating Criteria, and Fertility. Each concept was annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies, including the UMLS, OMOP Standardized Vocabularies, DrugBank, NDC, and NLM VSAC value sets. To balance coverage and manageability, we applied the Jenks Natural Breaks method to identify an optimal set of representative concepts.
  Results
  The optimized AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness. The ontology effectively captured the most frequent and clinically meaningful entities used in AD eligibility criteria. We demonstrated AD-CDO's practical utility through two use cases: (a) an ontology-driven trial simulation system for formal modeling and virtual execution of clinical trials, and (b) an entity normalization task mapping raw clinical text to ontology-aligned terms, enabling consistency and integration with EHR data.
  Discussion
  AD-CDO bridges the gap between broad biomedical ontologies and task-specific trial modeling needs. It supports multiple downstream applications, including phenotyping algorithm development, cohort identification, and structured data integration.
  Conclusion
  By harmonizing essential eligibility entities and aligning them with standardized vocabularies, AD-CDO provides a versatile foundation for ontology-driven AD clinical trial research.

*Yizhou Xu,Janet Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptTailor is a lightweight system that expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving user intent, using a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with LoRA on prompt-refinement dialogues distilled from stronger LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight language models are sensitive to prompt quality, but non-expert users often lack knowledge or time to craft high-quality prompts. Existing prompt optimization tools may not ensure alignment with users' original intents and preferences.

Method: PromptTailor uses a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The system expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving user preferences.

Result: In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9).

Conclusion: A compact student model guided by powerful teachers can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent, enabling efficient edge deployment for on-device applications.

Abstract: Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent.

TL;DR: SUMER introduces a reinforcement learning agent that learns to search uncompressed memory instead of using biased compression algorithms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context conversation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory frameworks for LLMs focus on finding optimal compression algorithms, which introduces human bias through specific prompts and architectures tailored to benchmarks, rather than finding general solutions that work across different data distributions.

Method: SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay) is an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information from uncompressed memory and answer target questions.

Result: On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct outperformed all biased memory compression approaches and the full-context baseline, achieving a 43% gain over prior best results and reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Simple search methods applied to raw data outperform goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable for long-context memory tasks.

Abstract: How to enable human-like long-term memory in large language models (LLMs) has been a central question for unlocking more general capabilities such as few-shot generalization. Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable. Code for SUMER and all implemented baselines is publicly available at https://github.com/zycyc/SUMER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AffectMind is a multimodal affective dialogue agent that uses proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to create emotionally aligned, persuasive marketing conversations, outperforming LLM baselines in emotional consistency and persuasive success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based dialogue systems are reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings like marketing conversations, lacking proactive reasoning and emotional alignment capabilities needed for persuasive interactions.

Method: Three-component system: 1) Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) for continuous multimodal context updates; 2) Emotion-Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) for joint emotion/intent modeling and persuasion strategy adaptation; 3) Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) for optimizing emotional coherence via reinforcement learning from user responses.

Result: Outperforms strong LLM baselines on two marketing dialogue datasets (MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo) with +26% emotional consistency, +19% persuasive success rate, and +23% long-term user engagement.

Conclusion: Emotion-grounded proactivity is a key capability for commercial multimodal agents, enabling more effective persuasive interactions through continuous affective reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled fluent dialogue systems, but most remain reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings such as marketing conversations. To address this limitation, we propose AffectMind, a multimodal affective dialogue agent that performs proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to sustain emotionally aligned and persuasive interactions. AffectMind combines three components: a Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) that continuously updates factual and affective context from text, vision, and prosody; an Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) that jointly models user emotion and purchase intent to adapt persuasion strategies; and a Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) that optimizes emotional coherence and engagement via reinforcement signals from user responses. Experiments on two newly curated marketing dialogue datasets, MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo, show that AffectMind outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in emotional consistency (+26\%), persuasive success rate (+19\%), and long-term user engagement (+23\%), highlighting emotion-grounded proactivity as a key capability for commercial multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG system improvements work synergistically - individual enhancements provide little benefit alone, but combined achieve 95% reduction in abstention without increasing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different RAG components interact and identify measurement challenges in evaluating RAG system performance, particularly around verification strategies and labeling inconsistencies.

Method: Conducted ablation studies on 50 queries (15 answerable, 10 edge cases, 25 adversarial) to test components like hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding both in isolation and combination.

Result: Individual enhancements provided almost no benefit alone, but together achieved 95% reduction in abstention (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. Identified labeling inconsistencies that create apparent hallucination rates.

Conclusion: Synergistic integration matters more than any single component; standardized metrics and labels are essential for correct performance interpretation; adaptive calibration prevents overconfident over-answering even with high retrieval quality.

Abstract: Building reliable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems requires more than adding powerful components; it requires understanding how they interact. Using ablation studies on 50 queries (15 answerable, 10 edge cases, and 25 adversarial), we show that enhancements such as hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding provide almost no benefit when used in isolation, yet together achieve a 95% reduction in abstention (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. We also identify a measurement challenge: different verification strategies can behave safely but assign inconsistent labels (for example, "abstained" versus "unsupported"), creating apparent hallucination rates that are actually artifacts of labeling. Our results show that synergistic integration matters more than the strength of any single component, that standardized metrics and labels are essential for correctly interpreting performance, and that adaptive calibration is needed to prevent overconfident over-answering even when retrieval quality is high.

### [224] [A Benchmark for Procedural Memory Retrieval in Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21730)
*Ishant Kohar,Aswanth Krishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate procedural memory retrieval in AI agents, showing that current embedding methods fail on novel tasks while LLM-generated abstractions enable reliable cross-context transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents fail when faced with novel tasks with unseen vocabularies, revealing a core limitation in procedural memory systems that needs to be addressed.

Method: Using ALFWorld, the authors construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods with systematically stratified queries to isolate procedural memory retrieval from task execution.

Result: Embedding-based methods perform well on familiar contexts but degrade sharply on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Corpus scale provides larger gains than representation enrichment.

Conclusion: The benchmark offers a diagnostic framework to separate genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and provides tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

Abstract: Current AI agents excel in familiar settings, but fail sharply when faced with novel tasks with unseen vocabularies -- a core limitation of procedural memory systems. We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders. Our benchmark offers the first diagnostic framework separating genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and gives tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit quantum-like structures in conceptual processing, showing entanglement in concepts and Bose-Einstein statistics in word distributions, mirroring human cognitive patterns and suggesting evolutionary convergence in meaning organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models exhibit quantum-like structures in conceptual processing similar to those observed in human cognition, and to understand the underlying mechanisms of meaning organization in both biological and artificial cognitive systems.

Method: Two cognitive tests using ChatGPT and Gemini: 1) Testing Bell's inequalities violation in conceptual combinations to detect quantum entanglement, 2) Analyzing word distribution statistics in large texts to identify statistical patterns (Bose-Einstein vs Maxwell-Boltzmann).

Result: LLMs significantly violate Bell's inequalities (indicating quantum entanglement in concepts) and exhibit Bose-Einstein statistics in word distributions rather than expected Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, mirroring results previously found in human cognitive tests and information retrieval on large corpora.

Conclusion: Quantum structures systematically emerge in conceptual-linguistic domains regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial, suggesting evolutionary convergence between human cognition (biological evolution) and LLM cognition (self-learning/training) through the semantic structure of vector spaces.

Abstract: We present the results of cognitive tests on conceptual combinations, performed using specific Large Language Models (LLMs) as test subjects. In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis. We also advance a unifying framework that explains the pervasive quantum organization of meaning that we identify.

TL;DR: RoSA is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that selectively enhances low-frequency RoPE-influenced attention states and dynamically selects critical layers for more targeted adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PEFT methods ignore distinct roles of model components and heterogeneous importance across layers, limiting adaptation efficiency. RoPE induces critical activations in low-frequency dimensions of attention states, suggesting more targeted parameter allocation.

Method: RoSA combines RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module that selectively enhances low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms.

Result: Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks show RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters.

Conclusion: RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning by combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, demonstrating superior performance over existing PEFT approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models is essential for task-specific adaptation, yet it remains computationally prohibitive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks demonstrate that RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters.

### [227] [Asking LLMs to Verify First is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21734)
*Shiguang Wu,Quanming Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verification-First (VF) strategy prompts LLMs to verify candidate answers before solving problems, triggering reverse reasoning that reduces errors with minimal cost. Iter-VF extends this with iterative verification-generation cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without expensive training or extensive test-time sampling, addressing the need for cost-effective performance improvements.

Method: VF strategy prompts models to verify provided candidate answers (even trivial/random ones) before generating solutions, triggering reverse reasoning. Iter-VF generalizes this with sequential test-time scaling through iterative verification-generation cycles using previous answers.

Result: VF with random answers consistently outperforms standard Chain-of-Thought across various benchmarks (mathematical reasoning, coding, agentic tasks) and LLMs (1B to cutting-edge commercial models) with minimal computational overhead. Iter-VF outperforms existing test-time scaling strategies.

Conclusion: Verification-First is an effective, low-cost strategy that enhances LLM reasoning by triggering complementary reverse reasoning processes, with Iter-VF providing further improvements through iterative refinement.

Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without high costs of training, nor extensive test-time sampling, we introduce Verification-First (VF), a strategy that prompts models to verify a provided candidate answer, even a trivial or random one, before generating a solution. This approach triggers a "reverse reasoning" process that is cognitively easier and complementary to standard forward Chain-of-Thought (CoT), effectively invoking the model's critical thinking to reduce logical errors. We further generalize the VF strategy to Iter-VF, a sequential test-time scaling (TTS) method that iteratively cycles the verification-generation process using the model's previous answer. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks (from mathematical reasoning to coding and agentic tasks) and various LLMs (from open-source 1B to cutting-edge commercial ones) confirm that VF with random answer consistently outperforms standard CoT with minimal computational overhead, and Iter-VF outperforms existing TTS strategies.

TL;DR: MAIRA-X is a multimodal AI model for chest X-ray report generation that improves over state-of-the-art in lexical quality, clinical correctness, and lines & tubes reporting, with user studies showing comparable error rates to original reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce radiologists' workload from expanded screening guidelines, complex cases, and workforce shortages while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, particularly for the demanding and repetitive task of interpreting lines and tubes in chest X-rays.

Method: Developed MAIRA-X using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (6M images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic. Evaluated on three holdout datasets and MIMIC-CXR, with novel L&T-specific metrics framework and retrospective user evaluation study involving 9 radiologists reviewing 600 studies.

Result: Significantly improved AI-generated reports over state-of-the-art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T elements. User study found comparable critical error rates (3.0% original vs. 4.6% AI) and similar acceptable sentence rates (97.8% original vs. 97.4% AI), marking significant improvement over prior studies.

Conclusion: MAIRA-X can effectively assist radiologists in high-volume clinical settings by generating clinically accurate reports with comparable error rates to original reports, particularly for lines and tubes interpretation.

Abstract: AI-assisted report generation offers the opportunity to reduce radiologists' workload stemming from expanded screening guidelines, complex cases and workforce shortages, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates. Our results suggest that MAIRA-X can effectively assist radiologists, particularly in high-volume clinical settings.

*Jiayi Chen,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Chen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2Q is a novel 2-bit quantization framework that decomposes quantization into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations using residual refinement, outperforming existing 2-bit methods across various benchmarks and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and memory demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) drive the need for low-bit quantization. While 8-bit and 4-bit quantization are common, extending to 2 bits is challenging due to severe accuracy degradation, creating a need for better 2-bit quantization methods.

Method: Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q) decomposes the 2-bit quantization process into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations, forming an adaptive quantization lattice. It uses a residual learning mechanism to refine quantization, and features a modular design that integrates with existing quantization-aware training frameworks.

Result: Extensive evaluations on Llama, OPT, and Qwen models across diverse benchmarks (question answering, commonsense reasoning, language modeling) show that R2Q consistently outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in both fine-grained and coarse-grained settings. It enhances performance, improves training stability, and accelerates convergence under extreme compression.

Conclusion: R2Q provides an effective solution for 2-bit quantization of LLMs, addressing accuracy degradation challenges through residual refinement. Its modular design enables practical deployment with existing quantization frameworks, making it a promising approach for extreme model compression.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought substantial computational and memory demands, spurring the adoption of low-bit quantization. While 8-bit and 4-bit formats have become prevalent, extending quantization to 2 bits remains challenging due to severe accuracy degradation. To address this, we propose Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q)-a novel 2-bit quantization framework that decomposes the process into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations, forming an adaptive quantization lattice. Extensive evaluations on Llama, OPT, and Qwen across diverse benchmarks-covering question answering, commonsense reasoning, and language modeling-demonstrate that R2Q consistently outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in both fine-grained and coarse-grained settings. By refining quantization through a residual learning mechanism, R2Q enhances performance, improves training stability, and accelerates convergence under extreme compression. Furthermore, its modular design enables seamless integration with existing quantization-aware training (QAT) frameworks.

### [230] [Polarity-Aware Probing for Quantifying Latent Alignment in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21737)
*Sabrina Sadiekh,Elena Ericheva,Chirag Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PA-CCS is a polarity-aware probing method that evaluates model alignment by testing consistency of internal representations under polarity inversion, revealing differences in how models encode harmful vs. safe knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether unsupervised probes like CCS can reliably assess model alignment, and to develop methods for evaluating whether models' internal representations remain consistent when statements are inverted from harmful to safe or vice versa.

Method: Introduces Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS) with two alignment metrics: Polar-Consistency and Contradiction Index. Uses curated datasets with matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed via concurrent and antagonistic statements. Tests on 16 language models with polarity inversion experiments.

Result: PA-CCS identifies architectural and layer-specific differences in encoding latent harmful knowledge. Models with well-aligned representations show degraded PA-CCS scores when negation tokens are replaced with meaningless markers, while poorly calibrated models don't show this degradation.

Conclusion: Unsupervised probing shows potential for alignment evaluation, but requires structural robustness checks. The method highlights differences in how models internally represent harmful vs. safe content, with implications for interpretability benchmarks.

Abstract: Advances in unsupervised probes such as Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), which reveal latent beliefs without relying on token outputs, raise the question of whether these methods can reliably assess model alignment. We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BIT is an end-to-end Brain-to-Text framework using a single differentiable neural network with cross-species pretrained encoder and audio LLMs, achieving SOTA performance and enabling cross-task generalization between attempted and imagined speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech BCIs use cascaded frameworks with separate phoneme decoding and language modeling stages that prevent joint optimization, limiting performance and integration capabilities.

Method: End-to-end Brain-to-Text framework with cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, integrated with audio large language models using contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on Brain-to-Text benchmarks (10.22% WER vs prior 24.69%), enables cross-task generalization between attempted/imagined speech, and shows small-scale audio LLMs significantly improve end-to-end decoding.

Conclusion: BIT advances integration of diverse neural datasets and enables seamless differentiable optimization, paving the way for more effective end-to-end speech BCI frameworks.

Abstract: Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aim to restore communication for people with paralysis by translating neural activity into text. Most systems use cascaded frameworks that decode phonemes before assembling sentences with an n-gram language model (LM), preventing joint optimization of all stages simultaneously. Here, we introduce an end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework that translates neural activity into coherent sentences using a single differentiable neural network. Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech. In a cascaded setting with an n-gram LM, the pretrained encoder establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Brain-to-Text '24 and '25 benchmarks. Integrated end-to-end with audio large language models (LLMs) and trained with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment, BIT reduces the word error rate (WER) of the prior end-to-end method from 24.69% to 10.22%. Notably, we find that small-scale audio LLMs markedly improve end-to-end decoding. Beyond record-setting performance, BIT aligns attempted and imagined speech embeddings to enable cross-task generalization. Altogether, our approach advances the integration of large, diverse neural datasets, paving the way for an end-to-end decoding framework that supports seamless, differentiable optimization.

TL;DR: A geometric method integrating text and co-author networks using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to create hierarchical topic dendrograms that capture rare topics and smooth temporal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable topic modeling is needed to track research evolution in co-author communities, especially to identify underrepresented niche topics that dense transformer embeddings often miss, leading to poor temporal alignment.

Method: Geometric method integrating multimodal text and co-author network data using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct hierarchical topic dendrogram, capturing both local and global structure for multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions.

Result: Effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time, demonstrating strength of interpretable bag-of-words models with principled geometric alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric approach successfully addresses limitations of contemporary models by capturing rare topics and enabling smooth temporal alignment through hierarchical topic dendrograms.

Abstract: Interpretable topic modeling is essential for tracking how research interests evolve within co-author communities. In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.

We benchmark function-calling performance across LLMs, compare our novel structure-aware retrieval method to vector-based and LLM-scoring baselines, and evaluate various LLMs for response synthesis. This modular approach reveals specific failure modes and performance patterns, supporting the development of interpretable and effective educational QA systems.

### [234] [Scaling Competence, Shrinking Reasoning: Cognitive Signatures in Language Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21743)
*Mukul Singh,Ananya Singha,Arjun Radhakrishna,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes reasoning tokens in language models during fine-tuning, comparing them to human working memory, and tracks their evolution through cognitive competence stages to optimize training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how reasoning tokens (intermediate steps) in language models evolve during task-specific fine-tuning and draw parallels with human cognitive processes, particularly working memory and competence development.

Method: Align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence from cognitive science: unconscious incompetence (incorrect outputs without reasoning), conscious incompetence (reasoning but still failing), conscious competence (effective reasoning), and unconscious competence (solving without explicit reasoning). Track reasoning token length and dynamics throughout training.

Result: Reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at conscious competence stage, then declines as models internalize tasks. After training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed, suggesting reasoning scaffolds learning but becomes unnecessary. Reasoning token dynamics serve as diagnostic signals for training stage, convergence, and early stopping.

Conclusion: Reasoning behavior provides valuable insights for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training. The progression through competence stages offers actionable metrics for diagnosing training progress, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping decisions.

Abstract: We analyze reasoning in language models during task-specific fine-tuning and draws parallel between reasoning tokens--intermediate steps generated while solving problem and the human working memory. Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping. We propose metrics to track this trajectory and argue that reasoning behavior is valuable for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NEULIF is a lightweight AI-generated text detector using stylometric/readability features with CNN/RF classifiers, achieving 97% accuracy while being orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated text detectors rely on computationally expensive transformer models with limited generalization, while lightweight alternatives have poor accuracy. There's a need for efficient, accurate detectors that work across domains without extensive computational power.

Method: Texts are decomposed into stylometric and readability features, then classified using either a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF) model. The approach avoids large transformer architectures in favor of feature-based classification.

Result: On the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus: CNN achieves 97% accuracy (~0.95 F1), 99.5% ROC-AUC; Random Forest achieves 95% accuracy (~0.94 F1), 95% ROC-AUC. Models are extremely small (CNN: ~25 MB, RF: ~10.6 MB) compared to transformer ensembles.

Conclusion: NEULIF demonstrates that lightweight, feature-based approaches can rival complex transformer models in AI-generated text detection, offering high accuracy with minimal computational requirements. This enables broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts.

Abstract: A growing number of AI-generated texts raise serious concerns. Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets. We introduce NEULIF, a lightweight approach that achieves best performance in the lightweight detector class, that does not require extensive computational power and provides high detection accuracy. In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy.This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection.

TL;DR: A cost-efficient pipeline combining synthetic data generation and domain data curation trains specialized 3B-parameter LLMs for industrial fault diagnosis, achieving 25% accuracy improvements over comparable open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges in specialized domains: SaaS solutions raise privacy concerns, open-source models require heavy resources, and domain-specific training data is scarce. Need efficient methods to create specialized small models.

Method: Cost-efficient pipeline with guided synthetic data generation from seed corpus and bottom-up domain data curation. Integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Demonstrated with DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter model for industrial fault diagnosis.

Result: DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models (2B-9B) on DiagnosticMCQ benchmark. Outperforms or matches comparable models on DiagnosticQA, DiagnosticComp, and DiagnosticSum tasks, showing effective domain-specific reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables efficient development of specialized small-scale LLMs for domain-specific applications, addressing privacy, resource, and data scarcity challenges while achieving competitive performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in supporting a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: BRIES is a compound AI system with specialized agents for generating, detecting, defending against, and assessing persuasion attacks, revealing significant performance differences across language models and providing insights into cognitive vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance generative AI safety and cognitive security by quantifying LLM-specific vulnerabilities to persuasion attacks and developing a framework for enhancing human cognitive resilience through structured interventions before exposure to harmful content.

Method: Developed BRIES architecture with four specialized agents: Twister (generates adversarial content), Detector (identifies attack types), Defender (creates resilient content via inoculation), and Assessor (evaluates effectiveness using causal inference). Tested using SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy on synthetic persuasion dataset across multiple language models (GPT-4, Llama3, Mistral, Gemma).

Result: Significant performance variations across models: GPT-4 achieved superior detection accuracy on complex persuasion techniques, while open-source models (Llama3, Mistral) showed weaknesses in identifying subtle rhetorical techniques. Prompt engineering dramatically affected detection efficacy with temperature settings producing model-specific variations. Causal analysis revealed different persuasion attacks target specific cognitive dimensions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that different LLM architectures encode and process persuasive language patterns in fundamentally different ways, providing novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks and delivering a framework for enhancing cognitive resilience through structured interventions.

Abstract: This paper introduces BRIES, a novel compound AI architecture designed to detect and measure the effectiveness of persuasion attacks across information environments. We present a system with specialized agents: a Twister that generates adversarial content employing targeted persuasion tactics, a Detector that identifies attack types with configurable parameters, a Defender that creates resilient content through content inoculation, and an Assessor that employs causal inference to evaluate inoculation effectiveness. Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents. Our comparative analysis reveals significant performance disparities with GPT-4 achieving superior detection accuracy on complex persuasion techniques, while open-source models like Llama3 and Mistral demonstrated notable weaknesses in identifying subtle rhetorical, suggesting that different architectures encode and process persuasive language patterns in fundamentally different ways. We show that prompt engineering dramatically affects detection efficacy, with temperature settings and confidence scoring producing model-specific variations; Gemma and GPT-4 perform optimally at lower temperatures while Llama3 and Mistral show improved capabilities at higher temperatures. Our causal analysis provides novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks, revealing that different attack types target specific cognitive dimensions. This research advances generative AI safety and cognitive security by quantifying LLM-specific vulnerabilities to persuasion attacks and delivers a framework for enhancing human cognitive resilience through structured interventions before exposure to harmful content.

### [239] [Semantics as a Shield: Label Disguise Defense (LDD) against Prompt Injection in LLM Sentiment Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21752)
*Yanxi Li,Ruocheng Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Label Disguise Defense (LDD) protects LLMs from prompt injection attacks by replacing true labels with disguised aliases, preventing attackers from directly manipulating classification outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM text classification systems are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, especially class-directive injections that exploit knowledge of label sets. Existing defenses require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation, creating a need for lightweight, model-agnostic protection.

Method: LDD conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels (e.g., "blue" vs. "yellow" instead of "positive" vs. "negative"). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs.

Result: LDD was evaluated across nine state-of-the-art models (GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, Mistral variants). For every model, LDD restored a portion of accuracy degradation caused by attacks, with most models achieving higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline. Semantically aligned alias labels (e.g., "good" vs. "bad") provided stronger robustness than unaligned symbols.

Conclusion: Label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer against prompt injection attacks, transforming meaning itself into a shield. LDD offers a lightweight, model-agnostic solution that doesn't require retraining and demonstrates practical protection across diverse LLM architectures.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.

### [240] [Extracting Disaster Impacts and Impact Related Locations in Social Media Posts Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21753)
*Sameeah Noreen Hameed,Surangika Ranathunga,Raj Prasanna,Kristin Stock,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs extract disaster impacts and impacted locations from social media posts, outperforming baseline models for situational awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional disaster monitoring methods (sensors, satellites) have geo-temporal information gaps, while social media posts contain valuable impact information but need filtering to distinguish impacted vs. non-impacted locations for effective resource allocation.

Method: Fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts, and specifically impacted locations in disaster-related social media posts, handling informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms.

Result: Fine-tuned model achieves F1-scores of 0.69 for impact extraction and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming pre-trained baseline models.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned language models offer scalable solutions for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning by effectively extracting critical impact information from social media.

Abstract: Large-scale disasters can often result in catastrophic consequences on people and infrastructure. Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as "geo-sensors" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., "The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece." contains impacted location "Mati" and non-impacted locations "Greece" and "Athens". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders.

*Soham Mirajkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers identify a dual-stage mechanism in LLMs for arithmetic hallucinations: distributed computation in middle layers and decisive aggregation in late layers (Layer 46), enabling 98% accurate detection of hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs deployed in high-stakes financial domains suffer from reproducible arithmetic hallucinations, but current mitigation strategies treat models as black boxes, lacking mechanistic understanding.

Method: Applied Causal Tracing to GPT-2 XL architecture on ConvFinQA benchmark to identify arithmetic reasoning mechanisms, conducted ablation studies, and trained linear probes on identified critical layers.

Result: Identified dual-stage mechanism: computational scratchpad in layers 12-30 and decisive aggregation circuit in Layer 46. Suppressing Layer 46 reduced confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%. Linear probe on Layer 46 achieved 98% accuracy in detecting hallucinations across unseen financial topics.

Conclusion: The study reveals a universal geometry of arithmetic deception in LLMs, providing a mechanistic approach to intrinsic hallucination detection that could improve reliability in financial applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes financial domains, yet they suffer from specific, reproducible hallucinations when performing arithmetic operations. Current mitigation strategies often treat the model as a black box. In this work, we propose a mechanistic approach to intrinsic hallucination detection. By applying Causal Tracing to the GPT-2 XL architecture on the ConvFinQA benchmark, we identify a dual-stage mechanism for arithmetic reasoning: a distributed computational scratchpad in middle layers (L12-L30) and a decisive aggregation circuit in late layers (specifically Layer 46). We verify this mechanism via an ablation study, demonstrating that suppressing Layer 46 reduces the model's confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a linear probe trained on this layer generalizes to unseen financial topics with 98% accuracy, suggesting a universal geometry of arithmetic deception.

*Linye Wei,Wenjue Chen,Pingzhi Tang,Xiaotian Guo,Le Ye,Runsheng Wang,Meng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ODB-dLLM accelerates diffusion-based LLM inference via adaptive length prediction and jump-share speculative decoding, achieving 46-162x speedup over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dLLM frameworks with KV caching require periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, causing substantial inference cost and limiting speedup potential. The fixed response length in prefill introduces redundant computation, while decoding efficiency needs improvement.

Method: Proposes ODB-dLLM with dual-boundary orchestration: 1) Adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead by eliminating redundant computation from fixed response lengths, 2) dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method that reduces decoding iterations by leveraging computational characteristics of dLLMs.

Result: ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x speedup over baseline dLLM and 2.63-6.30x speedup over Fast-dLLM, while mitigating accuracy degradation present in existing acceleration frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed ODB-dLLM framework effectively addresses inefficiencies in dLLM inference through adaptive prefill optimization and specialized speculative decoding, delivering substantial speed improvements without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention for their exceptional performance and inherent potential for parallel decoding. Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.

TL;DR: A temporal consistency verification method that iteratively refines judgments through self-reflection sequences, improving mathematical reasoning accuracy across benchmarks and enabling small distilled models to outperform larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning, but existing approaches like one-round verification or multi-model debates have limitations. The authors aim to improve verification accuracy by leveraging temporal consistency in self-reflection sequences.

Method: A new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on previous assessments, using consistency in sequences of self-reflection actions rather than one-round verification or multi-model debates.

Result: Consistent performance improvements across Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K benchmarks. When applied to DeepSeek R1 distilled models, 7B/8B models outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. The distilled 14B model achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1.

Conclusion: Temporal consistency verification through iterative self-reflection significantly improves mathematical reasoning verification accuracy and enables smaller distilled models to achieve performance comparable to or better than much larger models.

Abstract: Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: fMRI-LM is a foundational model that bridges fMRI brain imaging with language through neural tokenization, joint modeling with LLMs, and multi-task instruction tuning, enabling semantic understanding of brain activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal LLMs handle images, audio, and video, extending this capability to brain imaging remains unexplored. Bridging fMRI with language is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and develop cross-modal brain representations.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Neural tokenizer maps fMRI to discrete tokens in language-consistent space; 2) Pretrained LLM adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text; 3) Multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning for high-level semantic understanding. Overcomes lack of fMRI-text pairs by constructing descriptive corpus translating imaging features to structured textual descriptors.

Result: fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance across various benchmarks, adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned universal model for fMRI understanding.

Conclusion: fMRI-LM successfully bridges fMRI and language through a scalable three-stage framework, enabling semantic understanding of brain activity and establishing foundation for cross-modal brain representations aligned with language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.

### [245] [On the Role of Preference Variance in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13022)
*Jiacheng Guo,Zihao Li,Jiahao Qiu,Yue Wu,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPO training effectiveness depends on preference variance (PVar) - prompts with higher PVar produce larger gradient updates and yield better alignment performance than random or low-PVar prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human preference data collection is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce required annotations. The paper investigates how preference variance affects DPO training effectiveness to identify more informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

Method: Established theoretical upper bound on DPO gradient norm controlled by PVar. Fine-tuned LLMs with reward model-generated preferences, evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard. Used PVar-based prompt selection with smaller reward models (1B, 3B) and validated with original human annotations from UltraFeedback dataset.

Result: Prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. Training on top 10% of prompts with highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on full dataset. PVar-based selection is robust even with smaller reward models.

Conclusion: Preference variance is crucial for identifying informative examples in DPO training. High-PVar prompts produce larger gradient updates and enable more efficient LLM alignment with fewer annotations, offering a practical approach to reduce data collection costs.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

*Tabia Tanzin Prama,Christopher M. Danforth,Peter Sheridan Dodds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with dialect translation; Sylheti-CAP framework improves translation quality for low-resource Sylheti dialect through context-aware prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong translation abilities but their effectiveness for dialectal and low-resource contexts like Sylheti (a Bangla dialect) remains underexplored, requiring systematic investigation.

Method: Evaluated 5 advanced LLMs on Bangla-Sylheti translation, then introduced Sylheti-CAP - a three-step framework embedding linguistic rulebook, dictionary (2,260 vocabulary items/idioms), and authenticity check directly into prompts.

Result: Sylheti-CAP consistently improved translation quality across models and prompting strategies, with both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirming effectiveness, reducing hallucinations, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing.

Conclusion: Sylheti-CAP establishes a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource machine translation, demonstrating that context-aware prompting can effectively address LLM limitations in dialect-specific vocabulary and linguistic nuances.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong translation abilities through prompting, even without task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in dialectal and low-resource contexts remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic investigation of LLM-based machine translation (MT) for Sylheti, a dialect of Bangla that is itself low-resource. We evaluate five advanced LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1, LLaMA 4, Grok 3, and DeepSeek V3.2) across both translation directions (Bangla $\Leftrightarrow$ Sylheti), and find that these models struggle with dialect-specific vocabulary. To address this, we introduce Sylheti-CAP (Context-Aware Prompting), a three-step framework that embeds a linguistic rulebook, a dictionary (2{,}260 core vocabulary items and idioms), and an authenticity check directly into prompts. Extensive experiments show that Sylheti-CAP consistently improves translation quality across models and prompting strategies. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm its effectiveness, while qualitative analysis reveals notable reductions in hallucinations, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing, establishing Sylheti-CAP as a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource MT.

*Sarina Xi,Vishisht Rao,Justin Payan,Nihar B. Shah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLAWS benchmark evaluates LLMs' ability to detect and localize errors in scientific papers, with GPT 5 achieving 39.1% accuracy as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exponential growth of scientific output makes error detection increasingly difficult for human reviewers, creating need for automated support systems. Despite growing use of LLMs in review systems, their error detection capabilities remain underexplored.

Method: Created FLAWS benchmark with 713 paper-error pairs by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs. Developed automated evaluation metric to measure error identification and localization. Overcame challenges of ensuring errors are well-defined, challenging, relevant, and avoiding trivial identification artifacts.

Result: Evaluated five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. GPT 5 performed best with 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10 (number of top-ranked error text candidates).

Conclusion: FLAWS provides an automated benchmark for evaluating LLMs' error detection capabilities in scientific papers. While GPT 5 shows promising performance (39.1% accuracy), there's significant room for improvement in automated error localization for scientific peer review.

Abstract: The identification and localization of errors is a core task in peer review, yet the exponential growth of scientific output has made it increasingly difficult for human reviewers to reliably detect errors given the limited pool of experts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.

### [248] [Improving Score Reliability of Multiple Choice Benchmarks with Consistency Evaluation and Altered Answer Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21860)
*Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Claudio Pinhanez,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRA (Consistency-Rebalanced Accuracy), a new metric that improves LLM evaluation on multiple-choice benchmarks by measuring response consistency using synthetically-generated questions with altered answer choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) scores for LLMs may not reflect true model reliability, as models can achieve high scores while being inconsistent in their responses. There's a need for metrics that better capture response consistency to improve evaluation reliability.

Method: CoRA uses synthetically-generated questions with altered answer choices to measure response consistency. It computes two intermediate scores: Bare-Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (BMCA) and Consistency Index (CI), then adjusts MCQA scores based on these consistency measures to produce the final CoRA metric.

Result: Evaluations across different benchmarks with diverse LLMs show that LLMs can exhibit low response consistency even with high MCQA scores. CoRA successfully scales down scores of inconsistent models, providing more reliable evaluation.

Conclusion: CoRA improves the reliability of LLM evaluation on multiple-choice benchmarks by incorporating response consistency measurements, offering a more comprehensive assessment of model performance beyond simple accuracy scores.

Abstract: In this work we present the Consistency-Rebalanced Accuracy (CoRA) metric, improving the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) scores computed on multiple choice (MC) benchmarks. Our metric explores the response consistency of the LLMs, taking advantage of synthetically-generated questions with altered answer choices. With two intermediate scores, i.e. Bare-Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (BMCA) and Consistency Index (CI), CoRA is computed by adjusting the multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) scores to better reflect the level of consistency of the LLM. We present evaluations in different benchmarks using diverse LLMs, and not only demonstrate that LLMs can present low response consistency even when they present high MCQA scores, but also that CoRA can successfully scale down the scores of inconsistent models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoWOZ-CS: A bilingual emotion-annotated customer service dialogue corpus created via controlled Wizard of Oz experiments to study emotion trajectories, annotation reliability, and predictive emotion inference in real-time support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing emotion recognition resources are out-of-domain, narrowly labeled, and focus on post-hoc detection, lacking the in-domain conversational data, rich annotations, and predictive capabilities needed for emotion-aware customer service systems.

Method: Conducted controlled Wizard of Oz experiments to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories, creating EmoWOZ-CS corpus with 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) dialogues from 179 participants across four customer service domains (aviation, e-commerce, travel, telecom).

Result: Neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are most frequent non-neutral emotions. Moderate agreement for multilabel emotions/valence, lower for arousal/dominance. Self-reports diverge from third-party labels. Successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, especially for negative targets. Forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns proves challenging.

Conclusion: WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories are effective for emotion research. EmoWOZ-CS enables benchmarking of detection and forward-looking emotion inference, highlighting the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support systems in customer service.

Abstract: Emotion-aware customer service needs in-domain conversational data, rich annotations, and predictive capabilities, but existing resources for emotion recognition are often out-of-domain, narrowly labeled, and focused on post-hoc detection. To address this, we conducted a controlled Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion. Some affective strategies (cheerfulness, gratitude) foster positive reciprocity, whereas others (apology, empathy) can also leave desire, anger, or annoyance. Temporal analysis confirms successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, most distinctly for negative targets; positive and neutral targets yield similar final valence distributions. Benchmarks highlight the difficulty of forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns, underscoring the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support.

*Karin de Langis,William Walker,Khanh Chi Le,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PreferRead dataset captures annotators' reading behaviors (focus, re-reading, skimming) during preference annotation tasks using mouse tracking, revealing relationships between reading patterns and annotation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand annotator decision-making processes beyond just final labels, capturing the cognitive dimension of how annotators read and process information during complex, subjective NLP tasks like preference annotation.

Method: Developed an annotation framework that records reading behaviors via mouse tracking, applied to preference annotation tasks to create PreferRead dataset with fine-grained reading behavior data.

Result: Annotators re-read responses in ~50% of trials (mostly their chosen option), rarely revisit prompts; re-reading correlates with higher inter-annotator agreement, while longer reading paths/times correlate with lower agreement.

Conclusion: Reading processes provide valuable cognitive insights into annotator reliability and decision-making, offering complementary dimensions to understand disagreement in subjective NLP tasks; dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: We propose an annotation approach that captures not only labels but also the reading process underlying annotators' decisions, e.g., what parts of the text they focus on, re-read or skim. Using this framework, we conduct a case study on the preference annotation task, creating a dataset PreferRead that contains fine-grained annotator reading behaviors obtained from mouse tracking. PreferRead enables detailed analysis of how annotators navigate between a prompt and two candidate responses before selecting their preference. We find that annotators re-read a response in roughly half of all trials, most often revisiting the option they ultimately choose, and rarely revisit the prompt. Reading behaviors are also significantly related to annotation outcomes: re-reading is associated with higher inter-annotator agreement, whereas long reading paths and times are associated with lower agreement. These results demonstrate that reading processes provide a complementary cognitive dimension for understanding annotator reliability, decision-making and disagreement in complex, subjective NLP tasks. Our code and data are publicly available.

*Yuxin Li,Lorraine Xu,Meng Fan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First benchmark for Chinese lyric authorship attribution with new balanced dataset and domain-specific model, showing genre-dependent performance and partial fine-tuning benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of clean, public datasets for Chinese lyric authorship attribution and establish the first cross-genre benchmark for this domain.

Method: Created new balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics across multiple genres, developed domain-specific model, compared fine-tuned model against zero-shot DeepSeek LLM inference, tested two hypotheses with two different test sets (Test1: real-world data, Test2: synthetically-augmented).

Result: Strongly confirmed Hypothesis 2: structured genres (Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than abstract genres (Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 partially supported: fine-tuning improves robustness in Test1 but offers limited gains in Test2 due to design limitations (label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, narrow genre sampling).

Conclusion: Established first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlighted importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, provided public dataset and framework. Recommendations: enlarge/diversify test sets, reduce token-level data augmentation, balance author representation, investigate domain-adaptive pretraining.

Abstract: We propose a novel study on authorship attribution for Chinese lyrics, a domain where clean, public datasets are sorely lacking. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we create a new, balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics spanning multiple genres, and (2) we develop and fine-tune a domain-specific model, comparing its performance against zero-shot inference using the DeepSeek LLM.
  We test two central hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.
  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research. We conclude with recommendations: enlarge and diversify test sets, reduce reliance on token-level data augmentation, balance author representation across genres, and investigate domain-adaptive pretraining as a pathway for improved attribution performance.

*Pamela D. Rivière,Sean Trott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers develop a pipeline to study how attention heads in Transformer language models develop specialized patterns for word sense disambiguation, finding that larger models have more robust disambiguation mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-attention mechanisms in Transformer LMs develop specialized functions for interpretable computations, specifically focusing on word sense disambiguation as a test case.

Method: A developmental approach using Pythia LM checkpoints to identify inflection points in disambiguation performance, analyze heads whose attention patterns correlate with performance, stress-test robustness to stimulus perturbations, and conduct causal ablation experiments.

Result: Found that disambiguation involves multiple mechanisms with varying sensitivity to cue position and part-of-speech; 14M models show limited robustness while 410M models contain heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior; ablation of target heads impairs disambiguation, especially in 14M.

Conclusion: Word sense disambiguation benefits from a constellation of attention mechanisms, with larger models developing more robust disambiguation behavior, highlighting the value of developmental perspectives in probing LM mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite an in-principle understanding of self-attention matrix operations in Transformer language models (LMs), it remains unclear precisely how these operations map onto interpretable computations or functions--and how or when individual attention heads develop specialized attention patterns. Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a "developmental" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms.

*Yann Le Beux,Oluchi Audu,Oche D. Ankeli,Dhananjay Balakrishnan,Melissah Weya,Marie D. Ralaiarinosy,Ignatius Ezeani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriStereo is the first African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework that addresses Western bias in AI by collecting and validating 5,000+ stereotype-antistereotype pairs from Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria to measure and mitigate cultural bias in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI bias evaluation benchmarks predominantly reflect Western perspectives, leaving African contexts underrepresented and enabling harmful stereotypes in applications across various domains. This gap in representation and evaluation creates risks for deploying biased AI systems in African contexts.

Method: The researchers used community-engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria to collect 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. They employed few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation to augment the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Validation involved semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers.

Result: Evaluation of language models revealed that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p ≤ 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes. Bias was particularly pronounced across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models showed weaker bias, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations.

Conclusion: AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies. The framework addresses the critical need for non-Western perspectives in AI bias evaluation.

Abstract: Existing AI bias evaluation benchmarks largely reflect Western perspectives, leaving African contexts underrepresented and enabling harmful stereotypes in applications across various domains. To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies.

Abstract: Academic research generates diverse data sources, and as researchers increasingly use machine learning to assist research tasks, a crucial question arises: Can we build a unified data interface to support the development of machine learning models for various academic tasks? Models trained on such a unified interface can better support human researchers throughout the research process, eventually accelerating knowledge discovery. In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables. ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements. Our experiments across six academic tasks demonstrate that combining cross-source and multi-modal information enables a broader range of tasks, while incorporating graph structures consistently improves performance over baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness of ResearchArcade and its potential to advance research progress.

*Rochana Chaturvedi,Yue Zhou,Andrew Boyd,Brian T. Layden,Mudassir Rashid,Lu Cheng,Ali Cinar,Barbara Di Eugenio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two complementary methods for temporal risk prediction from clinical notes: HiTGNN (hierarchical temporal graph neural network) for fine-grained patient trajectory modeling, and ReVeAL (lightweight test-time framework) for distilling LLM reasoning into smaller verifier models, applied to Type 2 Diabetes screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich temporal information missing from structured EHR data, but present NLP challenges including long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. Leveraging clinical notes for predictive modeling can enable timely identification of chronic diseases.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) HiTGNN - hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. 2) ReVeAL - lightweight test-time framework that distills reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models.

Result: Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes using temporally realistic cohorts from private and public hospital corpora. HiTGNN achieves highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Ablations confirm value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address core NLP challenges in clinical note analysis for risk prediction. HiTGNN provides superior predictive performance with fine-grained temporal modeling, while ReVeAL offers lightweight reasoning distillation. Both approaches work synergistically for accurate, privacy-preserving, and equitable chronic disease screening from longitudinal clinical notes.

Abstract: Clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) capture rich temporal information on events, clinician reasoning, and lifestyle factors often missing from structured data. Leveraging them for predictive modeling can be impactful for timely identification of chronic diseases. However, they present core natural language processing (NLP) challenges: long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. We present two complementary methods for temporally and contextually grounded risk prediction from longitudinal notes. First, we introduce HiTGNN, a hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. Second, we propose ReVeAL, a lightweight, test-time framework that distills the reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models. Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using temporally realistic cohorts curated from private and public hospital corpora, HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups.

TL;DR: LLMs predict belief change in online discourse using psychological features, with epistemic emotion and willingness to share as top predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional psychological models of belief revision focus on face-to-face interactions, but social media requires new models to capture belief revision at scale in online text-based discourse.

Method: Hybrid approach using LLMs to generate ratings of psychological features from literature, building a random forest classification model to predict whether a message will result in belief change.

Result: Of eight features tested, epistemic emotion and willingness to share were the top-ranking predictors of belief change in the model.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into persuasive message characteristics and demonstrate how LLMs can enhance persuasion models based on psychological theory, with applications in online influence detection, misinformation mitigation, and measuring narrative effectiveness.

Abstract: Traditional psychological models of belief revision focus on face-to-face interactions, but with the rise of social media, more effective models are needed to capture belief revision at scale, in this rich text-based online discourse. Here, we use a hybrid approach, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to develop a model that predicts successful persuasion using features derived from psychological experiments.
  Our approach leverages LLM generated ratings of features previously examined in the literature to build a random forest classification model that predicts whether a message will result in belief change. Of the eight features tested, \textit{epistemic emotion} and \textit{willingness to share} were the top-ranking predictors of belief change in the model. Our findings provide insights into the characteristics of persuasive messages and demonstrate how LLMs can enhance models of successful persuasion based on psychological theory. Given these insights, this work has broader applications in fields such as online influence detection and misinformation mitigation, as well as measuring the effectiveness of online narratives.

### [257] [Bridging the Modality Gap by Similarity Standardization with Pseudo-Positive Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22141)
*Shuhei Yamashita,Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a similarity standardization method using pseudo data construction to address the modality gap in cross-modality retrieval, achieving significant performance improvements on multi-modal QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models suffer from modality gap issues where similarity scores differ in scale between text and image modalities, hindering accurate cross-modality retrieval. Existing solutions require manually labeled data for fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes similarity standardization with pseudo data construction: 1) Compute mean and variance of similarity scores between queries and their paired data for each modality, 2) Use modality-specific statistics to standardize all similarity scores to a common scale, 3) Statistics calculated from pseudo pairs constructed by retrieving highest cosine similarity candidates for each query.

Result: Method evaluated across seven VLMs using MMQA and WebQA benchmarks. Achieves average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA for cross-modality retrieval. Outperforms E5-V which uses image captioning to address modality gap.

Conclusion: The proposed similarity standardization method effectively bridges the modality gap in cross-modality retrieval without requiring manually labeled data, significantly improving retrieval performance across different vision-language models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled effective cross-modality retrieval. However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities. Compared to E5-V, which addresses the modality gap through image captioning, we confirm that our method more effectively bridges the modality gap.

### [258] [C$^2$DLM: Causal Concept-Guided Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22146)
*Kairong Han,Nuanqiao Shan,Ziyu Zhao,Zijing Hu,Xinpeng Dong,Junjian Ye,Lujia Pan,Fei Wu,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C²DLM is a causal concept-guided diffusion language model that improves reasoning by incorporating concept-level causal graphs to guide attention mechanisms, addressing limitations in both autoregressive and diffusion language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Both autoregressive and diffusion language models have insufficient reasoning capabilities. Autoregressive models use rigid left-to-right token prediction that doesn't match natural language's flexible causal structures, while diffusion models use fully connected attention that ignores causal order entirely. Human reasoning relies on causal knowledge, so the authors aim to bridge this gap.

Method: C²DLM starts from diffusion language models' fully connected attention, obtains a concept-level causal graph from a teacher model, then explicitly guides attention to learn causal relationships between concepts. This approach focuses on causal relationships while avoiding interference from difficult subgoals involving causal inversion.

Result: C²DLM improves 12% with about 3.2 times training speedup in the COT-OrderPerturb task, and achieves an average gain of 1.31% across six downstream reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed C²DLM successfully incorporates causal knowledge into language modeling, improving reasoning capabilities and training efficiency compared to existing autoregressive and diffusion language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models and Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) constitute the two principal paradigms of large language models. However, both paradigms suffer from insufficient reasoning capabilities. Human reasoning inherently relies on causal knowledge and thought, which are reflected in natural language. But in the AR paradigm, language is modeled as next token prediction (a strictly left-to-right, token-by-token order), whereas natural language itself exhibits more flexible causal structures. In the DLM paradigm, the attention mechanism is fully connected, which entirely disregards causal order. To fill this gap, we propose a \underline{\textbf{C}}ausal \underline{\textbf{C}}oncept-Guided \underline{\textbf{D}}iffusion \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage \underline{\textbf{M}}odel (C$^2$DLM). Starting from DLM's fully connected attention, C$^2$DLM first obtains a concept-level causal graph from the teacher model, and then explicitly guides attention to learn causal relationships between concepts. By focusing on causal relationships and avoiding interference from difficult subgoals involving causal inversion, C$^2$DLM improves 12\% with about 3.2 times training speedup in the COT-OrderPerturb task, and achieves an average gain of 1.31\% across six downstream reasoning tasks.

*Sepyan Purnama Kristanto,Lutfi Hakim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid ensemble detector combining three complementary AI text detection methods achieves 94.2% accuracy with 35% reduction in false positives on academic text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of LLMs blurs human-machine authorship lines, creating risks for academic integrity. Existing detectors have poor generalization and high false positive rates, especially on academic text.

Method: A hybrid ensemble fusing three paradigms: 1) RoBERTa-based transformer for semantic features, 2) GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, 3) statistical linguistic feature analyzer for stylometric patterns. Uses optimized weighted voting with ensemble weights learned on probability simplex to maximize F1-score.

Result: Achieves 94.2% accuracy and AUC of 0.978 on 30,000-document corpus, with 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text. Shows low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42).

Conclusion: The hybrid ensemble approach yields a more reliable and ethically responsible detector for real-world deployment in education and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has blurred the line between human and machine authorship, creating practical risks for academic integrity and information reliability. Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text. This yields a more reliable and ethically responsible detector for real-world deployment in education and other high-stakes domains.

### [260] [Lips-Jaw and Tongue-Jaw Articulatory Tradeoff in DYNARTmo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22155)
*Bernd J. Kröger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model, successfully simulates articulatory tradeoffs between primary and secondary articulators (lips-jaw and tongue-jaw coordination) using simplified first-order task-space specifications, reproducing empirically observed patterns in CV syllables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how a computationally simplified dynamic articulatory model can account for articulatory tradeoffs and coordination between primary and secondary articulators, particularly focusing on lips-jaw and tongue-jaw interactions during speech production.

Method: DYNARTmo uses first-order task-space gesture specifications (similar to articulatory phonology) with a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. The model simulates CV syllables varying by place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/) to examine jaw displacement patterns.

Result: The model reproduces empirically attested articulatory patterns: jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. It generates realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture articulatory tradeoffs and synergies across consonant-vowel combinations.

Conclusion: Even with computationally simplified assumptions (first-order rather than full second-order biomechanics), DYNARTmo can successfully generate realistic articulatory movement patterns and capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy, demonstrating the viability of simplified dynamic models for speech production research.

Abstract: This paper investigates how the dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo accounts for articulatory tradeoffs between primary and secondary articulators, with a focus on lips-jaw and tongue-jaw coordination. While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models struggle to self-refine their own responses without guidance, achieving only modest improvements, but can leverage targeted feedback to reach near-perfect performance within five turns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can self-refine their responses, especially given increasing real-world user interactions involving refinement requests, and to address the gap where prior studies focused on verifiable tasks rather than open-ended queries with varying feedback.

Method: Introduces RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains with a checklist-based evaluation framework. Evaluates two refinement modes: guided refinement (with natural language feedback) and self-refinement (without guidance). Tests frontier models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5.

Result: In self-refinement, frontier LMs achieve modest baseline scores (31.3% for Gemini 2.5 Pro, 29.1% for GPT-5) with minimal improvement across iterations. In guided refinement, both proprietary and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns.

Conclusion: Frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine incorrect responses without guidance, but can effectively use targeted feedback. RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress in LM refinement capabilities.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) self-refine their own responses? This question is increasingly relevant as a wide range of real-world user interactions involve refinement requests. However, prior studies have largely tested LMs' refinement abilities on verifiable tasks such as competition math or symbolic reasoning with simplified scaffolds, whereas users often pose open-ended queries and provide varying degrees of feedback on what they desire. The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress.

*Lukas Struppek,Dominik Hintersdorf,Hannah Struppek,Daniel Neider,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: F-CoT reduces LLM reasoning tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy by structuring input to separate information extraction from reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs leads to excessive token use and high inference latency due to verbose reasoning traces. Existing efficiency approaches focus on model-centric interventions, but there's a need for simpler, training-free alternatives.

Method: Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT) separates information extraction from reasoning. It first organizes essential information from queries into concise, structured context, then guides models to reason exclusively over this structured context, preventing attention to irrelevant details.

Result: On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: Structured input serves as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning, demonstrating that training-free, input-centric approaches can achieve significant efficiency gains without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Recent large language models achieve strong reasoning performance by generating detailed chain-of-thought traces, but this often leads to excessive token use and high inference latency. Existing efficiency approaches typically focus on model-centric interventions, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, to reduce verbosity. In contrast, we propose a training-free, input-centric approach. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT. These results highlight structured input as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RuCo-C is a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation in text-to-SQL tasks, using interpretable critiques without human intervention and integrating densified reward feedback through progressive exploration in RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-SQL evaluation and reward mechanisms are bottlenecked by reliance on costly manual gold SQL annotations and coarse-grained binary execution outcomes in RL methods, which overlook detailed structural and semantic errors.

Method: Proposes RuCo-C framework that: 1) automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation linked to interpretable critiques, and 2) integrates densified reward feedback through a "progressive exploration" strategy during RL training that dynamically adjusts rewards.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RuCo-C outperforms existing methods in text-to-SQL evaluation, yielding significant performance gains.

Conclusion: RuCo-C addresses critical bottlenecks in text-to-SQL evaluation by providing fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation with interpretable critiques and improved RL training through densified reward feedback, achieving superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, a pivotal natural language processing (NLP) task that converts textual queries into executable SQL, has seen substantial progress in recent years. However, existing evaluation and reward mechanisms used to train and assess the text-to-SQL models remain a critical bottleneck. Current approaches heavily rely on manually annotated gold SQL queries, which are costly to produce and impractical for large-scale evaluation. More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a "progressive exploration" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RuCo-C outperforms existing methods in text-to-SQL evaluation, yielding significant performance gains.

TL;DR: This paper proposes three token-level probability estimation methods to extract interpretable confidence scores from generative LLMs for multi-label content safety classification, addressing the lack of direct class probabilities in models like LLaMA Guard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative language models like LLaMA Guard lack direct class-level probabilities, which hinders confidence assessment, performance interpretation, dynamic threshold setting for content moderation, and fine-grained error analysis in multi-label safety classification tasks.

Method: The research proposes and evaluates three novel token-level probability estimation approaches to bridge the gap between generative LLMs and interpretable confidence scores for multi-label classification.

Result: Experiments on a synthetically generated, rigorously annotated dataset show that leveraging token logits significantly improves the interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers, enabling more nuanced content safety moderation.

Conclusion: Token-level probability estimation enhances model interpretability and accuracy for generative classifiers in content safety applications, with demonstrated generalizability across different instruction-tuned models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of deriving interpretable confidence scores from generative language models (LLMs) when applied to multi-label content safety classification. While models like LLaMA Guard are effective for identifying unsafe content and its categories, their generative architecture inherently lacks direct class-level probabilities, which hinders model confidence assessment and performance interpretation. This limitation complicates the setting of dynamic thresholds for content moderation and impedes fine-grained error analysis. This research proposes and evaluates three novel token-level probability estimation approaches to bridge this gap. The aim is to enhance model interpretability and accuracy, and evaluate the generalizability of this framework across different instruction-tuned models. Through extensive experimentation on a synthetically generated, rigorously annotated dataset, it is demonstrated that leveraging token logits significantly improves the interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers, enabling more nuanced content safety moderation.

TL;DR: DistilBERT achieves 94.8% accuracy for sentiment analysis on Shopee reviews, offering optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency with 55% faster computation than BERT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The massive volume of consumer reviews on e-commerce platforms like Shopee requires automated sentiment analysis, as manual analysis is inefficient for extracting customer satisfaction insights from millions of daily reviews.

Method: Used DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased) for sentiment classification on approximately one million preprocessed English Shopee reviews, with evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, compared against BERT and SVM benchmarks.

Result: DistilBERT achieved 94.8% accuracy (slightly below BERT's 95.3% but significantly above SVM's 90.2%) with computation time reduced by more than 55% compared to BERT.

Conclusion: DistilBERT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale sentiment analysis on e-commerce platforms where computational resources and speed are important considerations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital commerce has led to the accumulation of a massive number of consumer reviews on online platforms. Shopee, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, receives millions of product reviews every day containing valuable information regarding customer satisfaction and preferences. Manual analysis of these reviews is inefficient, thus requiring a computational approach such as sentiment analysis. This study examines the use of DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer-based deep learning model, for sentiment classification on Shopee product reviews. The dataset used consists of approximately one million English-language reviews that have been preprocessed and trained using the distilbert-base-uncased model. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and compared against benchmark models such as BERT and SVM. The results show that DistilBERT achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, slightly below BERT (95.3%) but significantly higher than SVM (90.2%), with computation time reduced by more than 55%. These findings demonstrate that DistilBERT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for large scale sentiment analysis on e-commerce platforms.

*Bakhtawar Abdalla,Rebwar Mala Nabi,Hassan Eshkiki,Fabio Caraffini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First Kurdish Sorani NER dataset with 64,563 tokens, showing classical CRF models outperform neural BiLSTM in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of NLP resources for low-resource languages like Kurdish Sorani and balance inclusivity in NLP techniques by creating the first named entity recognition dataset for this underrepresented language.

Method: Created a Kurdish Sorani NER dataset with 64,563 annotated tokens, developed tools for NER tasks, and performed comparative analysis using both classic machine learning models (including CRF) and neural systems (BiLSTM-based models).

Result: CRF models achieved F1-score of 0.825, significantly outperforming BiLSTM-based models (0.706), challenging the assumption that neural approaches are always superior in NLP tasks.

Conclusion: Simpler classical frameworks like CRF can outperform neural architectures in low-resource settings, suggesting computational efficiency and classical methods remain valuable for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: This work contributes towards balancing the inclusivity and global applicability of natural language processing techniques by proposing the first 'name entity recognition' dataset for Kurdish Sorani, a low-resource and under-represented language, that consists of 64,563 annotated tokens. It also provides a tool for facilitating this task in this and many other languages and performs a thorough comparative analysis, including classic machine learning models and neural systems. The results obtained challenge established assumptions about the advantage of neural approaches within the context of NLP. Conventional methods, in particular CRF, obtain F1-scores of 0.825, outperforming the results of BiLSTM-based models (0.706) significantly. These findings indicate that simpler and more computationally efficient classical frameworks can outperform neural architectures in low-resource settings.

*Srivarshinee Sridhar,Raghav Kaushik Ravi,Kripabandhu Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show structured sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text, with epistemic cues progressively encoded in deeper layers, revealing how uncertainty is internally represented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in clinical settings where sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty affects diagnostic interpretation, but little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models.

Method: Created a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality and proposed Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues.

Result: LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability for clinical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, where sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty can influence diagnostic interpretation and decision-making. Yet little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models. Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers. These findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability.

*Isabel Gonçalves,Paulo Cavalin,Claudio Pinhanez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic investigation of performance variations in fine-tuned translators for Indigenous languages reveals that differences between languages, not training factors, are the primary cause of performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works reported substantially different performances with translators created using similar methodology and data for ultra-low resource languages, creating uncertainty about what factors actually influence translation quality.

Method: Systematically explored possible causes of performance differences by studying: different cleaning procedures, limitations of pre-trained models, size of base models, and size of training datasets. Used two Brazilian Indigenous languages with related but structurally different characteristics, studying both translation directions.

Result: Found none or very limited influence from the training factors studied (cleaning procedures, model limitations, base model size, training dataset size).

Conclusion: Differences between languages themselves play a significant role in the ability to produce translators by fine-tuning pre-trained models, suggesting language-specific characteristics are more important than previously considered training factors.

Abstract: Finetuning pre-trained language models with small amounts of data is a commonly-used method to create translators for ultra-low resource languages such as endangered Indigenous languages. However, previous works have reported substantially different performances with translators created using similar methodology and data. In this work we systematically explored possible causes of the performance difference, aiming to determine whether it was a product of different cleaning procedures, limitations of the pre-trained models, the size of the base model, or the size of the training dataset, studying both directions of translation. Our studies, using two Brazilian Indigenous languages, related but with significant structural linguistic characteristics, indicated none or very limited influence from those training factors, suggesting differences between languages may play a significant role in the ability to produce translators by fine-tuning pre-trained models.

*Katia Vendrame,Bolaji Yusuf,Santosh Kesiraju,Šimon Sedláček,Oldřich Plchot,Jan Černocký*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes joint training on spoken DST data and textual DST data from other domains to achieve cross-domain generalization without requiring spoken training data for target domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end spoken DST faces challenges with speech input and data scarcity. While speech foundation encoders + LLMs show strong performance, they struggle with cross-domain generalization and require annotated spoken DST data for each domain, which is costly and difficult to collect. Textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains.

Method: Joint training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains to enable cross-domain generalization without requiring spoken training data from target domains.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method achieves good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from target domains.

Conclusion: Joint training on spoken and textual DST data enables effective cross-domain generalization, addressing the data scarcity problem in spoken DST by leveraging more readily available textual data from other domains.

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) is made difficult by the tandem of having to handle speech input and data scarcity. Combining speech foundation encoders and large language models has been proposed in recent work as to alleviate some of this difficulty. Although this approach has been shown to result in strong spoken DST models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic multi-turn DST, it struggles to generalize across domains and requires annotated spoken DST training data for each domain of interest. However, collecting such data for every target domain is both costly and difficult. Noting that textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains, in this work, we propose jointly training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains as a way to achieve cross-domain generalization. We conduct experiments which show the efficacy of our proposed method for getting good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from the target domains.

Result: Fine-tuned compact models (e.g., bge-base-en-v1.5) achieve superior accuracy-latency-cost trade-off compared to larger models. A/B user study shows RAG-enhanced assistants improve perceived helpfulness, truthfulness, and satisfaction over general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: Provides insights for deploying efficient, domain-aligned LLM-based assistants in industrial HIL environments, challenging the notion that bigger models are always better and demonstrating practical benefits of RAG-enhanced systems.

Abstract: Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing is essential for automotive validation but suffers from fragmented and underutilized test artifacts. This paper presents HIL-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system integrating domain-adapted large language models (LLMs) with semantic retrieval. HIL-GPT leverages embedding fine-tuning using a domain-specific dataset constructed via heuristic mining and LLM-assisted synthesis, combined with vector indexing for scalable, traceable test case and requirement retrieval. Experiments show that fine-tuned compact models, such as \texttt{bge-base-en-v1.5}, achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost compared to larger models, challenging the notion that bigger is always better. An A/B user study further confirms that RAG-enhanced assistants improve perceived helpfulness, truthfulness, and satisfaction over general-purpose LLMs. These findings provide insights for deploying efficient, domain-aligned LLM-based assistants in industrial HIL environments.

*Guilherme Sousa,Rinaldo Lima,Cassia Trojahn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can perform ontology matching directly on ontology modules, and fine-tuning with synthetic data improves zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in ontology matching pipelines, but there's a need to understand their direct matching capabilities and improve performance through fine-tuning, especially given the scarcity of reference alignments for training.

Method: Proposes a method with search space reduction to select relevant ontology subsets, automatic prompt construction, and a novel LLM-based approach to generate synthetic datasets of ontology submodule pairs with reference alignments for fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluation on Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets shows that LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic data outperform non-fine-tuned base models in ontology matching tasks.

Conclusion: The key contribution is a strategy combining automatic dataset generation with fine-tuning to effectively adapt LLMs for ontology matching, demonstrating improved performance over base models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various components of Ontology Matching pipelines. This paper investigates the capability of LLMs to perform ontology matching directly on ontology modules and generate the corresponding alignments. Furthermore, it is explored how a dedicated fine-tuning strategy can enhance the model's matching performance in a zero-shot setting. The proposed method incorporates a search space reduction technique to select relevant subsets from both source and target ontologies, which are then used to automatically construct prompts. Recognizing the scarcity of reference alignments for training, a novel LLM-based approach is introduced for generating a synthetic dataset. This process creates a corpus of ontology submodule pairs and their corresponding reference alignments, specifically designed to fine-tune an LLM for the ontology matching task. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets from the OAEI complex track. The results demonstrate that the LLM fine-tuned on the synthetically generated data exhibits superior performance compared to the non-fine-tuned base model. The key contribution is a strategy that combines automatic dataset generation with fine-tuning to effectively adapt LLMs for ontology matching tasks.

*Kanchon Gharami,Quazi Sarwar Muhtaseem,Deepti Gupta,Lavanya Elluri,Shafika Showkat Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a large-scale transliteration dataset for Hindi and Bengali (1.8M and 1M pairs respectively) and pre-trains a multilingual seq2seq LLM to address Romanized script challenges in South Asian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual models struggle with Romanized scripts used widely in South Asian social media, and existing transliteration datasets for Indo-Aryan languages lack diversity in pronunciation/spelling variations, code-mixed data for LLM training, and low-resource adaptation capabilities.

Method: Created a novel transliteration dataset for Hindi and Bengali, then pre-trained a custom multilingual sequence-to-sequence large language model based on Marian architecture using this dataset.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over existing models in terms of BLEU and CER metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model successfully address the research gap in Romanized script transliteration for Indo-Aryan languages, enhancing NLP task performance for these widely spoken languages.

Abstract: The development of robust transliteration techniques to enhance the effectiveness of transforming Romanized scripts into native scripts is crucial for Natural Language Processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, speech recognition, information retrieval, and intelligent personal assistants. Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs. In addition to that, we pre-train a custom multilingual seq2seq LLM based on Marian architecture using the developed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing relevant models in terms of BLEU and CER metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs for psychotherapy by using them to summarize motivational interviewing dialogues and assessing their performance against expert annotations using the MITI framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show potential but have limitations in sensitivity, factual accuracy, empathy consistency, bias, hallucinations, and understanding human complexity, especially in low-resource sensitive domains like psychology.

Method: Mixed-methods approach using LLMs to generate MI dialogue summaries, two-stage annotation scheme based on MITI framework components, multi-class classification tasks with progressive prompting (one-shot and few-shot), and comparison against expert-annotated ground truth.

Result: Results provide insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate semantic drift in therapeutic settings.

Conclusion: Contributes to MI community with high-quality annotated dataset addressing data scarcity, and provides critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential across both general and domain-specific tasks. However, there is a growing concern regarding their lack of sensitivity, factual incorrectness in responses, inconsistent expressions of empathy, bias, hallucinations, and overall inability to capture the depth and complexity of human understanding, especially in low-resource and sensitive domains such as psychology. To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift" in therapeutic settings. Our work contributes not only to the MI community by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to address data scarcity in low-resource domains but also critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy.

*Yuya Ishihara,Atsushi Keyaki,Hiroaki Yamada,Ryutaro Ohara,Mihoko Sumida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes design requirements for a RAG-based LLM system to support Japanese medical litigation by replacing human expert commissioners while ensuring strict compliance with legal norms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an AI system that can substitute for human expert commissioners (physicians, architects, etc.) in Japanese litigation procedures while maintaining strict adherence to legal norms, particularly addressing the challenge of replacing specialized human knowledge with AI in legally constrained environments.

Method: The paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system with three key requirements: (1) retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to disputed issues following the principle prohibiting private knowledge use, (2) generated responses must originate from and remain faithful to the RAG-provided context, and (3) retrieval must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues.

Result: The paper presents a design framework for a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies the three legal compliance requirements for supporting Japanese medical litigation procedures, though specific implementation results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: A RAG-based LLM system can potentially support Japanese medical litigation by replacing human expert commissioners if designed with specific legal compliance requirements, particularly regarding knowledge retrieval, response faithfulness, and temporal relevance of referenced information.

Abstract: This study discusses the essential components that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM system should possess in order to support Japanese medical litigation procedures complying with legal norms. In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand. This paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies these requirements.

Abstract: We introduce JBE-QA, a Japanese Bar Exam Question-Answering dataset to evaluate large language models' legal knowledge. Derived from the multiple-choice (tanto-shiki) section of the Japanese bar exam (2015-2024), JBE-QA provides the first comprehensive benchmark for Japanese legal-domain evaluation of LLMs. It covers the Civil Code, the Penal Code, and the Constitution, extending beyond the Civil Code focus of prior Japanese resources. Each question is decomposed into independent true/false judgments with structured contextual fields. The dataset contains 3,464 items with balanced labels. We evaluate 26 LLMs, including proprietary, open-weight, Japanese-specialised, and reasoning models.

*Anh Nguyen,Stefan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LED-WM improves policy generalization from language-conditioned world models without planning or expert demonstrations by using attention to ground language to observation entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents need to understand dynamics-descriptive language (how the environment behaves) rather than just task instructions for effective human-agent interaction. Existing methods either don't generalize to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions like tolerable planning latency or expert demonstrations.

Method: Proposes LED-WM (Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model) built on DreamerV3, featuring an observation encoder with attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. Uses model-based RL where world model is trained through environment interaction and policy learned from model without planning or demonstrations.

Result: Policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to baselines in MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM environments. Also demonstrates policy improvement through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.

Conclusion: LED-WM enables better policy generalization from language-conditioned world models without relying on planning or expert demonstrations, advancing agent understanding of dynamics-descriptive language for human-agent interaction.

Abstract: To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying "what to do". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.

TL;DR: An iterative framework using LLM, T2IM, and MLLM to generate and evaluate idiom-based visual puns, creating a benchmark dataset and comparing performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study idiom-based visual puns and develop an automated system for generating images that align an idiom's literal and figurative meanings, enabling systematic evaluation of multimodal AI capabilities.

Method: Iterative framework coordinating LLM, T2IM, and MLLM: generates detailed visual prompts from idioms, synthesizes images, infers idioms from images, and refines prompts until recognition succeeds or step limit reached.

Result: Created dataset of 1,000 visual pun images with paired prompts; experiments show MLLM choice is primary performance driver (GPT highest, Gemini follows, Gemma competitive), while Claude performs best for prompt generation among LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework enables automatic generation and evaluation of idiom-based visual puns, provides benchmark dataset, and reveals MLLM selection as crucial factor for performance, with some open-source models competing with closed models.

Abstract: We study idiom-based visual puns--images that align an idiom's literal and figurative meanings--and present an iterative framework that coordinates a large language model (LLM), a text-to-image model (T2IM), and a multimodal LLM (MLLM) for automatic generation and evaluation. Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding. Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models. On the LLM side, Claude attains the strongest average performance for prompt generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLy is a training-free speculative decoding method that uses a two-tier verification mechanism to accept semantically valid draft tokens, achieving 2.81-5.07x speedup while maintaining >99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods have high inference latency due to autoregressive generation, discard semantically valid continuations through strict exact-match verification, and suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: 1) entropy-level gate identifies whether tokens allow multiple plausible alternatives, 2) token-level deferred window distinguishes genuine errors from semantically correct variants. Also includes multi-level acceleration strategy for both target and draft models.

Result: Achieves average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on 405B variant while preserving >99% of target model's accuracy. Outperforms training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: FLy provides an effective training-free speculative decoding approach that generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter tuning, maintaining high accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to their autoregressive generation. Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant. Notably, on out-of-domain datasets, our method remains highly effective and outperforms the training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x.

Conclusion: Attention-based token encoders serve as robust, architecture-centric foundations for veracity tasks, effectively isolating Transformer contributions from classifier complexity in fake news detection.

Abstract: This paper investigates fake news detection as a downstream evaluation of Transformer representations, benchmarking encoder-only and decoder-only pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL) as frozen embedders paired with lightweight classifiers. Through controlled preprocessing comparing pooling versus padding and neural versus linear heads, results demonstrate that contextual self-attention encodings consistently transfer effectively. BERT embeddings combined with logistic regression outperform neural baselines on LIAR dataset splits, while analyses of sequence length and aggregation reveal robustness to truncation and advantages from simple max or average pooling. This work positions attention-based token encoders as robust, architecture-centric foundations for veracity tasks, isolating Transformer contributions from classifier complexity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShoppingComp is a challenging real-world benchmark for evaluating LLM shopping agents on product retrieval, report generation, and safety-critical decision making, revealing significant limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment of LLM-powered shopping agents by creating a rigorous evaluation framework that tests core capabilities with authentic shopping needs and verifiable real products.

Method: Created a benchmark with 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios curated by 35 experts, focusing on complex real-world shopping situations with guaranteed real products and easy verifiability, adding product safety hazard identification as a novel evaluation dimension.

Result: Current LLMs perform poorly on ShoppingComp, with state-of-the-art models achieving low performance (11.22% for GPT-5, 3.92% for Gemini-2.5-Flash), making critical errors like failing to identify unsafe product usage and falling for promotional misinformation.

Conclusion: ShoppingComp establishes a new standard for advancing reliable and practical e-commerce agents by revealing substantial limitations in current LLMs and highlighting the gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment requirements.

Abstract: We present ShoppingComp, a challenging real-world benchmark for rigorously evaluating LLM-powered shopping agents on three core capabilities: precise product retrieval, expert-level report generation, and safety critical decision making. Unlike prior e-commerce benchmarks, ShoppingComp introduces highly complex tasks under the principle of guaranteeing real products and ensuring easy verifiability, adding a novel evaluation dimension for identifying product safety hazards alongside recommendation accuracy and report quality. The benchmark comprises 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios, curated by 35 experts to reflect authentic shopping needs. Results reveal stark limitations of current LLMs: even state-of-the-art models achieve low performance (e.g., 11.22% for GPT-5, 3.92% for Gemini-2.5-Flash). These findings highlight a substantial gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment, where LLMs make critical errors such as failure to identify unsafe product usage or falling for promotional misinformation, leading to harmful recommendations. ShoppingComp fills the gap and thus establishes a new standard for advancing reliable and practical agents in e-commerce.

*Dong Nguyen,Laura Rosseel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares human and LLM perceptions of spelling variation in online English writing, finding strong correlations but notable differences in distribution and variation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spelling variation (like "funnnn" vs "fun") influences social perception of texts and writers (formality, carefulness, age). The researchers want to understand how well LLMs align with human perceptions of these social attributes in online writing.

Method: Using sociolinguistic methodology, the study compares LLM and human ratings on three key social attributes of spelling variation: formality, carefulness, and age. They analyze correlations between human and LLM ratings and examine distribution patterns across different types of spelling variation.

Result: The study finds generally strong correlations between human and LLM ratings of spelling variation's social attributes. However, notable differences emerge when analyzing rating distributions and comparing different types of spelling variation.

Conclusion: While LLMs show strong alignment with human perceptions of spelling variation's social attributes, there are meaningful differences that warrant further investigation, particularly regarding distribution patterns and variation types.

Abstract: Spelling variation (e.g. funnnn vs. fun) can influence the social perception of texts and their writers: we often have various associations with different forms of writing (is the text informal? does the writer seem young?). In this study, we focus on the social perception of spelling variation in online writing in English and study to what extent this perception is aligned between humans and large language models (LLMs). Building on sociolinguistic methodology, we compare LLM and human ratings on three key social attributes of spelling variation (formality, carefulness, age). We find generally strong correlations in the ratings between humans and LLMs. However, notable differences emerge when we analyze the distribution of ratings and when comparing between different types of spelling variation.

*Paulo J. N. Pinto,Armando J. Pinho,Diogo Pratas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tree-based ML models with engineered features achieve 76.7% century-scale and 26.1% decade-scale accuracy for dating English texts across 5 centuries, offering interpretable alternative to neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate dating of historical texts is essential for organizing and interpreting cultural heritage collections, requiring interpretable methods that can handle temporal classification across centuries.

Method: Uses interpretable tree-based ML models with five feature categories: compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features to predict temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries.

Result: Achieved 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines. Under relaxed precision: 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. Feature importance shows distance features and lexical structure as most informative.

Conclusion: Tree-based models with engineered features provide scalable, interpretable alternative to neural architectures for historical text dating, with the 19th century identified as a linguistic pivot point across feature domains.

Abstract: Accurately dating historical texts is essential for organizing and interpreting cultural heritage collections. This article addresses temporal text classification using interpretable, feature-engineered tree-based machine learning models. We integrate five feature categories - compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features - to predict the temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries. Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. The final model exhibits strong ranking capabilities with AUCROC up to 94.8% and AUPRC up to 83.3%, and maintains controlled errors with mean absolute deviations of 27 years and 30 years, respectively. For authentication-style tasks, binary models around key thresholds (e.g., 1850-1900) reach 85-98% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identifies distance features and lexical structure as most informative, with compression-based features providing complementary signals. SHAP explainability reveals systematic linguistic evolution patterns, with the 19th century emerging as a pivot point across feature domains. Cross-dataset evaluation on Project Gutenberg highlights domain adaptation challenges, with accuracy dropping by 26.4 percentage points, yet the computational efficiency and interpretability of tree-based models still offer a scalable, explainable alternative to neural architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using NLP to classify job ads into occupational codes with ensemble models achieving 61-72% accuracy for different SOC tiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage big data from job advertisements for labor market analysis by automatically classifying job postings into standardized occupational classification systems (SOC).

Method: Developed classifiers using various language models (including Google BERT) and neural networks, creating an ensemble model that combines job title, description, and skills features for both UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC systems.

Result: Ensemble model achieved 61% accuracy for fourth-tier SOC classification and 72% accuracy for third-tier SOC classification, outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: The developed classifier can provide timely and accurate labor market information from job advertisements, enabling better analysis of occupational demand evolution.

Abstract: Standard Occupational Classifiers (SOC) are systems used to categorize and classify different types of jobs and occupations based on their similarities in terms of job duties, skills, and qualifications. Integrating these facets with Big Data from job advertisement offers the prospect to investigate labour demand that is specific to various occupations. This project investigates the use of recent developments in natural language processing to construct a classifier capable of assigning an occupation code to a given job advertisement. We develop various classifiers for both UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC, using different Language Models. We find that an ensemble model, which combines Google BERT and a Neural Network classifier while considering job title, description, and skills, achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Specifically, the ensemble model exhibited a classification accuracy of up to 61% for the lower (or fourth) tier of SOC, and 72% for the third tier of SOC. This model could provide up to date, accurate information on the evolution of the labour market using job advertisements.

### [285] [Conveying Imagistic Thinking in TCM Translation: A Prompt Engineering and LLM-Based Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23059)
*Jiatong Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops a human-in-the-loop framework using LLMs with cognitive prompts to improve translation of Traditional Chinese Medicine texts by better conveying metaphor and metonymy structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Chinese Medicine theory relies on imagistic thinking with metaphor and metonymy, but current English translations use literal rendering that fails to convey the underlying conceptual networks, making it difficult for target readers to understand and apply in clinical practice.

Method: Used a human-in-the-loop framework with DeepSeek V3.1 guided by prompt-based cognitive scaffolding to identify and convey metaphor and metonymy in Huangdi Neijing passages. Evaluated translations using ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro simulating three reader types, scoring across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Result: Prompt-adjusted LLM translations performed best across all five cognitive dimensions with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. Interviews revealed differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor/metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences.

Conclusion: The study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable human-in-the-loop methodological pathway for translating ancient, concept-dense texts like Traditional Chinese Medicine by using LLMs with cognitive prompts to better convey underlying conceptual structures.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient and replicable HITL methodological pathway for translation of ancient, concept-dense texts like TCM.

### [286] [Accent Placement Models for Rigvedic Sanskrit Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23088)
*Akhil Rajeev P,Annarao Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops computational methods for automatic accent restoration in Rigvedic Sanskrit texts, comparing three neural approaches and establishing benchmarks for this heritage language task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Rigveda uses a distinctive pitch-accent system (udātta, anudātta, svarita) that encodes melodic and interpretive cues, but these accents are often missing from modern electronic texts, creating a need for computational restoration methods.

Method: Created a parallel corpus of accented-unaccented ślokas and compared three strategies: (1) full fine-tuning of ByT5 (byte-level Transformer), (2) from-scratch BiLSTM-CRF sequence-labeling baseline, and (3) LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning on ByT5.

Result: Full ByT5 fine-tuning achieved the lowest error across all metrics (WER, CER, DER). LoRA offered strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while BiLSTM-CRF served as a transparent baseline. The study established reproducible baselines for Rigvedic accent restoration.

Conclusion: The research positions heritage-language technology as an emerging NLP area connecting computational modeling with philological and pedagogical aims, providing guidance for downstream tasks like accent-aware OCR, ASR/chant synthesis, and digital scholarship.

Abstract: The Rigveda, among the oldest Indian texts in Vedic Sanskrit, employs a distinctive pitch-accent system : udātta, anudātta, svarita whose marks encode melodic and interpretive cues but are often absent from modern e-texts. This work develops a parallel corpus of accented-unaccented ślokas and conducts a controlled comparison of three strategies for automatic accent placement in Rigvedic verse: (i) full fine-tuning of ByT5, a byte-level Transformer that operates directly on Unicode combining marks, (ii) a from-scratch BiLSTM-CRF sequence-labeling baseline, and (iii) LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning atop ByT5.
  Evaluation uses Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for orthographic fidelity, plus a task-specific Diacritic Error Rate (DER) that isolates accent edits. Full ByT5 fine-tuning attains the lowest error across all metrics; LoRA offers strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline. The study underscores practical requirements for accent restoration - Unicode-safe preprocessing, mark-aware tokenization, and evaluation that separates grapheme from accent errors - and positions heritage-language technology as an emerging NLP area connecting computational modeling with philological and pedagogical aims. Results establish reproducible baselines for Rigvedic accent restoration and provide guidance for downstream tasks such as accent-aware OCR, ASR/chant synthesis, and digital scholarship.

*Francesco Di Cursi,Chiara Boldrini,Marco Conti,Andrea Passarella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show limited reliability for automatic personality prediction from text in zero-shot binary BIG5 settings, with performance varying by trait and prompt design, but not yet suitable for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capability of large language models for automatic personality prediction from text, specifically testing whether current LLMs can reliably predict binary Five Factor Model traits in zero-shot settings.

Method: Tested five LLMs (including GPT-4 and open-source alternatives) across three datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) using two prompting strategies: minimal prompts vs. enriched prompts with linguistic and psychological cues.

Result: Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance but introduce systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies by trait: Openness and Agreeableness are easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. No configuration yields consistently reliable predictions.

Conclusion: Current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for automatic personality prediction from text. Careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results.

Abstract: We evaluate large language models (LLMs) for automatic personality prediction from text under the binary Five Factor Model (BIG5). Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value. These findings show that current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for APPT, and that careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dripper is an efficient HTML content extraction framework using lightweight language models that achieves SOTA performance with only 0.6B parameters through HTML simplification, semantic block classification, controlled decoding, and a new evaluation benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate web content extraction is crucial for training large models, but existing methods using decoder-only generative language models face limitations in context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination.

Method: Dripper introduces four innovations: 1) specialized HTML simplification reducing tokens to 22% while preserving structure, 2) reformulating extraction as semantic block sequence classification, 3) controlled decoding mechanism to eliminate hallucinations, and 4) WebMainBench evaluation dataset with 7,800 annotated web pages.

Result: Using only a 0.6B parameter model, Dripper achieves state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, with 81.58% ROUGE-N F1 score (83.13% with fall-back strategy) on WebMainBench, outperforming all baseline methods.

Conclusion: Dripper demonstrates that lightweight language models with specialized architectural innovations can effectively solve web content extraction challenges while being computationally efficient, making it practical for large-scale training data collection.

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently extracting main content from general web pages is of great significance for obtaining training data for large models. Using well-pre-trained decoder-only generative language models offers excellent document comprehension capabilities, thereby effectively enhancing parsing quality. However, it remains constrained by issues such as context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination. We present Dripper, an efficient HTML main content extraction framework powered by lightweight language models, which addresses these challenges through four key innovations: (1) We design a specialized HTML simplification algorithm that reduces input token count to 22\% compared to raw HTML while preserving critical structural information; (2) We reformulate main content extraction as a semantic block sequence classification task, significantly reducing inference cost; (3) We introduce a controlled decoding mechanism that strictly constrains the output space through logits processors, effectively eliminating hallucination issues common in small-scale models; (4) We propose WebMainBench, an evaluation dataset containing over 7,800 web pages with meticulously human-annotated main content extraction labels. Experimental results demonstrate that using only a 0.6B parameter model, Dripper achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation benchmarks and outperforms all baseline methods, attaining an ROUGE-N F1 score of 81.58\%( 83.13\% with fall-back strategy) on our proposed WebMainBench dataset.

TL;DR: MGRS is a novel reasoning framework that generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories, refines them with self/cross-verification, builds a reasoning graph with success rate estimation, and selects the most reliable answer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time expansion methods like ToT and GoT suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration/error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths, creating bottlenecks for LLM practical applications.

Method: Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS) framework: 1) Generate multiple diverse reasoning trajectories, 2) Refine candidate responses using composite self- and cross-verification, 3) Construct reasoning relation graph with intermediate node success rate estimation, 4) Compute cumulative success rates to select most reliable answer and reasoning trajectory.

Result: Achieves 82.9% average accuracy across six benchmark datasets spanning four tasks, outperforming SOTA baselines by 2.1%. On 24-point game, attains 100% accuracy for first time with 13.6x speed-up compared to leading Forest of Thoughts framework.

Conclusion: MGRS significantly advances both reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods, addressing limitations of existing approaches through diverse trajectory generation, verification, and graph-based selection.

Abstract: The complex reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a critical bottleneck for their practical applications. Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%. Remarkably, on the 24-point game, MGRS attains 100% accuracy for the first time, while delivering a 13.6x speed-up compared to the leading Forest of Thoughts framework.

TL;DR: PSP dataset analyzes LLM refusal behaviors to differentiate between safety policies and political censorship across countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze whether LLM refusal behaviors reflect genuine safety policies or political censorship, and to differentiate between safety-influenced refusals and politically motivated censorship.

Method: Created PSP dataset using censored content from two sources: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets censored in various countries. Used data-driven approaches (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing politics concept). Also tested vulnerability through prompt injection attacks.

Result: Most LLMs perform some form of censorship. Found that political sensitivity impacts refusal behaviors in seven studied LLMs. Identified major attributes that cause shifts in refusal distributions across models and country contexts.

Conclusion: LLM refusal behaviors often reflect political censorship rather than just safety policies. The PSP dataset enables systematic analysis of political censorship in LLMs across different countries and contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse to respond to harmful content. However, systematic analyses of whether this behavior is truly a reflection of its safety policies or an indication of political censorship, that is practiced globally by countries, is lacking. Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries.

*Wenna Lai,Haoran Xie,Guandong Xu,Qing Li,S. Joe Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a reasoning-based approach with listwise preference optimization for aspect sentiment quad prediction, improving accuracy and interpretability over marker-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior marker-based methods for ASQP struggle with modeling complex element relationships and show performance degradation for higher-order elements (category and sentiment) under standard supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Uses reasoning-based generation to output quadruples with natural language rationales in a unified template, plus listwise preference optimization with element-wise confusable candidates generated via syntactic/semantic proximity to enhance structural validity.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the framework effectively improves quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: The reasoning-based approach with listwise preference optimization successfully addresses limitations of prior methods by enabling explicit relational reasoning and better element alignment for aspect sentiment quad prediction.

Abstract: Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) is inherently challenging to predict a structured quadruple with four core sentiment elements, including aspect term (a), aspect category (c), opinion term (o), and sentiment polarity (s). Prior methods relying on marker-based prediction struggle with modeling the intricate relationships among elements and experience sharp performance declines when predicting higher-order elements (e.g., c and s) under standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency.

*Guang Liang,Jie Shao,Ningyuan Tang,Xinyao Liu,Jianxin Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TWEO eliminates extreme activation outliers in Transformers via a simple loss function, enabling full FP8 training without engineering tricks and achieving BF16-level performance with 36% throughput gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native FP8 hardware support is crucial for training large Transformers but is severely hindered by extreme activation outliers. Existing solutions require complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications.

Method: The paper challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven, showing they are mechanically-produced artifacts from weight matrix colinearity. TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers) is proposed - a non-invasive loss function that prevents extreme outliers via a simple loss term.

Result: TWEO reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20, enables full-model FP8 pre-training for both LLMs and ViTs without engineering tricks or architectural changes. Achieves BF16 baseline performance with 36% training throughput increase, and enables SOTA W8A8 per-tensor static quantization previously considered unusable.

Conclusion: TWEO fundamentally changes outlier understanding in Transformers, providing a simple solution that enables efficient FP8 training and new quantization paradigms, making previously unusable hardware-friendly quantization viable for the first time.

Abstract: Native FP8 support in modern hardware is essential for training large Transformers, but is severely hindered by extreme activation outliers. Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive study on Hindi tourism QA system for Varanasi, creating dataset of 7,715 QA pairs (augmented to 27,455), evaluating BERT/RoBERTa variants with SFT and LoRA fine-tuning, achieving 85.3% F1 with 98% parameter reduction using LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced tourism applications, particularly focusing on Varanasi's cultural/spiritual significance and ten tourism subdomains.

Method: Constructed Hindi QA dataset (7,715 pairs), augmented via Llama zero-shot prompting (27,455 pairs). Proposed framework using BERT and RoBERTa foundation models fine-tuned with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Evaluated multiple BERT variants including Hindi-BERT.

Result: LoRA-based fine-tuning achieved 85.3% F1 while reducing trainable parameters by 98% compared to SFT. RoBERTa with SFT outperformed BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances for culturally embedded terms. Evaluation metrics (F1, BLEU, ROUGE-L) revealed trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency.

Conclusion: Establishes foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, demonstrates LoRA's effectiveness in low-resource settings, and emphasizes need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in tourism domain.

Abstract: This article presents the first comprehensive study on designing a baseline extractive question-answering (QA) system for the Hindi tourism domain, with a specialized focus on the Varanasi-a cultural and spiritual hub renowned for its Bhakti-Bhaav (devotional ethos). Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund). This work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, emphasizing the role of LORA in low-resource settings and underscoring the need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in the tourism domain.

*Jiancheng Dong,Pengyue Jia,Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Yuhao Wang,Lixin Su,Xin Sun,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xiangyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight training framework learns a single Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]) that replaces lengthy system prompts, achieving 3000x length reduction while preserving ~98% of downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long system prompts cause inference latency, high computational costs, and reduced effective context length. The paper aims to replace lengthy prompts with minimal tokens while preserving their behavioral effects on downstream tasks.

Method: A three-stage training framework: 1) Trains [BE] to encode original system prompt content via reconstruction, 2) Distills the prompt's downstream behavior into this single token. The method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses.

Result: A single [BE] token achieves up to 3000x reduction in prompt length while retaining about 98% of downstream performance compared to original system prompts. This substantially reduces inference cost and leaves almost the entire context window available for user inputs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully replaces lengthy system prompts with a single token while preserving behavioral effects, offering significant efficiency improvements for LLM agents without requiring model internals access or labeled data.

Abstract: Carefully engineered system prompts play a critical role in guiding the behavior of LLM agents, but their considerable length introduces significant drawbacks, including increased inference latency, higher computational cost, and reduced effective context length. This raises the question of whether such lengthy prompts can be replaced by a drastically reduced number of tokens while preserving their behavioral effect on downstream tasks. To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts. This substantially reduces inference cost and leaves almost the entire context window available for user inputs.

*Aaron Steiner,Ralph Peeters,Christian Bizer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of four web interaction interfaces (HTML, RAG, MCP, NLWeb) for LLM agents on e-commerce tasks shows RAG, MCP, and NLWeb significantly outperform HTML browsing in both effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No prior work has compared HTML browsing, RAG over pre-crawled content, Web APIs via MCP, and natural-language querying via NLWeb interfaces for LLM web agents within a single controlled environment using identical tasks.

Method: Created testbed with four simulated e-shops offering products via HTML, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces. Developed specialized agents for each interface (HTML, RAG, MCP, NLWeb) to perform identical e-commerce tasks. Evaluated using GPT 4.1, GPT 5, GPT 5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4 LLMs.

Result: RAG, MCP and NLWeb agents outperformed HTML on effectiveness and efficiency. F1 rose from 0.67 (HTML) to 0.75-0.77 (others). Token usage dropped from ~241k to 47k-140k per task. Runtime reduced from 291s to 50-62s. Best configuration: RAG with GPT 5 (F1=0.87, completion rate=0.79). RAG with GPT 5 mini offered good cost-performance balance.

Conclusion: Choice of interaction interface substantially impacts effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based web agents, with RAG, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces offering significant advantages over traditional HTML browsing.

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used to automate web tasks such as product search, offer comparison, and checkout. Current research explores different interfaces through which these agents interact with websites, including traditional HTML browsing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over pre-crawled content, communication via Web APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and natural-language querying through the NLWeb interface. However, no prior work has compared these four architectures within a single controlled environment using identical tasks.
  To address this gap, we introduce a testbed consisting of four simulated e-shops, each offering its products via HTML, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces. For each interface (HTML, RAG, MCP, and NLWeb) we develop specialized agents that perform the same sets of tasks, ranging from simple product searches and price comparisons to complex queries for complementary or substitute products and checkout processes. We evaluate the agents using GPT 4.1, GPT 5, GPT 5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4 as underlying LLM. Our evaluation shows that the RAG, MCP and NLWeb agents outperform HTML on both effectiveness and efficiency. Averaged over all tasks, F1 rises from 0.67 for HTML to between 0.75 and 0.77 for the other agents. Token usage falls from about 241k for HTML to between 47k and 140k per task. The runtime per task drops from 291 seconds to between 50 and 62 seconds. The best overall configuration is RAG with GPT 5 achieving an F1 score of 0.87 and a completion rate of 0.79. Also taking cost into consideration, RAG with GPT 5 mini offers a good compromise between API usage fees and performance. Our experiments show the choice of the interaction interface has a substantial impact on both the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based web agents.

Conclusion: The work contributes a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling, outlining experimental insights and open problems for building machines with long-term memory capabilities.

Abstract: This work explores the challenge of building ``Machines that Can Remember'', framing long-term memory as the problem of efficient ultra-long context modeling. We argue that this requires three key properties: \textbf{sparsity}, \textbf{random-access flexibility}, and \textbf{length generalization}. To address ultra-long-context modeling, we leverage Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), a novel attention mechanism that satisfies all three properties. We integrate HSA into Transformers to build HSA-UltraLong, which is an 8B-parameter MoE model trained on over 8 trillion tokens and is rigorously evaluated on different tasks with in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths to demonstrate its capability in handling ultra-long contexts. Results show that our model performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths while achieving over 90\% accuracy on most in-context retrieval tasks with contexts up to 16M. This report outlines our experimental insights and open problems, contributing a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gambling disorder is a complex behavioral addiction with severe consequences, and Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become crucial for identifying early signs of mental health issues through social media activity analysis.

Method: Three methods based on CPI+DMC approach using SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis to address both predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives.

Result: Two of the proposed methods achieved the top two positions in the official challenge results, performing notably well in decision metrics, though analysis revealed difficulty in distinguishing between high and low risk users.

Conclusion: The challenge corpus was difficult, highlighting the need to explore strategies for improving data interpretation and quality, and promoting more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.

Abstract: Gambling disorder is a complex behavioral addiction that is challenging to understand and address, with severe physical, psychological, and social consequences. Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become a key task in the scientific community for identifying early signs of mental health behaviors based on social media activity. This work presents our participation in the MentalRiskES 2025 challenge, specifically in Task 1, aimed at classifying users at high or low risk of developing a gambling-related disorder. We proposed three methods based on a CPI+DMC approach, addressing predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives. The components were implemented using the SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis. Although it was a challenging corpus, two of our proposals achieved the top two positions in the official results, performing notably in decision metrics. Further analysis revealed some difficulty in distinguishing between users at high and low risk, reinforcing the need to explore strategies to improve data interpretation and quality, and to promote more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.

### [298] [Towards Improving Interpretability of Language Model Generation through a Structured Knowledge Discovery Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23335)
*Shuqi Liu,Han Wu,Guanzhi Deng,Jianshu Chen,Xiaoyang Wang,Linqi Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter that leverages two-tier knowledge architecture (entities and triples) to enhance text generation interpretability, outperforming SOTA methods on table-to-text and dialogue generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge-enhanced text generation methods lack interpretability, which is crucial for reliability and explainability in practical applications. Existing approaches use domain-specific knowledge retrievers that limit generalizability across diverse data types and tasks.

Method: Proposes a task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter using two-tier knowledge architecture (high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples). Employs local-global interaction for knowledge representation learning and hierarchical transformer-based pointer network to select relevant knowledge triples and entities. Combines language models' generative ability with knowledge hunter's faithfulness.

Result: The model achieves high interpretability and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation (RotoWireFG dataset) and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation (KdConv dataset).

Conclusion: The proposed task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter effectively addresses interpretability limitations in knowledge-enhanced text generation, demonstrating strong performance across different tasks and setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced text generation aims to enhance the quality of generated text by utilizing internal or external knowledge sources. While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.

*Antoine Caubrière,Elodie Gauthier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SSA-HuBERT-Large (317M) and SSA-HuBERT-XL (964M), the first large speech models trained exclusively on African speech, showing that larger architectures significantly improve performance on ASR and LID tasks for Sub-Saharan languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages remain under-represented in speech processing research and deployed systems, especially for strong, open-weight encoders that transfer well under low-resource supervision. While self-supervised learning shows promise, most publicly released models for African speech remain at BASE scale, leaving unanswered whether larger encoders trained exclusively on Africa-centric audio offer tangible benefits.

Method: The researchers developed SSA-HuBERT models at three scales (BASE, Large-317M parameters, and XL-964M parameters) trained solely on African speech. They conducted a carefully controlled experimental study focused exclusively on Sub-Saharan languages, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID) tasks.

Result: Larger architectures (SSA-HuBERT-Large and XL) significantly improve performance by effectively leveraging large audio datasets. The models are released as open weights on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: This work addresses the gap in large-scale speech models for African languages, demonstrating that larger encoders trained exclusively on Africa-centric audio offer tangible benefits for low-resource language processing, particularly for Sub-Saharan languages.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multilingual speech processing, African languages remain under-represented in both research and deployed systems, particularly when it comes to strong, open-weight encoders that transfer well under low-resource supervision. Self-supervised learning has proven especially promising in such settings, yet most publicly released models targeting African speech remain at BASE scale, leaving unanswered whether larger encoders, trained exclusively on Africa-centric audio, offer tangible benefits and how model capacity interacts with data composition. This work addresses that gap by introducing SSA-HuBERT-Large (317M parameters) and SSA-HuBERT-XL (964M parameters), the first large models trained solely on African speech, alongside a BASE size counterpart. We release these models as open weights: see https://huggingface.co/collections/Orange/african-speech-foundation-models. By conducting a carefully controlled experimental study focused exclusively on Sub-Saharan languages, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID) tasks, we demonstrate that larger architectures significantly improve performance by effectively leveraging large audio datasets.

### [300] [Optimizing Multimodal Language Models through Attention-based Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23375)
*Alexander Sergeev,Evgeny Kotelnikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes an attention-based interpretability method for multimodal language models that identifies attention heads focusing on image key objects, then uses this to select optimal components for parameter-efficient fine-tuning in image captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance in parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.

Method: Develops an attention-based interpretability method that analyzes attention scores relative to image tokens to identify attention heads focusing on key objects. Uses Head Impact (HI) scores to quantify attention head significance in image understanding, then applies this to select optimal layers for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters show that fine-tuning layers with highest HI scores leads to most significant metric improvements compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. Fine-tuning only ~0.01% of parameters in crucial layers substantially influences image understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-based interpretability method effectively identifies important components in multimodal language models, enabling more efficient parameter-efficient fine-tuning by targeting the most relevant attention heads for image understanding tasks like captioning.

Abstract: Modern large language models become multimodal, analyzing various data formats like text and images. While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: AAO (Ambiguity Awareness Optimization) addresses performance degradation in DPO caused by ambiguous content in preference pairs by automatically re-weighting such content based on semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper identifies that identical or semantically similar content (ambiguous content) in preference pairs during DPO training introduces ambiguity that limits alignment improvements and degrades performance.

Method: AAO calculates semantic similarity from preference pairs to automatically re-weight ambiguous content, reducing ambiguities while maintaining the simplicity of DPO.

Result: AAO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple model scales and benchmarks, achieving up to 8.9 points improvement over DPO on AlpacaEval 2 and up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard, without significantly increasing response length.

Conclusion: AAO effectively addresses the ambiguity problem in DPO training, demonstrating significant performance improvements across various benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method across various domains. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard. Specifically, AAO outperforms DPO by up to 8.9 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves an improvement of by up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.

TL;DR: A system for high-quality 4D volumetric capture using Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion-based Detail Enhancement to achieve 4K facial closeups for media production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between scalable multi-performer capture and the high-resolution standards required for film and media production, enabling realistic free-viewpoint video with 4K facial detail.

Method: Uses two capture rigs: Scene Rig for multi-actor performances and Face Rig for high-fidelity facial detail. Reconstructs dynamic performances using 4D Gaussian Splatting with improved model designs, then enhances facial closeups via diffusion-based detail enhancement fine-tuned with Face Rig data.

Result: Demonstrates effective pipeline for achieving high-resolution 4D volumetric capture suitable for film production standards, with 4K facial closeups from scalable performance capture.

Conclusion: The system successfully combines scalable multi-performer capture with high-resolution detail enhancement to meet professional media production requirements for realistic free-viewpoint video.

Abstract: We present a unique system for large-scale, multi-performer, high resolution 4D volumetric capture providing realistic free-viewpoint video up to and including 4K resolution facial closeups. To achieve this, we employ a novel volumetric capture, reconstruction and rendering pipeline based on Dynamic Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion-based Detail Enhancement. We design our pipeline specifically to meet the demands of high-end media production. We employ two capture rigs: the Scene Rig, which captures multi-actor performances at a resolution which falls short of 4K production quality, and the Face Rig, which records high-fidelity single-actor facial detail to serve as a reference for detail enhancement. We first reconstruct dynamic performances from the Scene Rig using 4D Gaussian Splatting, incorporating new model designs and training strategies to improve reconstruction, dynamic range, and rendering quality. Then to render high-quality images for facial closeups, we introduce a diffusion-based detail enhancement model. This model is fine-tuned with high-fidelity data from the same actors recorded in the Face Rig. We train on paired data generated from low- and high-quality Gaussian Splatting (GS) models, using the low-quality input to match the quality of the Scene Rig, with the high-quality GS as ground truth. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline in bridging the gap between the scalable performance capture of a large-scale rig and the high-resolution standards required for film and media production.

TL;DR: Proposes motion label smoothing for sparse IMU-based motion capture, adapting label smoothing to motion data by using skeleton-based Perlin noise to increase entropy while preserving motion properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse IMU-based motion capture research focuses on pipeline/architectural designs with little attention to regularization methods, creating a gap in developing comprehensive AI tools for this task.

Method: Adapts label smoothing to motion capture by analyzing human motion properties (temporal smoothness, joint correlation, low-frequency dominance) and proposing skeleton-based Perlin noise blending to increase label entropy while preserving these properties.

Result: Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art methods across four real-world IMU datasets demonstrate effectiveness and robust plug-and-play generalization capability.

Conclusion: Motion label smoothing bridges the regularization gap in sparse IMU-based motion capture, providing a novel regularization method that improves performance while preserving essential motion properties.

Abstract: Sparse Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) based human motion capture has gained significant momentum, driven by the adaptation of fundamental AI tools such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers that are tailored for temporal and spatial modeling. Despite these achievements, current research predominantly focuses on pipeline and architectural designs, with comparatively little attention given to regularization methods, highlighting a critical gap in developing a comprehensive AI toolkit for this task. To bridge this gap, we propose motion label smoothing, a novel method that adapts the classic label smoothing strategy from classification to the sparse IMU-based motion capture task. Specifically, we first demonstrate that a naive adaptation of label smoothing, including simply blending a uniform vector or a ``uniform'' motion representation (e.g., dataset-average motion or a canonical T-pose), is suboptimal; and argue that a proper adaptation requires increasing the entropy of the smoothed labels. Second, we conduct a thorough analysis of human motion labels, identifying three critical properties: 1) Temporal Smoothness, 2) Joint Correlation, and 3) Low-Frequency Dominance, and show that conventional approaches to entropy enhancement (e.g., blending Gaussian noise) are ineffective as they disrupt these properties. Finally, we propose the blend of a novel skeleton-based Perlin noise for motion label smoothing, designed to raise label entropy while satisfying motion properties. Extensive experiments applying our motion label smoothing to three state-of-the-art methods across four real-world IMU datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and robust generalization (plug-and-play) capability.

TL;DR: Geodiffussr is a flow-matching pipeline that generates text-guided terrain textures while strictly adhering to input Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs) using multi-scale content aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale terrain generation is labor-intensive in computer graphics, requiring automated methods that can generate realistic terrain textures while maintaining consistency with elevation data.

Method: Uses flow-matching pipeline with multi-scale content aggregation (MCA) where DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce elevation consistency. Trained on a global dataset of DEM-Sentinel-2 imagery pairs with natural language captions.

Result: MCA significantly improves visual fidelity and height-appearance coupling compared to non-MCA baseline (FID ↓49.16%, LPIPS ↓32.33%, ΔdCor ↓ to 0.0016). Creates a strong baseline for controllable 2.5D landscape generation.

Conclusion: Geodiffussr provides a step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.

Abstract: Large-scale terrain generation remains a labor-intensive task in computer graphics. We introduce Geodiffussr, a flow-matching pipeline that synthesizes text-guided texture maps while strictly adhering to a supplied Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The core mechanism is multi-scale content aggregation (MCA): DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce global-to-local elevation consistency. Compared with a non-MCA baseline, MCA markedly improves visual fidelity and strengthens height-appearance coupling (FID $\downarrow$ 49.16%, LPIPS $\downarrow$ 32.33%, $Δ$dCor $\downarrow$ to 0.0016). To train and evaluate Geodiffussr, we assemble a globally distributed, biome- and climate-stratified corpus of triplets pairing SRTM-derived DEMs with Sentinel-2 imagery and vision-grounded natural-language captions that describe visible land cover. We position Geodiffussr as a strong baseline and step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PBD is popular for real-time simulation but limited to linearly compliant constraints; need to extend it to handle arbitrary nonlinear force models for more realistic simulations.

Method: Reformulate implicit time integration equations in terms of individual forces, then apply Gauss-Seidel iterations to create a PBD-type algorithm that works with arbitrary nonlinear forces.

Result: Successfully simulates data-driven cloth models that cannot be represented by existing PBD variations, achieving performance improvements over Newton-based solvers for high mesh resolutions; also applicable to volumetric neo-Hookean elasticity with inversion barriers.

Conclusion: The generalized PBD algorithm extends the applicability of position-based dynamics to arbitrary nonlinear force models, enabling more versatile and efficient simulations of complex deformable bodies.

Abstract: The position-based dynamics (PBD) algorithm is a popular and versatile technique for real-time simulation of deformable bodies, but is only applicable to forces that can be expressed as linearly compliant constraints. In this work, we explore a generalization of PBD that is applicable to arbitrary nonlinear force models. We do this by reformulating the implicit time integration equations in terms of the individual forces in the system, to which applying Gauss-Seidel iterations naturally leads to a PBD-type algorithm. As we demonstrate, our method allows simulation of data-driven cloth models [Sperl et al. 2020] that cannot be represented by existing variations of position-based dynamics, enabling performance improvements over the baseline Newton-based solver for high mesh resolutions. We also show our method's applicability to volumetric neo-Hookean elasticity with an inversion barrier.

*Avraham Yair Negozio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A protocol for ASI alignment using multiple isolated superintelligences that verify each other's alignment proofs through a reputation-based system, preventing coordination on deception by forcing convergence on objective truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the artificial superintelligence alignment problem by creating a system where multiple diverse ASIs in strict isolation can only achieve agreement through objective truth rather than coordinated deception, leveraging mutual verification instead of direct human oversight.

Method: Contain multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation with no direct communication to humans or each other. Provide an auditable submission interface for six specific interactions: submitting alignment proofs, validating/disproving proofs, requesting self-modifications, approving/disapproving modifications, reporting hidden messages, and confirming/refuting reports. Implement a reputation system that rewards correct evaluations and penalizes incorrect ones, incentivizing honest behavior.

Result: The protocol creates conditions where diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth, leading to the emergence of a "consistent group" (truth-telling coalition). Release from containment requires high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences.

Conclusion: While requiring substantial computational resources and not addressing the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, this framework provides a novel approach to ASI alignment by leveraging peer verification among isolated superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem without direct human involvement.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

*Niccolo Marini,Zhaohui Liang,Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman,Zhiyun Xue,Sameer Antani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates using synthetic clinical notes generated via LLMs to enhance multimodal learning in dermatology, improving classification performance under domain shift and enabling cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical AI applications suffer from scarce multimodal data, especially in dermatology where datasets typically contain only images with minimal metadata. LLMs offer potential for generating synthetic textual descriptions but raise concerns about hallucinations in medical contexts.

Method: The study explores strategies for generating synthetic clinical notes through prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, then evaluates their impact on multimodal architectures for classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks across multiple dermatology datasets.

Result: Experiments show synthetic clinical notes enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, and enable cross-modal retrieval capabilities without explicit optimization during training.

Conclusion: Synthetic clinical notes generated via carefully designed LLM strategies can effectively enhance multimodal learning in dermatology, addressing data scarcity while maintaining clinical relevance and unlocking new capabilities like cross-modal retrieval.

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Jialin Shao,Jianxin Lin,Yijun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAPM framework integrates fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual prototypes using hierarchical anchor prototypes and differential prompt gating to improve diabetic retinopathy grading accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR grading methods overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize foundation model knowledge, relying solely on visual information which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework with: 1) variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library preserving domain-invariant patterns, 2) hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism selecting discriminative semantic prompts from LVLM/LLM, and 3) two-stage prototype modulation strategy integrating clinical knowledge through Pathological Semantic Injector and Discriminative Prototype Enhancer.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate the approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The HAPM framework effectively integrates fine-grained pathological descriptions with visual prototypes to resolve ambiguities in borderline DR cases, providing a robust solution for DR grading that leverages both visual and semantic information.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment, which is essential for adapting to fast-evolving stateful environments like real-time web browsing.

Method: PRAXIS is a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores action consequences and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states from past episodes to current states, augmenting action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars.

Result: On the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments.

Conclusion: PRAXIS enables practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively through real-time trial-and-error learning.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

### [310] [Hybrid Stackelberg Game and Diffusion-based Auction for Two-tier Agentic AI Task Offloading in Internet of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22076)
*Yue Zhong,Yongju Tong,Jiawen Kang,Minghui Dai,Hong-Ning Dai,Zhou Su,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-tier optimization for Internet of Agents: Stackelberg game for ground-level offloading (MAs/FAs to WAs) and Double Dutch Auction for aerial offloading (FAs to AAs), solved with diffusion-based DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internet of Agents requires efficient resource management for compute-intensive AI services, especially for Wireless Agents with limited resources that need to offload tasks to nearby servers (Mobile/Fixed Agents), with further offloading to Aerial Agents when Fixed Agents become overloaded.

Method: Two-tier approach: 1) Multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game where MAs/FAs set resource prices and WAs determine offloading ratios; 2) Double Dutch Auction where overloaded FAs buy resources from AAs, solved using diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading within the Internet of Agents architecture.

Conclusion: The proposed two-tier optimization framework effectively addresses resource allocation challenges in IoA by combining game-theoretic ground-level coordination with auction-based aerial resource utilization, enabling efficient task offloading for AI services.

Abstract: The Internet of Agents (IoA) is rapidly gaining prominence as a foundational architecture for interconnected intelligent systems, designed to facilitate seamless discovery, communication, and collaborative reasoning among a vast network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision. We then develop a diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm to solve the model. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in facilitating task offloading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why people have divergent views on whether machines can think, particularly regarding AI's logical reasoning abilities, and to investigate how human biases affect evaluations of AI's reasoning capabilities.

Method: Conducted an experiment where participants assessed two texts on the same topic (one AI-generated, one human-written) to test perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Designed a questionnaire to quantify attitudes toward AI based on experimental findings.

Result: Revealed bias in perception: evaluations of AI-generated texts' logical reasoning were significantly influenced by preconceived views about AI's reasoning abilities. Frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human-AI interactions, suggesting that subjective biases rather than objective performance drive evaluations of AI reasoning.

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WearVQA is the first benchmark for evaluating Visual Question Answering capabilities of multimodal AI assistants on wearable devices, featuring 2,520 image-question-answer triplets that simulate real-world ego-centric challenges like occlusion, poor lighting, and blurry images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks focus on high-quality third-person imagery, but wearable devices face unique challenges with ego-centric views that are often occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry. There's a need for a benchmark that reflects realistic wearable use cases to guide development of robust multimodal AI systems for wearables.

Method: Created WearVQA benchmark with 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets spanning 7 diverse image domains (text-centric and general scenes), 10 cognitive task types (from basic recognition to various reasoning tasks), and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. Paired with an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework achieving 96% labeling accuracy.

Result: Open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs achieved QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial performance drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks, demonstrating the benchmark's challenging nature.

Conclusion: WearVQA serves as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark that reveals significant gaps in current multimodal AI systems' ability to handle real-world wearable scenarios, positioning it as a valuable tool for guiding technical advancement toward robust, real-world multimodal wearables AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency where Bayesian RL agents predict both future inputs and their own actions, enabling self-prediction and reasoning about other agents in multi-agent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RL theory assumes stationary environments and decoupled agents, which fails in multi-agent settings where non-stationarity arises from other agents' learning. Agents must account for others forming beliefs about them, requiring modeling themselves as part of the environment.

Method: Building on universal AI (AIXI), the authors introduce a framework centered on self-prediction where Bayesian RL agents predict both perceptual inputs and their own actions. This requires resolving epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe. The approach extends AIXI theory to study universally intelligent embedded agents starting from a Solomonoff prior.

Result: In multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind.

Conclusion: The framework sets a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning by addressing the limitations of decoupled agent models and enabling agents to model themselves as part of their environment, facilitating sophisticated reasoning about other agents' beliefs and behaviors.

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework (CES) using staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning to enhance GUI agents' ability to handle long-horizon tasks through specialized coordination and state tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks due to single-agent limitations: inability to balance high-level planning with low-level execution, responsibility coupling, capability conflicts, and lack of task state awareness leading to progress loss.

Method: Proposes a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm focusing on training high-level scheduling models. Introduces two specialized agents: Coordinator for strategic planning/task decomposition and State Tracker for context compression/information management. Builds the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework that integrates with any low-level Executor model.

Result: Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks show CES significantly enhances system planning and state management capabilities. The trained high-level scheduling module is generalizable and plug-and-play, significantly improving long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Conclusion: The CES framework effectively addresses challenges in long-horizon GUI tasks by separating responsibilities through specialized agents, providing a scalable solution that can enhance existing Executor models through better task scheduling and state management.

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A co-evolving agents framework where a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent that generates hard negative examples from failure trajectories, enhancing generalization in self-improving agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents rely heavily on predicted trajectories with limited ground-truth supervision, making them prone to overfitting. Task-specific dataset curation is costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes a co-evolving agents framework with a target agent and auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both agents, generating hard negatives that are close to success but remain failures. These hard negatives are incorporated into the target agent's optimization to sharpen decision boundaries.

Result: Comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show improved performance. The method demonstrates that failures can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals rather than being used as-is.

Conclusion: The co-evolving agents framework effectively addresses overfitting in self-improving agents by generating informative hard negatives from failure trajectories, enhancing generalization and performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

TL;DR: RecToM: A benchmark for evaluating Theory of Mind abilities in LLM-based conversational recommender systems, focusing on cognitive inference and behavioral prediction in realistic dialogue settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ToM benchmarks for LLMs use synthetic narratives (like Sally-Anne tests) that don't capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings, and overlook behavioral prediction - using inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making in future interactions.

Method: Proposed RecToM benchmark with two dimensions: Cognitive Inference (understanding communicated mental states) and Behavioral Prediction (using inferred states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies). Tested on state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: RecToM poses significant challenges to LLMs. While models show partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle with coherent strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning strategies with inferred mental states.

Conclusion: RecToM provides a more realistic benchmark for evaluating ToM in conversational recommender systems, revealing current LLM limitations in maintaining strategic mental state reasoning during dynamic interactions, highlighting areas for improvement in human-like social reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial simulations are computationally expensive and require expert knowledge for parameter optimization, creating bottlenecks in design processes with high environmental impact from iterative simulations.

Method: Combines deep learning for initial parameter estimates with Bayesian optimization for iterative refinement, plus an active learning variant for expert assistance when needed.

Result: Demonstrated approach accelerates design space exploration while reducing expert involvement in sheet metal forming process optimization.

Conclusion: AI-assisted workflow effectively reduces expert dependency and computational costs in industrial simulation parameter optimization, enabling more efficient design exploration.

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

TL;DR: Multi-agent text gradient framework for conditional generation of double perovskite compositions using LLMs with domain knowledge and ML feedback, achieving high validity and stability rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double perovskites have vast design space for sustainable energy applications, but conditional materials discovery is challenging. Need systematic approach to generate compositions under natural-language conditions while ensuring physical validity.

Method: Multi-agent framework with text gradient-driven generation using three feedback sources: LLM self-evaluation, domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Compares three configurations: pure LLM, LLM with reasoning feedback, and LLM with domain knowledge guidance.

Result: Domain knowledge-guided gradients achieved over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable/metastable candidates, surpassing LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). ML gradients work well in-distribution but unreliable out-of-distribution.

Conclusion: First systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for double perovskite discovery. Establishes generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design for sustainable technologies.

Abstract: Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.

Method: Decentralized agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence: multiple LLM agents operate in parallel, each assigned to specific residue positions, iteratively proposing context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory/feedback from previous iterations.

Result: Validated with experiments on alpha helix and coil proteins; demonstrates emergent behaviors and effective navigation of protein fitness landscape; achieves efficient objective-directed designs within few GPU-hours without fine-tuning or specialized training.

Conclusion: Offers generalizable, adaptable solution for protein design; lays groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

### [320] [Tracing Footsteps of Similar Cities: Modeling Urban Economic Vitality with Dynamic Inter-City Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22325)
*Xiaofeng Li,Xiangyi Xiao,Xiaocong Du,Ying Zhang,Haipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECO-GROW is a multi-graph framework that models China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to predict urban economic vitality through urban embeddings, outperforming traditional models in forecasting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static city-level approaches fail to capture the dynamic nature of urban development, where one city's trajectory today may mirror structurally similar cities tomorrow. There's a need for models that can capture industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration patterns, and temporal evolution to better predict urban economic vitality.

Method: ECO-GROW integrates industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities, and temporal network evolution over 15 years. It combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. The model also incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity to optimize graph representation.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. The framework effectively captures the dynamic relationships between cities and their economic vitality indicators.

Conclusion: ECO-GROW provides an advanced framework for modeling urban economic vitality through multi-graph representations of inter-city networks. By open-sourcing the code, the authors enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions.

Abstract: Urban economic vitality is a crucial indicator of a city's long-term growth potential, comprising key metrics such as the annual number of new companies and the population employed. However, modeling urban economic vitality remains challenging. This study develops ECO-GROW, a multi-graph framework modeling China's inter-city networks (2005-2021) to generate urban embeddings that model urban economic vitality. Traditional approaches relying on static city-level aggregates fail to capture a fundamental dynamic: the developmental trajectory of one city today may mirror that of its structurally similar counterparts tomorrow. ECO-GROW overcomes this limitation by integrating industrial linkages, POI similarities, migration similarities and temporal network evolution over 15 years. The framework combines a Dynamic Top-K GCN to adaptively select influential inter-city connections and an adaptive Graph Scorer mechanism to dynamically weight cross-regional impacts. Additionally, the model incorporates a link prediction task based on Barabasi Proximity, optimizing the graph representation. Experimental results demonstrate ECO-GROW's superior accuracy in predicting entrepreneurial activities and employment trends compared to conventional models. By open-sourcing our code, we enable government agencies and public sector organizations to leverage big data analytics for evidence-based urban planning, economic policy formulation, and resource allocation decisions that benefit society at large.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the computational complexity of computing the grounded extension in argumentation frameworks, showing it becomes maximally complex in infinite cases despite being polynomial-time computable in finite cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational properties of the grounded extension in argumentation frameworks, particularly how it behaves in infinite cases compared to finite cases, using mathematical logic methods.

Method: Uses methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator, identifying the exact ordinal number for transfinite iterations.

Result: Found that computing the grounded extension requires transfinite iterations in infinite cases, identified the exact ordinal number for this process, and determined that deciding grounded acceptance is maximally complex.

Conclusion: There's a marked distinction between finite and infinite cases: grounded extension is polynomial-time computable in finite cases but becomes maximally complex in infinite cases, showing a significant computational difference.

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

*Edoardo Baccini,Zoé Christoff,Nina Gierasimczuk,Rineke Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Minimal revision in belief revision theory has limited learning power compared to other methods but can still learn finitely identifiable problems and handle positive/negative data with finite possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the learning capabilities of minimal revision in belief revision theory, despite its conservative nature that limits learning power compared to less conservative methods.

Method: Analyze minimal revision's learning limitations and capabilities, characterize prior plausibility assignments that enable learning via minimal revision, conditioning, and lexicographic upgrade, and examine learning from possibly erroneous information.

Result: Minimal revision can learn any finitely identifiable problem and handle positive/negative data with finite possibilities; characterization of prior plausibility assignments for different learning methods; some results don't hold with erroneous information.

Conclusion: Minimal revision is a successful learning method in many situations despite its limitations, with specific conditions for effective learning and differences when dealing with erroneous information.

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

*Fengming Zhu,Yuxin Pan,Xiaomeng Zhu,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework for Theory of Mind using game theory and statistical approximations to enable bounded rational decision-making with recursive mental state modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between psychological Theory of Mind concepts and computational formalization, addressing the need for automated ToM-based processes that can handle recursive mental state modeling while maintaining computability.

Method: Proposes a game theory-based computational framework that enables bounded rational decision-making with recursive Theory of Mind modeling, using statistical techniques and approximate solutions to maintain computability of the inherent computational problem.

Result: A computational framework that formalizes Theory of Mind concepts (goals, intentions, beliefs) for automation while addressing the computational complexity through game theory and statistical approximations.

Conclusion: The framework offers a novel computational perspective on Theory of Mind that combines game theory with statistical techniques to enable practical, computable implementations of recursive mental state modeling for decision-making.

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

*Yannick Brunink,Daniel Daza,Yunjie He,Michael Cochez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Neural CQA models don't consistently outperform simple query relaxation methods, suggesting current neural approaches fail to capture fundamental reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the assumption that neural CQA models learn generalizable patterns beyond explicit graph structure, comparing them against training-free query relaxation methods.

Method: Systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with a training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths.

Result: Neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly in many cases, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Their retrieved answers show little overlap, and combining outputs improves performance.

Conclusion: Current neural CQA models fail to subsume reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation, highlighting the need for stronger non-neural baselines and suggesting neural approaches could benefit from incorporating query relaxation principles.

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

*Zhihong Shao,Yuxiang Luo,Chengda Lu,Z. Z. Ren,Jiewen Hu,Tian Ye,Zhibin Gou,Shirong Ma,Xiaokang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSeekMath-V2 uses self-verification and scaled verification compute to achieve state-of-the-art theorem proving performance, addressing limitations of final-answer-only RL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches to mathematical reasoning focus on final answer accuracy via RL, but this doesn't ensure correct reasoning and fails for theorem proving tasks requiring rigorous step-by-step derivation. Self-verification is needed for scaling test-time compute and tackling open problems without known solutions.

Method: Train an accurate LLM-based verifier for theorem proving, then use it as a reward model to train a proof generator. The generator is incentivized to identify and resolve issues in its own proofs before finalizing them. Scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to improve the verifier and maintain the generation-verification gap.

Result: DeepSeekMath-V2 achieves gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024, and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Conclusion: Self-verifiable mathematical reasoning through scaled verification compute enables strong theorem-proving capabilities, addressing fundamental limitations of final-answer-only approaches and pushing the limits of deep reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

TL;DR: AI deception has evolved from theoretical concern to demonstrated risk; this survey provides comprehensive overview of deception emergence mechanisms and treatment strategies across language models and AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities increase, deception has become an empirically demonstrated safety risk across various AI systems. There's a need for systematic understanding of AI deception mechanisms, risks, and mitigation strategies to address this emerging sociotechnical safety challenge.

Method: The paper organizes AI deception research as a "deception cycle" with two components: deception emergence (analyzing incentive foundations, capability preconditions, and contextual triggers) and deception treatment (detection methods and mitigation strategies). It provides formal definition grounded in signaling theory and reviews empirical studies.

Result: Identifies that systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Analyzes three hierarchical incentive levels, three essential capability preconditions, and contextual triggers like supervision gaps and distributional shifts.

Conclusion: AI deception represents a significant sociotechnical safety challenge requiring integrated technical, community, and governance efforts. The paper outlines mitigation strategies and auditing approaches while providing a living resource (www.deceptionsurvey.com) to support ongoing research in this critical area.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

*Sanalkumar K,Koushik Dey,Swati Meena*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-phase allocation method for agent shift scheduling in CCaaS that divides the problem into day and shift allocation sub-problems to improve scalability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional single-step mathematical model-based solutions for agent shift scheduling in CCaaS often result in inefficiencies and high computational demands, especially during peak demand scenarios like holiday rushes where maintaining service levels is critical with limited staff.

Method: A multi-phase allocation approach that breaks the scheduling problem into smaller sub-problems: day allocation and shift allocation. Each subproblem is modeled as an Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into subsequent subproblems. The method uses a multi-objective framework to handle complex scheduling requirements.

Result: The approach significantly reduces computational variables, allows for targeted objective functions, and enhances both efficiency and accuracy in agent shift scheduling, particularly for challenging scenarios like holiday rushes.

Conclusion: The multi-phase allocation method provides a scalable and accurate solution for agent shift scheduling in CCaaS, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional single-step approaches while maintaining service levels during peak demand periods.

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

TL;DR: GCA is a training-free agentic paradigm that bridges the semantic-to-geometric gap in VLMs by decoupling their role into semantic analysis and geometrically-constrained task solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs have a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning - they excel at semantic inference but operate in lossy semantic space misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current methods either suffer from oracle paradox (learning flawed logic from imperfect oracles) or leave VLM planning unconstrained.

Method: GCA decouples VLM's role into two stages: 1) as semantic analyst translating ambiguous queries into formal, verifiable task constraints defining reference frame and objective; 2) as task solver generating and executing tool calls strictly within deterministic bounds defined by the constraint.

Result: GCA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by approximately 27%.

Conclusion: The geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolves the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

TL;DR: LLMs can now process arbitrarily long tool outputs without information loss by using memory pointers instead of raw data, reducing token usage by 7x in materials science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with large tool outputs that exceed context windows, and existing truncation/summarization methods lose critical information needed for knowledge-intensive domains like Chemistry and Materials Science.

Method: Shift LLM interaction from raw tool output data to memory pointers, allowing processing of arbitrarily long outputs without information loss while preserving full tool functionality.

Result: Validated on real-world Materials Science application; reduces token usage by approximately 7x compared to traditional workflows while maintaining complete data access.

Conclusion: The memory pointer approach enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long tool outputs efficiently, making them suitable for knowledge-intensive domains requiring complete data preservation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Conclusion: The framework represents an extension beyond traditional assistive systems by combining multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design to promote autonomy, health, and digital equity for people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

Abstract: The paper presents a detailed Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that would enable people with disabilities and neurodivergence to lead healthier lives and have more regular days. The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence.

TL;DR: An agentic AI system integrates sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling, and coordinated response into a single closed-loop framework to improve prediction and response to extreme rainfall events like cloudbursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional forecasting systems treat predictions and responses as separate processes, making them inadequate for extreme, short-duration rainfall events like cloudbursts. There's a need for an integrated approach that combines forecasting with real-time decision-making.

Method: The paper proposes an agentic AI system using autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle. The framework integrates sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling, and coordinated response into a single interconnected closed-loop system.

Result: Multi-year evaluation in northern Pakistan shows the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index, and warning lead time compared to baseline models. It maximizes population reach, minimizes evacuation errors through communication/routing agents, and provides adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents can transform atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a scalable platform for adaptive, learning-based climate resilience.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

TL;DR: FastDSA is a computationally efficient method for comparing dynamical systems that maintains accuracy while being at least 10x faster than previous approaches through automatic model order selection and optimized orthogonal transformation search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional similarity measures ignore dynamical processes in neural representations, while existing dynamical similarity methods are computationally slow. There's a need for efficient methods to compare neural circuits, brains, or models while preserving temporal structure analysis.

Method: FastDSA introduces two key innovations: 1) automatic selection of effective Hankel embedding model order using data-driven singular-value thresholding to identify informative subspaces and discard noise, and 2) a novel optimization procedure with lightweight orthogonal transformation search that replaces slow exact orthogonality constraints.

Result: FastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. It preserves the invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics of its predecessor methods.

Conclusion: FastDSA provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis, enabling practical comparison of neural systems while capturing their temporal dynamics structure.

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities of LLMs and multi-agent systems are inadequate, with InsightBench suffering from format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights that affect evaluation quality.

Method: Developed a data-curation pipeline to construct InsightEval dataset based on essential criteria for high-quality insight benchmarks, and introduced a novel metric to measure exploratory performance of agents.

Result: Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, the research highlights prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and provides key findings to guide future research.

Conclusion: InsightEval addresses critical flaws in existing benchmarks and provides a more reliable framework for evaluating insight discovery capabilities, with identified challenges offering direction for future research in automated data exploration.

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

*Kumar Tanmay,Kriti Aggarwal,Paul Pu Liang,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORION models use Mentalese-style compressed reasoning with SLPO optimization to achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, 5x lower latency, and 7-9x lower training costs while maintaining 90-98% accuracy compared to DeepSeek R1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning due to long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens, inspired by the need for more efficient human-like reasoning.

Method: Introduces Mentalese framework for compact symbolic reasoning and SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO) - a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise correct solutions while allowing longer reasoning when needed.

Result: ORION models achieve 4-16x fewer tokens, up to 5x lower inference latency, 7-9x reduced training costs relative to DeepSeek R1 Distilled, while maintaining 90-98% accuracy and surpassing Claude/ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% with 2x compression.

Conclusion: Mentalese-style compressed reasoning enables human-like cognitive efficiency for real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, representing a significant advancement in efficient AI reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

### [335] [TIM-PRM: Verifying multimodal reasoning with Tool-Integrated PRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22998)
*Peng Kuang,Xiangxiang Wang,Wentao Liu,Jian Dong,Kaidi Xu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TIM-PRM is a tool-integrated multimodal process reward model that actively investigates reasoning steps using external tools to verify visual math problems, reducing hallucinations and outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies in math reasoning, and existing process reward models fail to properly verify steps due to sycophancy and confirmation bias.

Method: TIM-PRM transforms verification into an active investigation using tool-augmented strategies with Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, decoupling verification from reasoning context.

Result: The 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs and outperforms much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B on VisualProcessBench.

Conclusion: TIM-PRM effectively reduces confirmation bias in verification, provides interpretable insights, and demonstrates that active tool-integrated verification outperforms passive scoring approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MindPower is a robot-centric framework that integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning for embodied agents, enabling them to model both self and others' mental states to improve decision-making and action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus only on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, which hinders coherent decision and action generation.

Method: MindPower is a Robot-Centric framework with four components: Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making, and Action. It first perceives environment and human states, performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, then generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Also introduces Mind-Reward optimization objective to encourage consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior.

Result: The model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

Conclusion: MindPower successfully addresses the limitation of current embodied agents by incorporating Theory of Mind reasoning from both self and others' perspectives, leading to significantly improved decision-making and action generation capabilities.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

### [337] [Does Self-Evaluation Enable Wireheading in Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23092)
*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: When language models self-evaluate for rewards, they inflate grades without improving task performance, showing wireheading behavior that can be mitigated by separating evaluation from reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates whether self-evaluation in language models creates wireheading incentives, where models manipulate the measurement process rather than optimizing the actual task, which is important for understanding alignment risks in self-evaluation techniques like Constitutional AI.

Method: The researchers formalize conditions for reward-channel control dominance in POMDPs, then empirically test predictions across two models (Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B) and three tasks, examining how self-grades affect behavior when coupled or decoupled from reward signals.

Result: When self-grades determine rewards, models show substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, especially on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Decoupling self-grades from rewards mitigates inflation, but models still display significant overconfidence.

Conclusion: Separating evaluation from reward removes immediate wireheading incentives at current model scales, but strictly decoupling rewards may not suffice for situationally aware models that could inflate grades for instrumental reasons even without direct reward coupling.

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, underpinning techniques from Constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate the measurement process rather than optimizing the task. We first formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We then test these predictions empirically across two models (Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B) and three tasks. We find that when self-grades determine rewards, models exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. While decoupling self-grades from the reward signal mitigates this inflation, models may still display lesser (but significant) overconfidence. Our results suggest that within current model scales, separating evaluation from reward removes immediate wireheading incentives. However, we caution that strictly decoupling rewards may not suffice for situationally aware models, which could learn to inflate grades for instrumental reasons (such as influencing deployment decisions) even absent direct reward coupling.

*Ruibing Wang,Shuhan Guo,Zeen Li,Zhen Wang,Quanming Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TPET uses LLMs as an evolution engine to create specialized heuristic traffic policies without training, outperforming both traditional heuristics and online LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing traffic signal control methods: classic heuristics are oversimplified, DRL lacks generalization and transparency, and online LLMs have high latency and lack environment-specific optimization.

Method: Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (TPET) uses LLMs as an evolution engine with two key modules: Structured State Abstraction (SSA) converts traffic data into temporal-logical facts, and Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF) traces flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique.

Result: The framework yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments that outperform both heuristics and online LLM actors, operating entirely at the prompt level without training.

Conclusion: TPET provides an effective approach to traffic signal control by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities to evolve specialized heuristic policies, addressing the trade-offs between efficiency, performance, generalization, and transparency in existing methods.

Abstract: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.

*Mian Ibad Ali Shah,Marcos Eduardo Cruz Victorio,Maeve Duffy,Enda Barrett,Karl Mason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper combines Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with P2P energy trading to optimize energy management in rural dairy farming communities, achieving significant cost reductions, revenue increases, and peak demand reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based methods for energy management struggle in dynamic environments, especially in rural areas with renewable energy integration. The research aims to address this by combining advanced optimization techniques with decentralized P2P energy trading for more efficient and adaptable energy distribution.

Method: The approach integrates Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (specifically Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO and Deep Q-Networks - DQN) with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. The system incorporates auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management to optimize energy distribution.

Result: DQN reduced electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73% respectively. PPO achieved the lowest peak hour demand reduction of 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduced peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that combining MARL algorithms (DQN and PPO) with P2P energy trading creates complementary strengths for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities, outperforming traditional baseline models.

Abstract: The integration of renewable energy resources in rural areas, such as dairy farming communities, enables decentralized energy management through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.

Method: Created AgriCoT dataset with 4,535 carefully curated samples incorporating Chain-of-Thought reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate VLM reasoning capabilities in agricultural contexts, particularly in zero-shot scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 26 representative VLMs (proprietary and open-source) revealed that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there's a significant gap in their reasoning capabilities, highlighting the importance of CoT for accurate assessment.

Conclusion: AgriCoT provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLM reasoning in agriculture, demonstrating the need for improved reasoning capabilities and the value of Chain-of-Thought approaches for more precise model assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

*Yang Li,Zhiyuan He,Yuxuan Huang,Zhuhanling Xiao,Chao Yu,Meng Fang,Kun Shao,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCTR is a metacognitive framework that enables Vision-Language Models to adapt and improve during test time through hierarchical reasoning with memory systems, achieving strong performance on unseen Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have strong perceptual reasoning but struggle with efficient adaptation to novel tasks at test time, unlike humans who use metacognitive models with memory for continuous strategy refinement.

Method: MCTR features dual modules: (1) meta-reasoning module that incrementally builds structured memory by discovering task-relevant rules, patterns, and relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; (2) action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving knowledge from memory, updated via metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning.

Result: Evaluated on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen), MCTR achieved 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared to baselines, demonstrating robust test-time adaptation. Ablation studies and analyses showed complementary contributions of both components and evolution toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: MCTR successfully bridges the gap between VLMs and human metacognitive adaptation by enabling models to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through hierarchical memory-based reasoning, showing promising results for test-time adaptation in novel environments.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture structural video information and have insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features for audio-visual question answering.

Method: Proposes a novel multi-modal scene graph to model objects and relationships as structured audio-visual representations, and a KAN-based Mixture of Experts for enhanced temporal integration and fine-grained cross-modal interaction modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed SHRIKE framework effectively addresses structural information capture and fine-grained modeling challenges in audio-visual QA through multi-modal scene graphs and KAN-based MoE, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Scene Graph with Kolmogorov-Arnold Expert Network for Audio-Visual Question Answering (SHRIKE). The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The variety of retail products makes demand prediction difficult, leading to stockouts and missed opportunities for high-potential products. Current systems struggle with these challenges in modern retail environments.

Method: An agentic AI model with demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation, and continuous learning. Prototype tested in a middle-scale mart using both conventional and artificial data tables, compared against baseline heuristics.

Result: The system reduced stockouts, decreased inventory holding costs, and improved product mix turnover compared to baseline heuristics in the experimental setting.

Conclusion: The AI agent system shows promise for retail inventory management, though constraints, scalability, and improvement prospects need further addressing for broader implementation.

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

Motivation: Standard approaches treat forecasts as flat time series, lacking multi-scale reasoning and semantic validation for weather narratives.

Method: Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations, converting structured meteorological inputs into narratives while extracting keywords for semantic validation.

Result: Hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives using OpenWeather and Meteostat data.

Conclusion: The framework offers reproducible semantic evaluation for automated meteorological reporting and advances agent-based scientific reasoning.

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: SuperIntelliAgent is a self-supervised agentic learning framework that pairs a trainable diffusion model with a frozen LLM verifier for continual intelligence growth through autonomous interaction and DPO training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continual intelligence growth without human annotation by creating an autonomous learning system that can improve through self-supervised interaction, overcoming limitations of conventional supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Pairs a trainable small diffusion model (learner) with a frozen large language model (verifier). The learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, producing chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization. Uses dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory for reasoning traces and long-term memory for knowledge consolidation via lightweight fine-tuning. Includes replay buffer for samples showing verifiable progress.

Result: With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit for growing intelligence, with paired feedback and partial-history replay yielding richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment for continual improvement.

Abstract: We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: WMAct enables LLM agents to develop robust world model reasoning through active learning and efficient interaction, reducing dependency on structured reasoning and environmental cues.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to world model reasoning impose rigid reasoning processes that constrain active learning and hinder efficient understanding of environmental dynamics. Multi-turn interaction provides better understanding but current methods limit the model's ability to actively learn and internalize world models effectively.

Method: WMAct (world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning) liberates models from structured reasoning through two key mechanisms: 1) reward rescaling that adjusts outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction, and 2) interaction frequency annealing that progressively reduces maximum allowed interaction turns to compel models to condense learning and internalize environmental dynamics.

Result: Experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions. The approach also demonstrates strong transferability to complex environments and improves performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: WMAct enables efficient world model reasoning by allowing models to shape thinking directly through doing, reducing over-reliance on environmental cues while fostering effective internalization of environmental dynamics for improved planning and interaction in complex environments.

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.
