*Arnav Gupta,Gurekas Singh Sahney,Hardik Rathi,Abhishek Chandwani,Ishaan Gupta,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven framework using Vision-Language Models to extract audiovisual features from short-form videos, cluster them into interpretable factors, and predict human engagement through regression, outperforming traditional quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video evaluation frameworks focus on surface-level quality metrics but fail to capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement, especially for short-form content where engagement is crucial.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models to extract unsupervised audiovisual features from short-form videos, clusters these features into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement metrics on a curated YouTube Shorts dataset.

Result: Strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement metrics, demonstrating that the lightweight feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments superior to traditional metrics like SSIM and FID.

Conclusion: The approach advances video understanding by grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, offering robust and explainable assessment of short-form video content.

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

*Albert Barreiro,Roger Marí,Rafael Redondo,Gloria Haro,Carles Bosch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShinyNeRF is a novel framework that improves 3D digitization of cultural heritage by accurately modeling both isotropic and anisotropic specular reflections, addressing limitations of existing NeRF methods with brushed metals and similar surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces like brushed metals, which is crucial for high-quality 3D digitization of cultural heritage artifacts with complex reflective properties.

Method: ShinyNeRF jointly estimates surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes using an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, approximating outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher distributions.

Result: ShinyNeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in digitizing anisotropic specular reflections while providing plausible physical interpretations and enabling material property editing compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ShinyNeRF represents a significant advancement in 3D digitization technology, successfully handling complex anisotropic reflections and offering practical benefits for cultural heritage preservation and material editing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

### [3] [A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21414)
*Christina Liu,Alan Q. Wang,Joy Hsu,Jiajun Wu,Ehsan Adeli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBF is a tool-use framework for medical image understanding that uses a learned Tool Bottleneck Model to compose VLM-selected tools via neural network fusion instead of text-based composition, improving performance especially in data-limited regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-use frameworks rely on text-based composition of tools, which performs poorly on medical images where salient information is spatially-localized and difficult to compose via text alone.

Method: Proposes Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF) with Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM) - uses off-the-shelf medical VLM to select clinically-relevant tools, then TBM computes and fuses tool outputs using neural network for final prediction.

Result: TBF performs on par with or better than deep learning classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks on histopathology and dermatology tasks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

Conclusion: The framework improves tool-use in medical imaging, yields more interpretable clinically-grounded predictors, and addresses limitations of text-based tool composition for spatially-localized medical image features.

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes. Our code is available at https://github.com/christinaliu2020/tool-bottleneck-framework.

*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDSNet is a scalable deep subspace clustering method that reduces complexity from O(n³) to O(n) using landmark approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices while maintaining clustering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subspace clustering methods face scalability limits due to O(n³) computational cost from constructing full n×n affinities and spectral decomposition. Deep learning approaches improve feature extraction but maintain this bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations.

Method: SDSNet achieves O(n) complexity through: (1) landmark-based approximation to avoid full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. Combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SDSNet provides a scalable deep subspace clustering framework that overcomes the O(n³) computational bottleneck while maintaining clustering performance through landmark approximation and joint optimization techniques.

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GPR image interpretation for subsurface road defect detection is heavily reliant on subjective expertise, leading to inefficiencies and inaccuracies. There's a need for automated, objective methods that can handle data scarcity and complex subsurface environments.

Method: Three-part framework: (1) DCGAN-based data augmentation to synthesize high-fidelity GPR images; (2) Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) with Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning for backbone network fine-tuning.

Result: MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). The model demonstrates robustness against Gaussian noise, weak signals, and small targets, outperforming other models in complex detection scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, successfully balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments, overcoming limitations of subjective interpretation and data scarcity.

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

### [6] [CCAD: Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21459)
*Xiao Jin,Liang Diao,Qixin Xiao,Yifan Hu,Ziqi Zhang,Yuchen Liu,Haisong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CCAD combines reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation methods for anomaly detection by using compressed global features as a condition for reconstruction, achieving better performance and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods have limitations: unsupervised representation methods struggle with domain shift, while reconstruction-based methods suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints.

Method: CCAD synergizes both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for reconstruction models, with an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance generalization and training efficiency.

Result: CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in AUC while achieving faster convergence, and includes a reorganized DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations for validation.

Conclusion: The proposed CCAD method effectively addresses limitations of existing approaches by combining their strengths, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

*Kumar Abhishek,Jeremy Kawahara,Ghassan Hamarneh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISIC MultiAnnot++ is the largest publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset with 17,684 masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, including annotator metadata for research on segmentation preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are currently no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation datasets for dermoscopic imaging, which is important for research but expensive to collect annotated data.

Method: Created ISIC MultiAnnot++ dataset by collecting 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images from the ISIC Archive, with 2,394 images having 2-5 segmentations per image, and including annotator metadata (skill level, segmentation tool).

Result: The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks across 14,967 dermoscopic images, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset, with curated data partitions and consensus segmentation masks.

Conclusion: ISIC MultiAnnot++ enables research on annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis, addressing the gap in multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation datasets for dermoscopic imaging.

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

### [8] [GPF-Net: Gated Progressive Fusion Learning for Polyp Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21476)
*Suncheng Xiang,Xiaoyang Wang,Junjie Jiang,Hejia Wang,Dahong Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gated Progressive Fusion network for colonoscopic polyp re-identification, using multi-level feature fusion with gating mechanisms to improve matching accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colonoscopic polyp re-identification is crucial for colorectal cancer prevention but suffers from inferior results for small polyps due to coarse high-level features losing detailed information needed for accurate matching.

Method: Introduces Gated Progressive Fusion network that selectively fuses features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way, with a gated progressive fusion strategy for layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show benefits over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed Gated Progressive Fusion network effectively addresses the challenge of polyp re-identification by selectively fusing multi-level features, improving matching accuracy for small polyps where detailed information is critical.

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

### [9] [Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495)
*Xinzhe Xie,Buyu Guo,Bolin Li,Shuangyan He,Yanzhen Gu,Qingyan Jiang,Peiliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFF is a two-stage generative multi-focus image fusion framework that first uses deterministic fusion (StackMFF V4) then generative restoration (IFControlNet) to create all-in-focus images, addressing edge artifacts and missing focal plane content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-focus image fusion methods assume every spatial location has at least one focused input image, and suffer from edge artifacts in complex real-world scenarios due to uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations.

Method: Two-stage cascaded framework: 1) Deterministic fusion using StackMFF V4 with focal plane information to produce initial fused image; 2) Generative restoration using IFControlNet (latent diffusion model) to reconstruct missing content, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts.

Result: GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and shows significant potential for practical applications, especially with complex multi-focal content. Implementation is publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed GMFF framework effectively addresses limitations of existing fusion methods by combining deterministic fusion with generative restoration, producing high-quality all-in-focus images without edge artifacts even in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [10] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the first benchmark for evaluating social reasoning in video generation, revealing that current models excel in visual realism but fail at understanding social cognition like intention recognition and belief reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models show impressive visual quality but lack social coherence - they can't infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, or social norms from visual cues like humans do. There's a need to systematically evaluate this gap between visual realism and social understanding.

Method: Developed a training-free agent-based pipeline that: (1) distills reasoning mechanisms from 30 classic social cognition paradigms organized into 7 dimensions, (2) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (3) enforces conceptual neutrality through cue-based critique, and (4) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across 5 interpretable dimensions.

Result: Large-scale evaluation across 7 state-of-the-art video generation systems reveals substantial performance gaps: models excel in surface-level plausibility but systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

Conclusion: The study establishes the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation and demonstrates that current models fundamentally lack social cognition capabilities despite their visual realism, highlighting a critical direction for future research in socially intelligent video generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [11] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient training (PET) methods like adapters and LoRA achieve near-state-of-the-art chest X-ray classification performance with 40x fewer parameters than full fine-tuning, but suffer from calibration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computational cost of fine-tuning large vision-language models for multimodal chest X-ray analysis while maintaining performance.

Method: Study PET strategies (frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, adapters) on Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset with pathology term redaction to prevent data leakage. Compare with full fine-tuning and conduct external validation on CheXpert dataset.

Result: PET methods achieve AUROC 0.892-0.908 with only 2.37M parameters (2.51% of total), outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC, 94.3M parameters). External validation shows scalability (>0.69 AUROC with <9% parameters). Vision-only models outperform budget-matched multimodal models, suggesting improvements come from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy.

Conclusion: Frozen encoder PET strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, but require calibration correction for clinical deployment as they show degraded calibration compared to simpler models.

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [12] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol for AI-generated image detectors to address misleading robustness estimates, revealing that ViTs maintain better performance under compression while CNNs excel on pristine photos, with hybrids providing balanced cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-generated image detection methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors like operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness, leading to misleading robustness estimates that mask deployment failures.

Method: Introduces a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds (selected once on clean validation data) fixed across all post-processing transformations, using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement, evaluated at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1).

Result: Frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos (93.33%) but collapse under compression (61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%). All architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) vs photorealistic images (0.747-0.759). Hybrid approach achieves 91.4% accuracy on photos, 89.7% on art/graphics, and 98.3% on CIFAKE.

Conclusion: Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and provides actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening, with semantic patterns providing fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts.

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

*Puyun Wang,Kaimin Yu,Huayang He,Xianyu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuS-Polar3D is a benchmark dataset for polarization-based underwater 3D imaging with controlled scattering conditions and multiple viewpoints, enabling fair comparison of reconstruction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polarization-based underwater 3D imaging datasets lack diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons between different reconstruction approaches.

Method: Constructed MuS-Polar3D dataset with 42 objects captured under 7 controlled scattering conditions and 5 viewpoints, providing polarization images, high-precision 3D models, normal maps, and foreground masks. Proposed a two-stage pipeline: descattering followed by 3D reconstruction.

Result: Extensive evaluations show effectiveness of the benchmark, achieving best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. Dataset supports multiple vision tasks including normal estimation, segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions.

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

*Henglin Liu,Huijuan Huang,Jing Wang,Chang Liu,Xiu Li,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses diversity degradation in GRPO-based image generation by proposing a distributional creativity bonus and structure-aware regularization to improve semantic diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GRPO methods suffer from homogenized outputs in later training stages, lacking creativity and visual diversity due to single-sample reward signals and misaligned regularization that neglects early-stage denoising's role in preserving diversity.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Distributional creativity bonus using spectral clustering over semantically grouped samples to allocate exploratory rewards based on group sizes, encouraging novel visual modes. 2) Structure-aware regularization with stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency.

Result: The method achieves 13-18% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses diversity degradation in GRPO by tackling both reward modeling and generation dynamics, enabling better quality-diversity trade-offs for practical image generation applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

*Jiayu Li,Rajesh Gangireddy,Samet Akcay,Wei Cheng,Juhua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language Models that enforces structural consistency in hierarchical classification with minimal parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require expensive full fine-tuning, producing inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels in hierarchical classification tasks.

Method: Combines Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) for vertical coherence along ground-truth label paths and Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) for consistent predictions among sibling classes, integrated with lightweight LoRA adaptation.

Result: Consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error across multiple benchmarks with minimal parameter overhead.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient strategy for adapting Vision-Language Models to structured taxonomies while maintaining hierarchical consistency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

*Dongchen Han,Tianyu Li,Ziyi Wang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Circulant Attention reduces self-attention's quadratic complexity to O(N log N) by modeling attention maps as Block Circulant matrices with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), maintaining model capacity while enabling efficient computation for vision Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention's quadratic complexity imposes heavy computational burden in high-resolution vision scenarios, limiting practical applications. Previous methods using handcrafted patterns like locality or sparsity compromise model capacity.

Method: Identifies that self-attention matrices in vision Transformers often approximate BCCB matrices. Explicitly models attention maps as nearest BCCB matrices and proposes efficient computation algorithm using circulant matrix properties for O(N log N) complexity.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate effectiveness. The approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention while achieving O(N log N) computation complexity and largely maintaining standard self-attention capacity.

Conclusion: Circulant attention presents a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures, offering efficient computation without significant capacity loss, making it practical for high-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

### [17] [EraseLoRA: MLLM-Driven Foreground Exclusion and Background Subtype Aggregation for Dataset-Free Object Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21545)
*Sanghyun Jo,Donghwan Lee,Eunji Jung,Seong Je Oh,Kyungsu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EraseLoRA is a dataset-free framework for object removal that uses background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation instead of attention manipulation to prevent target reappearance and reconstruct occluded background with structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object removal requires preventing masked targets from reappearing and reconstructing occluded background with structural/contextual fidelity, not just plausible hole filling. Current dataset-free approaches that manipulate self-attention fail by misinterpreting non-target foregrounds as background (causing unwanted object regeneration) and disrupting fine details through direct attention manipulation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE) uses multimodal LLMs to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from single image-mask pair without supervision. 2) Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA) performs test-time optimization treating inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces, enforcing consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives without explicit attention intervention.

Result: EraseLoRA demonstrates consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods across object removal benchmarks. It works as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset-free framework effectively addresses object removal challenges by replacing attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation, producing reliable background reconstruction while excluding distractors and preserving detail without explicit attention manipulation.

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

*Unnati Saraswat,Tarun Rao,Namah Gupta,Shweta Swami,Shikhar Sharma,Prateek Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two new tasks for advertising/digital media: context-aware object insertion and sponsor-product logo augmentation, with corresponding datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches using vision-language models and diffusion models often fail to ensure contextual appropriateness of inserted objects, particularly for advertising and digital media applications.

Method: The authors introduce two new tasks: (1) context-aware object insertion requiring prediction of suitable object categories, generation, and plausible placement; (2) sponsor-product logo augmentation involving product detection and correct brand logo insertion. They build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Result: The paper presents two new datasets designed to support the introduced tasks, containing necessary annotations for training and evaluation models for contextually appropriate object insertion and brand logo augmentation.

Conclusion: The work addresses important gaps in intelligent image editing for advertising and digital media by introducing context-aware tasks and providing datasets to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes reproducibility and generalizability issues in AI-generated content (AIGC) image detection, identifying key problems through literature review and experimental reproduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of AIGC image detection faces two core problems: poor reproducibility and insufficient generalizability, which hinder practical application of these technologies.

Method: The study reviews 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructs a lightweight test dataset, and reproduces a representative detection method to analyze reproducibility issues.

Result: Basic performance can be reproduced when strictly following core procedures, but detection performance drops sharply when preprocessing disrupts key features or when testing across different generators. The study identifies two root causes: omitted implicit details in papers and overfitting to exclusive features of specific generators.

Conclusion: This research provides empirical evidence for improving reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose experimental details more comprehensively and verify method generalizability.

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAid is a knowledge distillation method that transfers long-range attention capabilities from large to small vision-language models, enabling 3.2x longer effective context windows while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small vision-language models have limited window sizes that fail to capture linguistics-photography alignment, while large models demonstrate strong long-context understanding. The challenge is to transfer long-range attention capabilities from large to small models.

Method: LAid uses two complementary components: (1) progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed.

Result: LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models while maintaining or improving performance on standard vision-language benchmarks. Spectral analysis shows LAid preserves crucial low-frequency attention components.

Conclusion: LAid provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context vision-language models and offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based metrics show bias by favoring their own generations, while most LLM-free metrics lack high performance. There's a need for a neutral yet effective evaluation metric for image captions.

Method: Proposes Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric that learns representations of image-caption and caption-caption similarities. Also constructs a large human-annotated dataset with ~333k judgments from 2,360 annotators across 75k+ images.

Result: Pearl outperforms other existing LLM-free metrics on Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: Pearl provides an effective, unbiased alternative to LLM-based metrics for image caption evaluation, with strong performance across multiple benchmark datasets in both evaluation settings.

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: UltraLBM-UNet demonstrates suitability for point-of-care deployment by providing accurate, robust lesion segmentation with minimal computational resources, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity.

The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance.

TL;DR: ALARM is a label-free harmful meme detection framework using LMM agents that self-improve by learning from explicit memes to handle complex ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing harmful meme detection methods require large-scale labeled data, which demands substantial manual annotation and limits adaptability to evolving harmful content.

Method: ALARM uses Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification to isolate explicit memes with pseudo-labels, then employs Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement where explicit memes are organized into contrastive pairs to refine an LMM agent.

Result: Experiments on three diverse datasets show superior performance and strong adaptability to newly evolved memes, even outperforming label-driven methods.

Conclusion: ALARM demonstrates the potential of label-free frameworks as scalable solutions for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

Conclusion: GaussianEM offers an interpretable framework for analyzing complex macromolecular dynamics in cryo-EM data, addressing the challenge of modeling both continuous motions and discrete states simultaneously.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCMP is the first benchmark for evaluating Long-Context MLLM Personalization, assessing MLLMs' ability to handle personalized concepts in extended dialogues. TAME framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with double memories and RA2G paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM personalization methods focus only on simple visual identification and textual replacement, lacking support for long-context conversations where personalized concepts evolve over time. There's a need for benchmarks and methods that enable continual learning from dialogue histories for evolving personalized interactions.

Method: Proposes LCMP benchmark for evaluating long-context MLLM personalization, and TAME framework with double memories (temporal and persistent) to manage concept variations. TAME uses Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) to extract contextually fitted information from retrieved knowledge.

Result: TAME achieves best performance on LCMP benchmark, demonstrating remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios. The training-free approach shows strong capability in handling personalized concept variations.

Conclusion: LCMP addresses the gap in long-context MLLM personalization evaluation, while TAME provides an effective training-free framework for managing evolving personalized concepts through differentiated memory management and context-aware knowledge alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalFSFG introduces causal inference to address biased data distribution in few-shot fine-grained visual categorization by eliminating spurious correlations through sample-level and feature-level interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-FGVC methods overlook that support samples act as confounding variables, introducing biased data distribution and misleading discriminative feature extraction, which hampers performance.

Method: Proposes CausalFSFG with two components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) for sample-level interventions, and (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) for feature-level interventions, both designed to reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on widely-used public datasets including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars.

Conclusion: Causal inference effectively addresses biased data distribution in FS-FGVC by eliminating spurious correlations, leading to improved classification performance through causal interventions at both sample and feature levels.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Addressing the need for high-fidelity, controllable 3D simulation in autonomous driving to overcome long-tail data scarcity, while overcoming limitations of existing methods that struggle with photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing simultaneously.

Method: Proposes SymDrive with Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm: constructs paired symmetric views for detail recovery via ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation, uses auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation, and employs training-free harmonization for vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion, achieving photorealistic rendering with seamless lighting and shadow consistency.

Conclusion: SymDrive provides a unified solution for high-quality rendering and scene editing in autonomous driving simulation, effectively addressing challenges in large-angle novel view synthesis and geometric/lighting artifacts during asset manipulation.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the PPE framework for text-driven image manipulation, identifies limitations in its regularization strategy, and proposes a sparsity-based L1 constraint to reduce attribute entanglement and semantic leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute unintentionally alters other semantic properties like identity or appearance. The PPE framework addresses this but has limitations in its regularization strategy.

Method: The paper analyzes the PPE framework's architectural components (BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on CelebA-HQ). It identifies limitations in the original regularization strategy and introduces a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation to enforce more focused edits.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sparsity-based approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: The sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation improves the PPE framework by reducing attribute entanglement and semantic leakage, enabling more precise text-driven image editing.

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

TL;DR: TrackTeller is a temporal multimodal framework for 3D object grounding in driving scenes that uses LiDAR-image fusion and temporal reasoning to understand language references based on motion and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many referring expressions in driving scenes describe objects through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone, requiring temporal understanding.

Method: TrackTeller integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. It constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics.

Result: On the NuPrompt benchmark, TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, with 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Temporal reasoning is crucial for understanding natural-language references in dynamic 3D driving scenes, and TrackTeller's unified multimodal approach effectively addresses this challenge by leveraging motion history and short-term dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection models achieve high accuracy but remain opaque "black boxes" - we need to understand their internal decision processes for interpretability and robustness.

Method: Combines sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with novel forensic manifold analysis that probes feature responses to controlled forensic artifact manipulations.

Result: Only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer; geometric properties of the feature manifold (intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, feature selectivity) vary systematically with different deepfake artifacts.

Conclusion: Provides first steps toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, enabling identification of learned features corresponding to specific forensic artifacts and guiding development of more interpretable and robust models.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

Conclusion: YOLOv8s demonstrates superior performance in both efficiency and accuracy for autonomous vehicle perception tasks compared to YOLO-NAS, providing valuable insights for the research community.

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of verifying, reproducing, and auditing semantic outputs from vision-language models (VLMs) in educational contexts, particularly in high-stakes STEM domains where inconsistencies across models and environments undermine reliability.

Method: SlideChain uses a curated dataset of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides, extracts concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs, constructs structured provenance records, and anchors cryptographic hashes on a local EVM-compatible blockchain for tamper-evident auditability.

Result: The analysis reveals pronounced cross-model discrepancies including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples.

Conclusion: SlideChain provides a practical and scalable solution for trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical explanation for the collapse phenomenon in VGGT's global self-attention when processing long sequences (hundreds of frames), which causes attention matrices to become near rank-one and token geometry to degenerate.

Method: Viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process and proving that token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at O(1/L) rate, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that predicts the rank profile.

Result: The theory quantitatively matches empirically observed attention-heat-map evolution and explains why token-merging (periodically removing redundant tokens) slows the effective diffusion coefficient, delaying collapse without additional training.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a principled framework for interpreting scalable 3D-vision transformers and highlights potential for multi-modal generalization, offering mathematical understanding of attention collapse phenomena.

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information but faces data scarcity issues with paired, aligned datasets. Current deep learning models are limited by the lack of large paired multimodal datasets.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns from completely separate CT and MRI cohorts. Uses Quaternion Neural Networks for parameter efficiency and expressive power, with an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion block for bidirectional knowledge transfer between modalities.

Result: Jointly trained model on unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, exceeding unimodal nnU-Net baseline by 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Explainability analysis confirms clinically meaningful representations.

Conclusion: Provides a robust paradigm for leveraging large unpaired imaging archives in healthcare, enabling knowledge transfer between modalities without requiring paired data.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of macular edema in OCT images is crucial for clinical diagnosis but challenging due to ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity in OCT imaging.

Method: The framework uses a hybrid dual-path architecture integrating a generative prior pathway (variational autoencoder providing multi-scale anatomical priors) with a segmentation network. It incorporates densely connected blocks, spatial pyramid pooling, and a novel triple-attention mechanism guided by anatomical priors to dynamically modulate feature importance.

Conclusion: Prior-AttUNet demonstrates excellent segmentation performance across different OCT devices while maintaining computational efficiency, showing potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis of macular edema.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid video generation model with a Markov chain framework and recall mechanism to generate long, temporally consistent videos of hundreds/thousands of frames, overcoming quality degradation in existing methods when scaling video length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation models (GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Networks) typically produce only short sequences (up to 16 frames) and suffer from quality degradation when attempting to generate longer videos. There's a need for models that can generate meaningful, temporally consistent long video sequences while maintaining quality.

Method: 1. Proposes a VAE-GAN hybrid structure combining adversarial generation with variational encoding for inference capabilities. 2. Uses two processing branches for content and movement. 3. Extends this with a Markov chain framework where each state represents a VAE-GAN short-video generator. 4. Implements a recall mechanism to sequentially connect generated sub-sequences while maintaining temporal dependencies.

Result: The proposed model enables generation of long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames while ensuring temporal continuity, consistency, and dynamics. It overcomes the quality degradation problem faced by classical approaches when scaling video length.

Conclusion: The novel memory-efficient approach using Markov chain framework with recall mechanism successfully extends video generation capabilities to produce meaningful long sequences, addressing a key limitation in current video generation models.

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

TL;DR: InstructMoLE introduces instruction-guided global routing for diffusion transformers, replacing token-level routing with global expert selection to prevent spatial fragmentation and improve multi-conditional image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for diffusion transformers suffer from task interference with monolithic adapters like LoRA, and MoLE architectures have limited effectiveness due to token-level routing that conflicts with global user instructions, causing spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks.

Method: InstructMoLE uses Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR) that derives a global routing signal from user instructions to select a coherent expert council applied uniformly across all input tokens, plus an output-space orthogonality loss to promote expert functional diversity and prevent representational collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks, demonstrating superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Conclusion: InstructMoLE presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, addressing limitations of local routing by using global instruction guidance to preserve semantic and structural integrity in complex image generation tasks.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

TL;DR: ST-MoE: A novel spatiotemporal mixture-of-experts model using bidirectional Mamba for efficient multi-person motion prediction with reduced parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have two main limitations: 1) inflexible spatiotemporal representation relying on positional encodings, and 2) high computational costs from quadratic attention complexity. Need a more flexible and efficient approach for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion.

Method: Proposes Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE) with four distinct spatiotemporal experts specializing in different spatial/temporal dependencies. Uses bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations for efficiency and parameter economy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy on four multi-person benchmark datasets, reduces model parameters by 41.38%, and achieves 3.6x speedup in training.

Conclusion: ST-MoE effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion while significantly improving computational efficiency through the mixture-of-experts framework with bidirectional Mamba components.

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell detection in pathological images is challenging due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter, requiring specialized solutions.

Method: Built on VSSD backbone with CellMamba Blocks that integrate NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention with Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module, plus Adaptive Mamba Head for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines on CoNSeP and CytoDArk0 datasets while reducing model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: CellMamba provides an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection in biomedical images.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.

### [44] [RAPTOR: Real-Time High-Resolution UAV Video Prediction with Efficient Video Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21710)
*Zhan Chen,Zile Guo,Enze Zhu,Peirong Zhang,Xiaoxuan Liu,Lei Wang,Yidan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPTOR is a real-time high-resolution video prediction architecture that breaks the traditional trilemma between resolution, quality, and speed using efficient spatiotemporal factorization and a 3-stage training curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction faces a fundamental trilemma: high-resolution and perceptual quality come at the cost of real-time speed, which is critical for latency-sensitive applications like autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments. Existing methods fail to meet these demands on edge hardware.

Method: RAPTOR uses a single-pass design to avoid error accumulation. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling by alternating operations along spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes, reducing complexity from O((ST)^2) to O(S+T). It also employs a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp details.

Result: RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for 512² video, setting new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and custom high-resolution datasets in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. It boosts mission success rate in real-world UAV navigation by 18%.

Conclusion: RAPTOR breaks the long-standing trade-off in video prediction, enabling real-time high-resolution performance on edge hardware, which paves the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents like autonomous UAVs.

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

*Rahul Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict S&P 500 stock movements using multivariate raw market data including stock splits/dividends, treating historical data matrices as images for classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mathematical approaches dominate algorithmic trading, but recent deep learning advances show promise. Most existing research uses simplified single-dimensional financial data, lacking real-world complexity. This paper aims to use raw multivariate market data with all its complexities (including stock splits/dividends) to better capture real market dynamics.

Method: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), typically used for image classification, applied to multi-dimensional stock data. Treats historical data matrices as "images" (vectors of historical data matrices) for pattern recognition. Works with raw market data without feature engineering, including stock split/dividend events as-is.

Result: The model achieves promising results in predicting stock movements. The approach can be applied at multiple levels: individual stocks, sector-wise predictions, or entire portfolio predictions.

Conclusion: CNN can effectively process multivariate raw financial data by treating it as image-like structures, showing potential for improved stock movement prediction compared to traditional methods and simpler deep learning approaches.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AstraNav-World is an end-to-end world model that jointly predicts future visual states and action sequences using a unified probabilistic framework with diffusion-based video generation and vision-language policy, improving embodied navigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments requires accurate foresight of world evolution and action sequences. Current approaches often use decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines that suffer from cumulative errors and lack tight coupling between visual predictions and action planning.

Method: Proposes AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model integrating a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy within a unified probabilistic framework. Uses synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions update simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals.

Result: Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training. Real-world testing demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to unseen scenarios without real-world fine-tuning.

Conclusion: AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics rather than overfitting to simulation data. By unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, it moves toward reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents for open-ended real-world settings.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

*Steven Xiao,XIndi Zhang,Dechao Meng,Qi Wang,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Knot Forcing is a novel streaming framework for real-time portrait animation that enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent generation over infinite sequences with ultra-low latency on consumer GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time portrait animation needs high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control, but existing approaches have limitations: diffusion models are non-causal (not suitable for streaming), while causal autoregressive methods suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency.

Method: Three key designs: (1) chunk-wise generation with global identity preservation via cached KV states of reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; (3) "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference to keep semantic context ahead of current rollout frame for long-term coherence.

Result: Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Conclusion: The proposed Knot Forcing framework successfully addresses challenges in real-time portrait animation by combining chunk-wise generation, temporal knot smoothing, and running ahead mechanisms to achieve streaming deployment with high quality and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

*Md Rafid Islam,Rafsan Jany,Akib Ahmed,Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-level fusion of CNN backbones (EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121) improves binary diabetic retinopathy screening accuracy on heterogeneous fundus images while maintaining practical inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy screening faces challenges due to limited specialist availability and variable image quality across different devices and populations, requiring accurate and efficient automated solutions.

Method: Used 11,156 fundus images from five public datasets, compared three pretrained CNN models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants for binary DR classification across five independent runs.

Result: Fusion consistently outperformed single backbones. EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 fusion achieved best mean accuracy (82.89%) with balanced F1-scores (normal: 83.60%, diabetic: 82.60%). EfficientNet-B0 was fastest (1.16 ms/image), while fusion offered best accuracy-latency balance.

Conclusion: Lightweight feature fusion enhances generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SyncAnyone is a two-stage AI video dubbing framework that achieves accurate lip-sync while maintaining visual quality, identity preservation, and background consistency by combining masked mouth inpainting with mask-free tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based video dubbing methods disrupt spatiotemporal context, causing instability in facial structure and background consistency while focusing on lip-sync accuracy. There's a need for a solution that simultaneously achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity.

Method: Two-stage learning framework: Stage 1 trains a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting to generate audio-driven lip movements. Stage 2 develops a mask-free tuning pipeline using synthetic data from pseudo-paired training samples to address mask-induced artifacts and improve background consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the-wild lip-syncing scenarios, overcoming limitations of previous mask-based approaches.

Conclusion: SyncAnyone successfully addresses the limitations of mask-based training by combining accurate lip-sync generation with high visual fidelity through a novel two-stage approach, achieving superior performance in real-world video dubbing applications.

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Studenikina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BertsWin: A hybrid SSL architecture combining BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows for 3D medical imaging, achieving 5.8x faster convergence and 15x reduction in training epochs while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE) struggle with 3D volumetric medical images due to difficulty capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when discarding 75% of tokens during pre-training. There's a need for better SSL methods that preserve 3D spatial topology while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking with Swin Transformer windows. Unlike classic MAE which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible) to preserve spatial topology. Uses single-level local Swin windows to handle quadratic complexity of ViT. Also introduces a structural priority loss function and GradientConductor optimizer.

Result: BertsWin achieves 5.8x faster semantic convergence compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. When combined with GradientConductor optimizer, achieves 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines at canonical input resolutions, resulting in significant net reduction in total computational resources.

Conclusion: BertsWin successfully addresses the limitations of standard MAE for 3D medical imaging by preserving complete 3D spatial topology while maintaining computational efficiency. The architecture enables faster convergence and reduced training requirements without computational penalty, making SSL more practical for 3D volumetric medical image analysis.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised brain MRI lesion detection framework using disentangled representation and edge-to-image restoration to improve generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center data and suppress abnormal residuals in reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection methods for brain MRI have limited generalizability across different imaging modalities and centers, and suffer from performance constraints due to abnormal residuals propagating from input images to reconstructed pseudo-healthy images.

Method: Two novel modules: 1) Disentangled representation module that decouples brain MRI into imaging information and essential anatomical images using brain anatomical priors and differentiable one-hot encoding for stability. 2) Edge-to-image restoration module that reconstructs high-quality pseudo-healthy images by restoring anatomical representation from edge information and recoupling imaging information.

Result: Outperformed 17 state-of-the-art methods on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current unsupervised methods by improving generalizability across multi-modality/multi-center data and suppressing abnormal residuals, leading to superior lesion detection performance in brain MRI.

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

TL;DR: LVLM-VA method uses Large Vision Language Models to align small vision models with human domain knowledge, reducing reliance on spurious correlations and biases without fine-grained feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small task-specific vision models often rely on spurious correlations rather than aligning with human domain knowledge, leading to brittle real-world behavior despite having explainable results.

Method: LVLM-VA (LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment) creates a bidirectional interface using Large Vision Language Models to translate model behavior into natural language and map human class-level specifications to image-level critiques for expert-model interaction.

Result: The method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications on both synthetic and real-world datasets, effectively reducing dependence on spurious features and group-specific biases.

Conclusion: LVLM-VA provides an efficient way to align small vision models with human domain knowledge using LVLMs, addressing the problem of spurious correlations without requiring fine-grained feedback from domain experts.

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

TL;DR: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned vision-language model for video scene segmentation that jointly processes visual and textual cues, uses sequential processing with causal dependencies, and achieves state-of-the-art performance with explainable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing encoder-based methods for video scene segmentation have visual-centric biases, process shots in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, lack narrative understanding, and lack explainability for boundary decisions.

Method: Scene-VLM is a fine-tuned vision-language model framework that jointly processes visual frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata. It uses sequential processing with causal dependencies among shots, a context-focus window mechanism for temporal context, extracts confidence scores from token-level logits, and can generate natural-language rationales through minimal targeted supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM represents the first fine-tuned VLM framework for video scene segmentation that overcomes limitations of existing methods by enabling multimodal reasoning, sequential processing with causal dependencies, controllable precision-recall trade-offs, and explainable decision-making through natural-language rationales.

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

TL;DR: LongFly is a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for UAV vision-and-language navigation that addresses challenges in long-horizon navigation by transforming fragmented historical data into structured representations, improving semantic alignment and path planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV vision-and-language navigation methods struggle with modeling long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex post-disaster environments, leading to inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning due to high information density, rapid viewpoint changes, and dynamic structures.

Method: LongFly uses a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy with three key modules: 1) slot-based historical image compression to distill multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations, 2) spatiotemporal trajectory encoding to capture temporal dynamics and spatial structure, and 3) prompt-guided multimodal integration to combine spatiotemporal context with current observations for time-based reasoning and waypoint prediction.

Result: LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89% in success rate and 6.33% in success weighted by path length, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across both seen and unseen environments.

Conclusion: The proposed LongFly framework effectively addresses long-horizon spatiotemporal context modeling challenges in UAV vision-and-language navigation, providing more accurate semantic alignment and stable path planning for post-disaster search and rescue applications.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

TL;DR: A two-stage autoregressive framework adapts diffusion models for real-time interactive avatars with full-body gestures, achieving SOTA performance in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based avatar methods are non-causal and computationally expensive for streaming, while current interactive approaches only handle head-and-shoulder regions without full-body gestures.

Method: Two-stage autoregressive adaptation with autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement, featuring Reference Sink, Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR), and Consistency-Aware Discriminator for long-term stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness, producing both talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables real-time, interactive human avatars with full-body gestures, overcoming limitations of existing diffusion-based and interactive approaches.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study diffusion posterior sampling for single-image super-resolution under known degradation models, enabling stable high-quality reconstructions without retraining diffusion models for each operator.

Method: Implement likelihood-guided sampling combining unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for 4× super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise.

Result: Best configuration achieved at PS scale 0.95 and noise σ=0.01 (score 1.45231), restoring sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to downsampled inputs.

Conclusion: Balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength is crucial for stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining diffusion models for each operator.

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

*Mengqi He,Xinyu Tian,Xin Shen,Jinhong Ni,Shu Zou,Zhaoyuan Yang,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which target only high-entropy tokens (critical decision points) in autoregressive VLMs to achieve effective attacks with smaller perturbation budgets while exposing significant safety vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and while entropy correlates with model uncertainty, prior attacks treat all tokens equally. The authors discovered that only about 20% of high-entropy tokens disproportionately control output trajectories, suggesting more efficient attack strategies could reveal deeper safety flaws.

Method: Proposed Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA) that selectively concentrate adversarial perturbations on critical high-entropy tokens rather than all tokens. This approach identifies vulnerable decision points in autoregressive generation and exploits them with smaller perturbation budgets.

Result: EGA achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) while converting 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones across multiple VLMs. The method also shows transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets) and reveals recurring vulnerable high-entropy forks across diverse VLM architectures.

Conclusion: Selective attacks on critical high-entropy tokens expose significant safety vulnerabilities in VLMs, challenging the assumption that all tokens contribute equally to generation instability. The findings reveal new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms and suggest the need for more robust defenses against targeted adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incremental learning methods freeze old model parameters but ignore structural efficiency issues, leading to feature differences between modules and class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. There's a need for efficient model expansion as categories increase in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes SCL-PNC with: 1) demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion using adapt-layers, 2) dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework that adapts to incremental classes, 3) parallel expansion framework with knowledge distillation to align features across expansion modules and counteract feature drift.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The approach successfully addresses class misalignment and ensures feature consistency while enabling scalable expansion.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC provides an effective solution for scalable class-incremental learning by leveraging neural collapse principles with expandable backbone, adapt-layers, and parametric ETF classifiers to handle evolving class distributions while maintaining feature consistency and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

Includes Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to suppress background interference, Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) for spatial alignment, and Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) for inter-modal dependency integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show TPS-SCL achieves state-of-the-art performance among lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches on various datasets.

Conclusion: TPS-SCL effectively addresses real-world unaligned RGB-T SOD challenges through efficient alignment and correlation learning, demonstrating superior performance with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

TL;DR: ADT-Tree accelerates autoregressive image generation by dynamically adjusting draft tree structure based on spatial prediction difficulty, achieving 3x speedup over baseline AR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from slow sequential inference (~2000 steps for 576x576 images). While speculative decoding with draft trees works for LLMs, it underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty across different image regions.

Method: Proposes Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree) that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. Initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, creating deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones.

Result: Empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate speedups of 3.13x and 3.05x respectively. The method integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods like LANTERN for further acceleration.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree effectively addresses the spatial prediction difficulty problem in visual AR models, achieving significant inference acceleration while maintaining quality, with potential for further speedup through integration with relaxed sampling techniques.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIOR is a training-free method that uses large vision-language models to generate conditional image embeddings by prompting the model to describe images with single words related to given conditions, outperforming existing baselines including CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision foundation models like CLIP provide rich image representations but aren't designed to focus on specific conditional aspects (e.g., color, genre) indicated by textual conditions. There's a need for methods that can generate embeddings focusing on particular image attributes without requiring additional training.

Method: DIOR leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) in a training-free approach. It prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition, then extracts the hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token as the conditional image embedding. This works for any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors.

Result: DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines including CLIP on conditional image similarity tasks. It also achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Conclusion: DIOR provides a versatile, training-free solution for generating conditional image embeddings that can focus on specific aspects of images indicated by textual conditions, demonstrating strong performance across various settings without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte: A unified end-to-end video omnimatte method that finetunes a video inpainting diffusion model with dual complementary experts (Effect Expert and Quality Expert) for high-quality foreground layer decomposition with associated effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video omnimatte methods rely on slow, multi-stage pipelines that fail to fully exploit generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. The authors aim to create a more efficient and effective unified approach.

Method: Finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model with dual experts: 1) Effect Expert with LoRA applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture foreground and associated effects, and 2) Quality Expert with full LoRA finetuning to refine alpha mattes. During sampling, Effect Expert handles early high-noise steps while Quality Expert handles later low-noise steps.

Result: EasyOmnimatte sets new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency. The Dual-Expert strategy is validated through ablation studies, and the method enables various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed EasyOmnimatte provides a unified, end-to-end solution for video omnimatte that effectively captures both foreground layers and associated effects while being computationally efficient, representing a significant advancement over previous methods.

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

TL;DR: DPAR is a decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into variable-sized patches based on information content, reducing computational costs while improving image generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoder-only autoregressive image generation suffers from quadratic growth in token counts with resolution, leading to high computational and memory demands in attention mechanisms.

Method: DPAR uses next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight unsupervised autoregressive model as a criterion to merge tokens into larger patches dynamically, allocating more compute to high-information regions while maintaining compatibility with standard decoder architectures.

Result: DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 resolutions, achieving up to 40% FLOPs reduction in training, faster convergence, and up to 27.1% relative improvement in FID compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DPAR demonstrates that dynamic patch aggregation based on information content enables efficient high-quality image generation while reducing computational costs, with potential for multimodal generation frameworks.

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain is a new fMRI foundation model that improves both data- and training-efficiency through a two-stage adaptive design with temporal saliency ranking and 4D hierarchical encoding, achieving SOTA performance with only 4k pre-training sessions and 30% GPU memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI foundation models face dual bottlenecks: atlas-based methods lose spatial details and need large cohorts, while atlas-free methods preserve spatial fidelity but are too memory/compute-intensive for large-scale pre-training.

Method: Two-stage adaptive design: (1) lightweight temporal extractor captures global context and ranks data windows by saliency, (2) 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from top-k selected windows while deleting ~70% masked patches.

Result: Establishes new state-of-the-art performance across seven public benchmarks, requires only 4 thousand pre-training sessions, and uses approximately 30% of GPU memory compared to traditional voxel-level methods.

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain successfully addresses the dual efficiency bottlenecks in fMRI foundation models by combining temporal saliency selection with hierarchical encoding, enabling effective atlas-free modeling with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

TL;DR: Reloc-VGGT is a novel visual localization framework that uses early-fusion multi-view spatial integration instead of traditional late-fusion approaches, enabling robust real-time camera pose estimation in both structured and unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual localization uses pair-wise pose regression with late-fusion strategies that are insufficient for effective spatial integration and degrade in complex environments. The authors aim to create a more robust system that can handle both structured and unstructured environments through better spatial information integration.

Method: The framework uses VGGT backbone for multi-view 3D geometry encoding, introduces a pose tokenizer and projection module to exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views, and implements a novel sparse mask attention strategy to reduce computational cost from quadratic to more manageable complexity for real-time performance.

Result: Trained on approximately 8 million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments.

Conclusion: Reloc-VGGT represents the first visual localization framework with early-fusion multi-view spatial integration, offering superior performance over traditional late-fusion methods. The sparse mask attention enables real-time operation at scale, and the system shows excellent generalization to unseen environments.

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

TL;DR: A DiT-based framework for high-fidelity, long-duration human animation videos with improved facial/hand details and arbitrary-length generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with long-duration video generation and lack fine-grained facial/hand details, limiting real-world high-quality applications.

Method: 1) Hybrid implicit guidance signals + sharpness guidance for facial/hand details; 2) Position Shift Adaptive Module for arbitrary-length videos; 3) Data augmentation + skeleton alignment for identity shape variations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

Conclusion: Proposed framework successfully addresses limitations in long-duration video generation and fine-grained detail synthesis for human animation.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

TL;DR: PAN is a human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition that fuses RGB and skeleton data by representing RGB patches containing human joints as spatiotemporal graphs, enabling more effective multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton data suffer from inherent heterogeneity between modalities and fail to fully exploit their complementary potential, requiring a more effective fusion approach.

Method: Proposes PAN framework with human-centric graph modeling where token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. Includes attention-based post calibration to reduce dependency on high-quality skeletal data. Presents two variants: PAN-Ensemble (dual-path GCNs with late fusion) and PAN-Unified (unified graph representation in single network).

Result: Both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art performance on three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets in their respective settings (separate and unified modeling).

Conclusion: PAN provides an effective human-centric graph representation learning framework that enables more semantically coherent fusion of RGB and skeleton modalities for action recognition, achieving SOTA performance through both ensemble and unified approaches.

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation and optimization of product posters is labor-intensive and resource-consuming. There's a need for an automated system that can generate appealing posters and optimize them based on online performance without human intervention.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Generator with unified design module integrates background, text, and layout elements, then element rendering module encodes these into condition tokens for controllable poster generation. 2) Optimizer enhances CTR using online feedback by systematically replacing elements for fine-grained comparisons and using Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements.

Conclusion: AutoPP provides an effective automated solution for product poster generation and optimization, eliminating manual effort while improving performance through data-driven optimization based on real user feedback.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DRU framework for low-light enhancement in anime scenery images using data relativistic uncertainty to handle illumination uncertainty and improve perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses domain gap in low-light enhancement for anime scenery images, which is underexplored compared to natural images/videos, and tackles data scarcity in this domain.

Method: Constructs unpaired anime scenery dataset, proposes Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework inspired by Relativistic GAN, quantifies illumination uncertainty using wave-particle duality analogy, and dynamically adjusts objective functions based on uncertainty.

Result: DRU framework trained with EnlightenGANs yields superior perceptual and aesthetic quality compared to state-of-the-art methods that don't learn from data uncertainty perspective.

Conclusion: DRU framework provides novel data-centric learning paradigm for visual and language domains, effectively handling illumination uncertainty in anime scenery enhancement.

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method finds compact spectral indices for vegetation classification using polynomial combinations of pairwise normalized differences, achieving high accuracy with simple, interpretable indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated approach for finding compact, interpretable spectral indices for vegetation classification that maintain illumination invariance needed in remote sensing applications.

Method: Generate all pairwise normalized differences from spectral bands, build polynomial combinations up to fixed degree, then apply feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, L1-regularized SVM) to select compact index sets.

Result: Single degree-2 index (product of two normalized differences from red-edge bands) achieved 96.26% accuracy for Kochia detection; eight indices reached 97.70%. Features consistently involved degree-2 products from bands b4-b8, indicating spectral interactions are key.

Conclusion: The automated framework successfully finds compact, interpretable spectral indices that capture discriminative signals through spectral interactions rather than individual band ratios, with potential for broad application across sensors and classification tasks.

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMSF-A is a lightweight multi-scale attention framework for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, achieving high accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs while maintaining stability under small-batch training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy is challenging due to narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is constrained by limited surgical hardware, requiring models to balance accuracy and speed while remaining stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training.

Method: LMSF-A co-designs backbone, neck, and head components. Backbone uses C2f-Pro module combining RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA). Neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE). Head adopts Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm.

Result: LMSF-A is highly competitive or better than other methods in all evaluation metrics, requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs. It generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark. The authors also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset with 61 patients and 610 images.

Conclusion: LMSF-A provides an effective solution for real-time instance segmentation in spinal endoscopy, balancing accuracy and speed while being lightweight and stable under small-batch training conditions. The released PELD dataset supports further research in this domain.

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALEAHallu is an adversarial parametric editing framework that identifies and fine-tunes hallucination-prone parameter clusters in VLMs to reduce visual-text misalignment by forcing models to prioritize visual evidence over linguistic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from persistent hallucination issues where outputs misalign with visual inputs, attributed to over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration. Existing heuristic decoding calibration strategies are non-trainable and have limited optimization potential.

Method: Proposes an Activate-Locate-Edit Adversarially (ALEA) paradigm: 1) Construct activation dataset with grounded (visual-anchored) and hallucinatory (LLM bias-based) responses; 2) Identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states; 3) Fine-tune clusters using adversarial prefixes optimized to maximize visual neglect, forcing visual evidence prioritization.

Result: Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate significant effectiveness in alleviating hallucinations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ALEAHallu provides a trainable parametric editing framework that effectively mitigates VLM hallucinations by targeting and modifying specific parameter clusters responsible for visual-text misalignment, outperforming non-trainable calibration strategies.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

TL;DR: iSHIFT is a lightweight 2.5B multimodal agent that uses implicit chain-of-thought reasoning with perception control to switch between slow (detailed visual grounding) and fast (global cues) modes for GUI interaction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with balancing efficiency for routine GUI tasks and precision for fine-grained interactions requiring exact visual grounding. They also remain large and lack adaptive reasoning depth based on task complexity.

Method: iSHIFT integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module using special perception tokens. This allows switching between slow mode (detailed visual grounding) and fast mode (global cues) while guiding attention to relevant screen regions.

Result: Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets for GUI interaction tasks.

Conclusion: iSHIFT demonstrates that lightweight multimodal agents can achieve strong performance through adaptive reasoning modes and visual attention mechanisms, balancing efficiency and precision for GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

*Zongmin Zhang,Zhen Sun,Yifan Liao,Wenhan Dong,Xinlei He,Xingshuo Han,Shengmin Xu,Xinyi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BadVSFM is a novel backdoor attack framework specifically designed for prompt-driven video segmentation foundation models that overcomes the ineffectiveness of traditional backdoor attacks by using a two-stage training approach to achieve strong, controllable backdoor effects while maintaining clean segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) like SAM2 are widely deployed in critical applications, raising security concerns about backdoor threats. However, traditional backdoor attacks are ineffective on VSFMs (ASR < 5%), creating a need for specialized attack methods that can exploit vulnerabilities in these models.

Method: BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) Steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a target embedding while clean frames align with a reference encoder; (2) Train the mask decoder so triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask across prompt types, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder.

Result: Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. The attack is robust to hyperparameter changes and existing defenses remain largely ineffective against it.

Conclusion: BadVSFM reveals a significant vulnerability in current VSFMs by successfully implementing backdoor attacks through a two-stage approach that separates triggered and clean representations, shifting attention to trigger regions. This exposes an underexplored security threat in widely deployed segmentation models.

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

Result: New SOTA across benchmarks: 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, 49.2% on UI-Vision (surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8). Mobile navigation: 76.7% on AndroidWorld (surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed1.8) and 41.7% on MobileWorld. Online RL scaling shows +5.2 points from 32 to 512 parallel environments and +4.3 points from 15 to 50 environment steps. Device-cloud system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud calls by 40%, preserves privacy.

Conclusion: MAI-UI successfully addresses key GUI agent deployment challenges through its unified methodology, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while demonstrating practical benefits of device-cloud collaboration and scalable online RL optimization.

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework called \method generates interactive, continuous worlds from single images or text prompts using diffusion models with real-time performance and text control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based world generation methods suffer from large parameter sizes, slow inference, growing historical context issues, and lack text-controlled generation capabilities, limiting real-time performance.

Method: \method uses three core components: 1) long-video generation with unified context compression and linear attention, 2) real-time streaming acceleration via bidirectional attention distillation and enhanced text embedding, and 3) text-controlled world event generation.

Result: The framework generates realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from single images or text prompts with keyboard-based exploration capabilities and real-time performance.

Conclusion: \method addresses key limitations of previous diffusion-based world generation methods by enabling text-controlled, real-time interactive world generation with efficient architecture design.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds. However, most of these methods face critical challenges such as excessively large parameter sizes, reliance on lengthy inference steps, and rapidly growing historical context, which severely limit real-time performance and lack text-controlled generation capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose \method, a novel framework designed to generate realistic, interactive, and continuous worlds from a single image or text prompt. \method achieves this through a carefully designed framework that supports keyboard-based exploration of the generated worlds. The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

### [81] [Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105)
*Momir Adžemović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDLP is a tracking-by-detection method that uses link prediction between tracks and detections for per-frame association, learning from data without handcrafted rules while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-object tracking has two paradigms: tracking-by-detection methods are efficient but rely on handcrafted heuristics, while end-to-end methods learn association from data but are computationally complex. There's a need for a method that combines the efficiency of tracking-by-detection with the data-driven learning of end-to-end approaches.

Method: Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP) performs per-frame association via link prediction between existing tracks and new detections. It predicts the correct continuation of each track at every frame. The architecture primarily uses geometric features like bounding boxes, with optional incorporation of additional cues such as pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Analysis reveals link prediction is more effective than metric learning-based association, especially when handling heterogeneous features like detection bounding boxes.

Conclusion: TDLP successfully bridges the gap between heuristic-based tracking-by-detection and computationally complex end-to-end methods by providing a modular, efficient approach that learns association from data through link prediction, achieving superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

*Zhi Ouyang,Dian Zheng,Xiao-Ming Wu,Jian-Jian Jiang,Kun-Yu Lin,Jingke Meng,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProEdit improves inversion-based visual editing by addressing over-reliance on source information through KV-mix attention mechanism and Latents-Shift perturbation, enabling better attribute changes while maintaining consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inversion-based editing methods overly rely on source image information during sampling, which negatively affects target image edits by failing to properly change subject attributes like pose, number, or color as instructed.

Method: ProEdit addresses the issue in two aspects: 1) Attention aspect: KV-mix mixes KV features of source and target in edited regions to mitigate source influence while maintaining background consistency. 2) Latent aspect: Latents-Shift perturbs the edited region of source latent to eliminate inverted latent influence on sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The method is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods like RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Conclusion: ProEdit effectively addresses the over-reliance on source information in inversion-based editing, enabling better attribute changes while maintaining editing consistency, with practical plug-and-play integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

*Shuoshuo Zhang,Yizhen Zhang,Jingjing Fu,Lei Song,Jiang Bian,Yujiu Yang,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS) improves vision-language models by using bidirectional where-to-look signals to shape perception during training, addressing limitations of existing visual cue mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models rely on intermediate visual cues that overlook fine-grained visual evidence, generalize poorly across domains, and have high inference costs. There's a need for better perceptual training that enforces visual reliance and prevents text-only shortcuts.

Method: BiPS transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional signals: 1) KL-consistency constraint between original image and evidence-preserving view (keeping only question-relevant regions) for coarse coverage, and 2) KL-separation constraint between original and evidence-ablated view (masking critical pixels) to prevent text-only shortcuts and enforce fine-grained visual reliance.

Result: BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average across eight benchmarks and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Conclusion: BiPS effectively shapes perception in vision-language models through bidirectional constraints, improving performance while enforcing proper visual reliance and preventing shortcuts.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

### [84] [Teaching People LLM's Errors and Getting it Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21422)
*Nathan Stringham,Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori,Xinyuan Yan,Zhichao Xu,Bei Wang,Ana Marasović*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why teaching users about LLM failure patterns hasn't successfully reduced overreliance, finding that failure patterns exist but automated discovery methods are inconsistent, and proposes a better metric for measuring teaching effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People over-rely on LLMs because they see impressive capabilities but don't realize LLMs can fail on basic tasks. Prior work tried to teach users about failure patterns to reduce overreliance, but this approach hasn't been successful, so the paper aims to understand why.

Method: 1) Examined whether failure patterns exist by grouping instances by meta-labels and evaluating LLM performance; 2) Tested if prompting and embedding-based methods can surface known failures; 3) Proposed a new metric to assess users' ability to anticipate LLM failures; 4) Conducted a user study to evaluate teaching effectiveness with the new metric.

Result: 1) Failure patterns do exist (sizable groups where LLMs are error-prone); 2) Automated failure-discovery methods show mixed results; 3) User study shows positive effect from teaching when using the proposed metric (ability to anticipate failures), unlike traditional human-AI team accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: Teaching failure patterns could mitigate overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using appropriate metrics like the proposed ability-to-anticipate-failures metric rather than just human-AI team accuracy.

Abstract: People use large language models (LLMs) when they should not. This is partly because they see LLMs compose poems and answer intricate questions, so they understandably, but incorrectly, assume LLMs won't stumble on basic tasks like simple arithmetic. Prior work has tried to address this by clustering instance embeddings into regions where an LLM is likely to fail and automatically describing patterns in these regions. The found failure patterns are taught to users to mitigate their overreliance. Yet, this approach has not fully succeeded. In this analysis paper, we aim to understand why.
  We first examine whether the negative result stems from the absence of failure patterns. We group instances in two datasets by their meta-labels and evaluate an LLM's predictions on these groups. We then define criteria to flag groups that are sizable and where the LLM is error-prone, and find meta-label groups that meet these criteria. Their meta-labels are the LLM's failure patterns that could be taught to users, so they do exist. We next test whether prompting and embedding-based approaches can surface these known failures. Without this, users cannot be taught about them to reduce their overreliance. We find mixed results across methods, which could explain the negative result. Finally, we revisit the final metric that measures teaching effectiveness. We propose to assess a user's ability to effectively use the given failure patterns to anticipate when an LLM is error-prone. A user study shows a positive effect from teaching with this metric, unlike the human-AI team accuracy. Our findings show that teaching failure patterns could be a viable approach to mitigating overreliance, but success depends on better automated failure-discovery methods and using metrics like ours.

*Geoffroy Morlat,Marceau Nahon,Augustin Chartouny,Raja Chatila,Ismael T. Freire,Mehdi Khamassi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMETH framework integrates probabilistic context learning with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes acceptability of ambiguous actions, achieving ~60% alignment with human judgments vs ~30% for end-to-end LLM prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Moral judgments depend not just on outcomes but on contextual factors, yet current approaches (especially end-to-end LLMs) lack transparency and alignment with human moral reasoning about ambiguous actions in different contexts.

Method: Created dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions; collected ternary judgments from 101 participants; used LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means for action clustering; developed probabilistic context learner with divergence criteria; added Generalization module with binary contextual features and transparent likelihood-based model.

Result: COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments compared to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while providing interpretable feature weights that explain which contextual factors drive predictions.

Conclusion: COMETH offers an interpretable, empirically grounded alternative to black-box LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction, combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics for better alignment and transparency.

Abstract: Moral actions are judged not only by their outcomes but by the context in which they occur. We present COMETH (Contextual Organization of Moral Evaluation from Textual Human inputs), a framework that integrates a probabilistic context learner with LLM-based semantic abstraction and human moral evaluations to model how context shapes the acceptability of ambiguous actions. We curate an empirically grounded dataset of 300 scenarios across six core actions (violating Do not kill, Do not deceive, and Do not break the law) and collect ternary judgments (Blame/Neutral/Support) from N=101 participants. A preprocessing pipeline standardizes actions via an LLM filter and MiniLM embeddings with K-means, producing robust, reproducible core-action clusters. COMETH then learns action-specific moral contexts by clustering scenarios online from human judgment distributions using principled divergence criteria. To generalize and explain predictions, a Generalization module extracts concise, non-evaluative binary contextual features and learns feature weights in a transparent likelihood-based model. Empirically, COMETH roughly doubles alignment with majority human judgments relative to end-to-end LLM prompting (approx. 60% vs. approx. 30% on average), while revealing which contextual features drive its predictions. The contributions are: (i) an empirically grounded moral-context dataset, (ii) a reproducible pipeline combining human judgments with model-based context learning and LLM semantics, and (iii) an interpretable alternative to end-to-end LLMs for context-sensitive moral prediction and explanation.

*Soichiro Murakami,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Hiroya Takamura,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Oogiri-Master benchmark and Oogiri-Corpus dataset to rigorously evaluate humor understanding in LLMs using Japanese creative response game, addressing limitations of previous humor datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humor serves as a testbed for human-like creative thinking in LLMs, but existing datasets have limitations: few candidate responses per prompt, exposure to popularity signals during ratings, and lack of objective metrics for funniness.

Method: Created Oogiri-Master benchmark and Oogiri-Corpus dataset with ~100 diverse candidate responses per prompt, rated independently by ~100 human judges without access to others' ratings to reduce popularity bias. Analyzed linguistic factors (text length, ambiguity, incongruity resolution) and derived objective metrics for predicting human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs approach human performance on the benchmark, and insight-augmented prompting improves model performance. The analysis identified linguistic factors associated with funniness and derived objective metrics for predicting human judgments.

Conclusion: The Oogiri-Master benchmark and Oogiri-Corpus dataset provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs, addressing previous dataset limitations and enabling rigorous assessment of creative thinking capabilities.

Abstract: Humor is a salient testbed for human-like creative thinking in large language models (LLMs). We study humor using the Japanese creative response game Oogiri, in which participants produce witty responses to a given prompt, and ask the following research question: What makes such responses funny to humans? Previous work has offered only limited reliable means to answer this question. Existing datasets contain few candidate responses per prompt, expose popularity signals during ratings, and lack objective and comparable metrics for funniness. Thus, we introduce Oogiri-Master and Oogiri-Corpus, which are a benchmark and dataset designed to enable rigorous evaluation of humor understanding in LLMs. Each prompt is paired with approximately 100 diverse candidate responses, and funniness is rated independently by approximately 100 human judges without access to others' ratings, reducing popularity bias and enabling robust aggregation. Using Oogiri-Corpus, we conduct a quantitative analysis of the linguistic factors associated with funniness, such as text length, ambiguity, and incongruity resolution, and derive objective metrics for predicting human judgments. Subsequently, we benchmark a range of LLMs and human baselines in Oogiri-Master, demonstrating that state-of-the-art models approach human performance and that insight-augmented prompting improves the model performance. Our results provide a principled basis for evaluating and advancing humor understanding in LLMs.

*Changzhi Sun,Xiangyu Chen,Jixiang Luo,Dell Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that reframes memory management in LLMs as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, moving beyond heuristic approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current memory management in large language models relies on hand-designed heuristics that fail to account for long-term consequences and uncertainty. Memory decisions (what to read/write) affect future retrieval and downstream behavior in unpredictable ways, creating a need for a more principled approach.

Method: DAM decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. It uses value functions and uncertainty estimators to evaluate candidate operations, enabling an aggregate policy to make decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework rather than empirical results. DAM provides a principled reframing that clarifies limitations of heuristic approaches and establishes a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

Conclusion: Memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty. DAM offers a decision-theoretic framework that enables better handling of delayed utility and risk in memory systems, paving the way for more sophisticated memory architectures in LLMs.

Abstract: External memory is a key component of modern large language model (LLM) systems, enabling long-term interaction and personalization. Despite its importance, memory management is still largely driven by hand-designed heuristics, offering little insight into the long-term and uncertain consequences of memory decisions. In practice, choices about what to read or write shape future retrieval and downstream behavior in ways that are difficult to anticipate. We argue that memory management should be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the utility of memory is delayed and dependent on future interactions. To this end, we propose DAM (Decision-theoretic Agent Memory), a decision-theoretic framework that decomposes memory management into immediate information access and hierarchical storage maintenance. Within this architecture, candidate operations are evaluated via value functions and uncertainty estimators, enabling an aggregate policy to arbitrate decisions based on estimated long-term utility and risk. Our contribution is not a new algorithm, but a principled reframing that clarifies the limitations of heuristic approaches and provides a foundation for future research on uncertainty-aware memory systems.

*Emmy Liu,Varun Gangal,Chelsea Zou,Xiaoqi Huang,Michael Yu,Alex Chang,Zhuofu Tao,Sachin Kumar,Steven Y. Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper provides a unified definition of hallucination in language models as inaccurate internal world modeling that becomes observable to users, and proposes synthetic benchmarks to test and improve world modeling capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite numerous attempts, hallucination remains a persistent problem in even frontier large language models. The authors aim to unify disparate definitions of hallucination in the literature and provide a clear framework for understanding, evaluating, and addressing this issue.

Method: The authors analyze historical and current definitions of hallucination from the literature and fold them into a single unified definition. They propose that hallucination is fundamentally inaccurate internal world modeling that becomes observable to users. They then outline plans for synthetic benchmarks where hallucinations are defined as mismatches with fully specified world models in different environments.

Result: The paper presents a unified framework for understanding hallucination that clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination, provides common language for comparing benchmarks and mitigation techniques, and enables more precise evaluation by forcing clear specification of assumed "world" or source of truth.

Conclusion: The unified definition of hallucination as inaccurate world modeling provides a foundation for developing better benchmarks that can stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models, potentially leading to more effective mitigation strategies for this persistent problem.

Abstract: Despite numerous attempts to solve the issue of hallucination since the inception of neural language models, it remains a problem in even frontier large language models today. Why is this the case? We walk through definitions of hallucination used in the literature from a historical perspective up to the current day, and fold them into a single definition of hallucination, wherein different prior definitions focus on different aspects of our definition. At its core, we argue that hallucination is simply inaccurate (internal) world modeling, in a form where it is observable to the user (e.g., stating a fact which contradicts a knowledge base, or producing a summary which contradicts a known source). By varying the reference world model as well as the knowledge conflict policy (e.g., knowledge base vs. in-context), we arrive at the different existing definitions of hallucination present in the literature.
  We argue that this unified view is useful because it forces evaluations to make clear their assumed "world" or source of truth, clarifies what should and should not be called hallucination (as opposed to planning or reward/incentive-related errors), and provides a common language to compare benchmarks and mitigation techniques. Building on this definition, we outline plans for a family of benchmarks in which hallucinations are defined as mismatches with synthetic but fully specified world models in different environments, and sketch out how these benchmarks can use such settings to stress-test and improve the world modeling components of language models.

TL;DR: Gamayun is a 1.5B-parameter multilingual LLM trained on 2.5T tokens with a novel two-stage pre-training strategy that achieves SOTA results for its size, outperforming larger models like LLaMA3.2-1B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on English and multilingual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of research on small, efficient non-English-centric language models suitable for resource-constrained environments, with special focus on Russian language support.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: 1) balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, 2) high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Trained from scratch on 2.5T tokens.

Result: Outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all benchmarks; surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on English and multilingual tasks; matches/exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) outside advanced STEM; achieves SOTA in Russian including MERA benchmark among 1-2B parameter models.

Conclusion: Gamayun demonstrates that efficient, small multilingual models can achieve competitive performance with significantly less training data than larger models, providing a practical solution for resource-constrained deployments while advancing non-English language support.

Abstract: We present Gamayun, a 1.5B-parameter multilingual language model trained entirely from scratch on 2.5T tokens. Designed for efficiency and deployment in resource-constrained environments, Gamayun addresses the lack of research on small non-English-centric LLMs by adopting a novel two-stage pre-training strategy: balanced multilingual training for cross-lingual alignment, followed by high-quality English enrichment to transfer performance gains across languages. Our model supports 12 languages, with special focus on Russian. Despite a significantly smaller training budget than comparable models, Gamayun outperforms LLaMA3.2-1B (9T tokens) on all considered benchmarks, and surpasses Qwen2.5-1.5B (18T tokens) on a wide range of English and multilingual tasks. It matches or exceeds Qwen3 (36T tokens) on most tasks outside advanced STEM, achieving state-of-the-art results in Russian, including the MERA benchmark, among the models of comparable size (1-2B parameters).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HIC-Bench is a novel evaluation framework that categorizes LLM hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (creative/valuable) and Defective Hallucinations (errors), enabling systematic study of their interplay in LLM creativity across scientific domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection focuses only on factual consistency, failing to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. There's a need to quantify the creative or epistemically valuable content in some hallucinations that remains understudied.

Method: Proposes HIC-Bench with three core features: 1) Structured IH/DH assessment using multi-dimensional metrics combining TTCT creativity metrics with hallucination-specific dimensions, 2) Cross-domain applicability across ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks, and 3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization using DHP to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. Uses multiple LLM judges with human verification.

Result: Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. Shows IH can act as a catalyst for creativity and LLM hallucinations can drive scientific innovation.

Conclusion: HIC-Bench provides a systematic framework to study the creative potential of LLM hallucinations, positioning intelligent hallucinations as valuable for scientific innovation rather than just errors to be minimized. Offers a platform for advancing research into LLM creative intelligence.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) are commonly regarded as errors to be minimized. However, recent perspectives suggest that some hallucinations may encode creative or epistemically valuable content, a dimension that remains underquantified in current literature. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily focus on factual consistency, struggling to handle heterogeneous scientific tasks and balance creativity with accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose HIC-Bench, a novel evaluation framework that categorizes hallucinations into Intelligent Hallucinations (IH) and Defective Hallucinations (DH), enabling systematic investigation of their interplay in LLM creativity. HIC-Bench features three core characteristics: (1) Structured IH/DH Assessment. using a multi-dimensional metric matrix integrating Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) metrics (Originality, Feasibility, Value) with hallucination-specific dimensions (scientific plausibility, factual deviation); (2) Cross-Domain Applicability. spanning ten scientific domains with open-ended innovation tasks; and (3) Dynamic Prompt Optimization. leveraging the Dynamic Hallucination Prompt (DHP) to guide models toward creative and reliable outputs. The evaluation process employs multiple LLM judges, averaging scores to mitigate bias, with human annotators verifying IH/DH classifications. Experimental results reveal a nonlinear relationship between IH and DH, demonstrating that creativity and correctness can be jointly optimized. These insights position IH as a catalyst for creativity and reveal the ability of LLM hallucinations to drive scientific innovation.Additionally, the HIC-Bench offers a valuable platform for advancing research into the creative intelligence of LLM hallucinations.

Motivation: Human conversation follows implicit chains of thought manifested as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is essential for building natural full-duplex interactive systems that can understand and participate in human-like dialogue.

Method: Introduces a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT) framework that formalizes intent-to-action pathways with hierarchical labeling (high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts). Uses a hybrid corpus pairing controllable simulations with human annotations and real speech. A multimodal transformer structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph to forecast next speech acts and generate justifications.

Result: The framework demonstrates robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full-duplex spoken dialogue systems across both synthetic and real duplex dialogues.

Conclusion: The GoT framework successfully models causal inference in conversation, enabling natural full-duplex interactive systems with interpretable reasoning capabilities, advancing the field of conversational AI.

Abstract: Human conversation is organized by an implicit chain of thoughts that manifests as timed speech acts. Capturing this causal pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that enables reasoning over conversational behaviors by modeling this process as causal inference within a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a hybrid corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich simulations with human-annotated rationales and real conversational speech. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a multimodal transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.

TL;DR: MoR-Agent: A parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLM agents using Mixture-of-Roles with specialized LoRA groups for reasoner, executor, and summarizer roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent tasks remain largely unexplored despite recent advancements in fine-tuning LLMs for agent tasks. Current approaches lack specialized, efficient adaptation methods tailored for the distinct capabilities required in agent systems.

Method: Three key strategies: 1) Decompose agent capabilities into three roles (reasoner, executor, summarizer) based on Reason+Action paradigm; 2) Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework with three specialized LoRA groups for each role; 3) Multi-role data generation pipeline with role-specific content completion and reliability verification for effective fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The framework shows improved performance in agent tasks through specialized role-based adaptation.

Conclusion: The MoR-Agent framework provides an effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for LLM agents by decomposing agent capabilities into specialized roles and using role-specific LoRA adaptations, enabling collaborative task completion while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to facilitate agent tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies for agent remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce three key strategies for PEFT in agent tasks: 1) Inspired by the increasingly dominant Reason+Action paradigm, we first decompose the capabilities necessary for the agent tasks into three distinct roles: reasoner, executor, and summarizer. The reasoner is responsible for comprehending the user's query and determining the next role based on the execution trajectory. The executor is tasked with identifying the appropriate functions and parameters to invoke. The summarizer conveys the distilled information from conversations back to the user. 2) We then propose the Mixture-of-Roles (MoR) framework, which comprises three specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) groups, each designated to fulfill a distinct role. By focusing on their respective specialized capabilities and engaging in collaborative interactions, these LoRAs collectively accomplish the agent task. 3) To effectively fine-tune the framework, we develop a multi-role data generation pipeline based on publicly available datasets, incorporating role-specific content completion and reliability verification. We conduct extensive experiments and thorough ablation studies on various LLMs and agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This project is publicly available at https://mor-agent.github.io.

TL;DR: This paper investigates AI-generated text detection in Bengali using transformer models, finding that fine-tuned models achieve ~91% accuracy while zero-shot approaches perform near chance levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in AI-generated text detection for Bengali language, which remains largely unexplored despite concerns about misuse of LLMs for disinformation and content manipulation. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make detection particularly challenging.

Method: The study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. It evaluates both zero-shot performance and task-specific fine-tuning approaches for distinguishing human-written from AI-generated Bengali text.

Result: Zero-shot evaluation shows all models perform near chance levels (~50% accuracy). Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance.

Conclusion: This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content. The findings highlight the necessity of task-specific fine-tuning for effective detection in Bengali.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can produce text that closely resembles human writing. This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.

*Yuyi Zhang,Boyu Tang,Tianjie Ju,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COCONUT's latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders that promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the internal mechanisms of latent tokens in LLMs from a reliability perspective, examining whether they encode faithful reasoning or function as uninterpretable placeholders.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Steering experiments perturbing specific token subsets (COCONUT vs explicit CoT) to test sensitivity and reasoning-critical information; 2) Shortcut experiments evaluating models under biased and out-of-distribution settings on MMLU and HotpotQA.

Result: COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information, unlike CoT tokens. COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning.

Conclusion: COCONUT is a pseudo-reasoning mechanism that generates plausible traces concealing shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

Abstract: Latent tokens are gaining attention for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet their internal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper examines the problem from a reliability perspective, uncovering fundamental weaknesses: latent tokens function as uninterpretable placeholders rather than encoding faithful reasoning. While resistant to perturbation, they promote shortcut usage over genuine reasoning. We focus on Chain-of-Continuous-Thought (COCONUT), which claims better efficiency and stability than explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while maintaining performance. We investigate this through two complementary approaches. First, steering experiments perturb specific token subsets, namely COCONUT and explicit CoT. Unlike CoT tokens, COCONUT tokens show minimal sensitivity to steering and lack reasoning-critical information. Second, shortcut experiments evaluate models under biased and out-of-distribution settings. Results on MMLU and HotpotQA demonstrate that COCONUT consistently exploits dataset artifacts, inflating benchmark performance without true reasoning. These findings reposition COCONUT as a pseudo-reasoning mechanism: it generates plausible traces that conceal shortcut dependence rather than faithfully representing reasoning processes.

*Rui Ke,Jiahui Xu,Shenghao Yang,Kuang Wang,Feng Jiang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CATCH is a unified framework for theme detection in dialogues that integrates context-aware topic representation, preference-guided clustering, and hierarchical generation to address challenges in cross-dialogue consistency and personalized user preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theme detection methods struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues, creating challenges for cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences.

Method: CATCH integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation that enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering that jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback; and (3) hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels.

Result: Experiments on the multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

Conclusion: CATCH provides a unified framework that addresses key challenges in theme detection by integrating contextualized clustering and hierarchical generation, showing promising results for user-centric dialogue systems.

Abstract: Theme detection is a fundamental task in user-centric dialogue systems, aiming to identify the latent topic of each utterance without relying on predefined schemas. Unlike intent induction, which operates within fixed label spaces, theme detection requires cross-dialogue consistency and alignment with personalized user preferences, posing significant challenges. Existing methods often struggle with sparse, short utterances for accurate topic representation and fail to capture user-level thematic preferences across dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose CATCH (Controllable Theme Detection with Contextualized Clustering and Hierarchical Generation), a unified framework that integrates three core components: (1) context-aware topic representation, which enriches utterance-level semantics using surrounding topic segments; (2) preference-guided topic clustering, which jointly models semantic proximity and personalized feedback to align themes across dialogue; and (3) a hierarchical theme generation mechanism designed to suppress noise and produce robust, coherent topic labels. Experiments on a multi-domain customer dialogue benchmark (DSTC-12) demonstrate the effectiveness of CATCH with 8B LLM in both theme clustering and topic generation quality.

TL;DR: Ara-HOPE is a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework for Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic translation that addresses limitations of existing metrics through a structured error taxonomy and annotation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks fail to adequately capture dialect-specific MT errors in DA-MSA translation, hindering progress in translation assessment and system improvement.

Method: Developed Ara-HOPE framework with a five-category error taxonomy and decision-tree annotation protocol for systematic human evaluation of DA-MSA translation quality through post-editing analysis.

Result: Comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Jais, GPT-3.5, NLLB-200) revealed systematic performance differences, with dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation identified as the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation.

Conclusion: Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems, addressing critical gaps in current translation assessment methods.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic (DA-MSA) translation is a challenging task in Machine Translation (MT) due to significant lexical, syntactic, and semantic divergences between Arabic dialects and MSA. Existing automatic evaluation metrics and general-purpose human evaluation frameworks struggle to capture dialect-specific MT errors, hindering progress in translation assessment. This paper introduces Ara-HOPE, a human-centric post-editing evaluation framework designed to systematically address these challenges. The framework includes a five-category error taxonomy and a decision-tree annotation protocol. Through comparative evaluation of three MT systems (Arabic-centric Jais, general-purpose GPT-3.5, and baseline NLLB-200), Ara-HOPE effectively highlights systematic performance differences between these systems. The results show that dialect-specific terminology and semantic preservation remain the most persistent challenges in DA-MSA translation. Ara-HOPE establishes a new framework for evaluating Dialectal Arabic MT quality and provides actionable guidance for improving dialect-aware MT systems.

Motivation: To test whether domain-specific training (successful in text models like SciBERT) could also work for figure captions, and to improve scientific figure captioning through systematic research and tool development.

Method: Curated and released large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on generated and author-written captions, navigated LLM developments, launched annual challenges, and built interactive captioning systems.

Result: SciCap grew into a central effort shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape, becoming a multi-institution collaboration with continuous dataset updates and comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper summarizes key technical and methodological lessons from the first 5 years of SciCap and outlines five major unsolved challenges with proposed directions for future research in scientific figure captioning.

Abstract: Between 2021 and 2025, the SciCap project grew from a small seed-funded idea at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) into one of the central efforts shaping the scientific figure-captioning landscape. Supported by a Penn State seed grant, Adobe, and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, what began as our attempt to test whether domain-specific training, which was successful in text models like SciBERT, could also work for figure captions expanded into a multi-institution collaboration. Over these five years, we curated, released, and continually updated a large collection of figure-caption pairs from arXiv papers, conducted extensive automatic and human evaluations on both generated and author-written captions, navigated the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), launched annual challenges, and built interactive systems that help scientists write better captions. In this piece, we look back at the first five years of SciCap and summarize the key technical and methodological lessons we learned. We then outline five major unsolved challenges and propose directions for the next phase of research in scientific figure captioning.

*Vitthal Bhandari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of 20 recent papers on cultural bias in NLP reveals gaps in stakeholder engagement and proposes concrete frameworks for conceptualizing and evaluating bias harms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research on cultural bias in LLMs often fails to engage with real-world stakeholders, missing the fundamental problem of societal impact. There's a need for more robust assessment frameworks that connect technical bias detection with actual harms experienced by affected communities.

Method: Literature review of 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias in NLP, inspired by previous work (arXiv:2005.14050v2). Analysis focused on identifying patterns, gaps, and developing concrete observations for better bias conceptualization and evaluation.

Result: Identified key observations about current approaches to cultural bias in NLP research, highlighting the disconnect between technical bias detection and stakeholder engagement. Developed frameworks for more concrete bias conceptualization and effective harm evaluation.

Conclusion: NLP researchers need to move beyond technical bias detection to engage with stakeholders and assess real societal impacts. The proposed observations provide guidance for more robust evaluation of cross-cultural bias harms in language technologies.

Abstract: Research has shown that while large language models (LLMs) can generate their responses based on cultural context, they are not perfect and tend to generalize across cultures. However, when evaluating the cultural bias of a language technology on any dataset, researchers may choose not to engage with stakeholders actually using that technology in real life, which evades the very fundamental problem they set out to address.
  Inspired by the work done by arXiv:2005.14050v2, I set out to analyse recent literature about identifying and evaluating cultural bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I picked out 20 papers published in 2025 about cultural bias and came up with a set of observations to allow NLP researchers in the future to conceptualize bias concretely and evaluate its harms effectively. My aim is to advocate for a robust assessment of the societal impact of language technologies exhibiting cross-cultural bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeMe framework enables LLMs to adaptively generate new task-execution methods for IoT systems by decorating method-generation paths with behavioral principles, experience, and environmental feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based IoT systems lack systematic ability to produce new methods for unseen situations and rely on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Method: Method Decoration (DeMe) modifies LLM method-generation paths using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Decorations are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences, enabling path reshuffling through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion.

Result: Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive more appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

Conclusion: DeMe provides a general framework for producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods in intelligent IoT systems, overcoming limitations of traditional rule augmentation approaches.

Abstract: Intelligent IoT systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate task-execution methods for dynamic environments. However, existing approaches lack the ability to systematically produce new methods when facing previously unseen situations, and they often depend on fixed, device-specific logic that cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.In this paper, we propose Method Decoration (DeMe), a general framework that modifies the method-generation path of an LLM using explicit decorations derived from hidden goals, accumulated learned methods, and environmental feedback. Unlike traditional rule augmentation, decorations in DeMe are not hardcoded; instead, they are extracted from universal behavioral principles, experience, and observed environmental differences. DeMe enables the agent to reshuffle the structure of its method path-through pre-decoration, post-decoration, intermediate-step modification, and step insertion-thereby producing context-aware, safety-aligned, and environment-adaptive methods. Experimental results show that method decoration allows IoT devices to derive ore appropriate methods when confronting unknown or faulty operating conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve knowledge reasoning in the specialized domain of tobacco pest and disease control by integrating structured graph information with large language models, addressing limitations of traditional LLMs in handling complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning tasks in domain-specific applications.

Method: 1) LLM-assisted construction of tobacco pest/disease knowledge graph with entities (diseases, symptoms, control methods) and relationships; 2) GraphRAG framework for knowledge retrieval and integration; 3) Transformer architecture as core inference model; 4) GNN for learning expressive node representations capturing local/global relational information; 5) ChatGLM backbone fine-tuned with LoRA for parameter-efficient adaptation.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both accuracy and depth of reasoning, with particularly strong performance in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: Integrating graph-structured information with LLMs via the GraphRAG framework effectively enhances knowledge reasoning in domain-specific applications like tobacco pest/disease control, demonstrating the value of combining structured knowledge representation with language models for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large language model (LLM) approach that integrates graph-structured information for knowledge reasoning in tobacco pest and disease control. Built upon the GraphRAG framework, the proposed method enhances knowledge retrieval and reasoning by explicitly incorporating structured information from a domain-specific knowledge graph. Specifically, LLMs are first leveraged to assist in the construction of a tobacco pest and disease knowledge graph, which organizes key entities such as diseases, symptoms, control methods, and their relationships. Based on this graph, relevant knowledge is retrieved and integrated into the reasoning process to support accurate answer generation. The Transformer architecture is adopted as the core inference model, while a graph neural network (GNN) is employed to learn expressive node representations that capture both local and global relational information within the knowledge graph. A ChatGLM-based model serves as the backbone LLM and is fine-tuned using LoRA to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, significantly improving both the accuracy and depth of reasoning, particularly in complex multi-hop and comparative reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: The work provides valuable resources for Arabic-English MT research, demonstrates the limitations of traditional alignment methods on complex texts, and shows the superiority of LLM-based approaches for sentence alignment in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality parallel corpora are essential for Machine Translation (MT) research and translation teaching. However, Arabic-English resources remain scarce and existing datasets mainly consist of simple one-to-one mappings. In this paper, we present AlignAR, a generative sentence alignment method, and a new Arabic-English dataset comprising complex legal and literary texts. Our evaluation demonstrates that "Easy" datasets lack the discriminatory power to fully assess alignment methods. By reducing one-to-one mappings in our "Hard" subset, we exposed the limitations of traditional alignment methods. In contrast, LLM-based approaches demonstrated superior robustness, achieving an overall F1-score of 85.5%, a 9% improvement over previous methods.

TL;DR: HeartBench is a framework for evaluating Chinese LLMs' anthropomorphic intelligence across emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions using authentic psychological counseling scenarios and expert-developed rubrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show persistent deficits in anthropomorphic intelligence (social, emotional, ethical navigation), especially in Chinese context where specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data are lacking.

Method: Developed with clinical experts, uses authentic psychological counseling scenarios structured around theory-driven taxonomy (5 primary dimensions, 15 secondary capabilities). Implements case-specific, rubric-based methodology with "reasoning-before-scoring" protocol to translate abstract traits into measurable criteria.

Result: Evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs shows substantial performance ceiling - leading models achieve only 60% of expert-defined ideal score. Performance decays significantly in "Hard Set" scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs.

Conclusion: HeartBench establishes standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data to address LLMs' limitations in social-emotional intelligence.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in cognitive and reasoning benchmarks, they exhibit a persistent deficit in anthropomorphic intelligence-the capacity to navigate complex social, emotional, and ethical nuances. This gap is particularly acute in the Chinese linguistic and cultural context, where a lack of specialized evaluation frameworks and high-quality socio-emotional data impedes progress. To address these limitations, we present HeartBench, a framework designed to evaluate the integrated emotional, cultural, and ethical dimensions of Chinese LLMs. Grounded in authentic psychological counseling scenarios and developed in collaboration with clinical experts, the benchmark is structured around a theory-driven taxonomy comprising five primary dimensions and 15 secondary capabilities. We implement a case-specific, rubric-based methodology that translates abstract human-like traits into granular, measurable criteria through a ``reasoning-before-scoring'' evaluation protocol. Our assessment of 13 state-of-the-art LLMs indicates a substantial performance ceiling: even leading models achieve only 60% of the expert-defined ideal score. Furthermore, analysis using a difficulty-stratified ``Hard Set'' reveals a significant performance decay in scenarios involving subtle emotional subtexts and complex ethical trade-offs. HeartBench establishes a standardized metric for anthropomorphic AI evaluation and provides a methodological blueprint for constructing high-quality, human-aligned training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TimeBill is a time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that adaptively adjusts KV cache eviction ratios to meet varying time constraints while maintaining response quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in time-critical systems (robotics, autonomous driving, etc.) where generating accurate responses within specific time budgets is crucial for safety and decision-making. Current methods struggle with modeling execution time and adapting to varying time constraints with fixed KV cache eviction strategies.

Method: Proposes TimeBill framework with: 1) Fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict end-to-end LLM execution time; 2) Time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time predictions and given time budgets.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate TimeBill's advantages in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: TimeBill effectively addresses the challenge of time-budgeted LLM inference by balancing efficiency and response quality through adaptive KV cache management, making LLMs more suitable for time-critical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in time-critical systems, such as robotics, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and industrial automation, where generating accurate responses within a given time budget is crucial for decision-making, control, or safety-critical tasks. However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.

Conclusion: Quicker has significant potential to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions by automating evidence synthesis and supporting clinical decision-making processes.

Abstract: Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.

TL;DR: LVLMs struggle with copyright compliance when processing copyrighted visual content, even with copyright notices present. A new benchmark dataset and tool-augmented defense framework are proposed to address this critical issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread accessibility of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement when they process copyrighted content like book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation. Failure to comply with copyright regulations could lead to serious legal and ethical consequences.

Method: 1) Created a comprehensive benchmark dataset of 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs covering copyrighted materials with and without copyright notices; 2) Evaluated various LVLMs on their ability to handle copyrighted content; 3) Introduced a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance.

Result: State-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting copyrighted content, even when presented with copyright notices. The proposed defense framework effectively reduces infringement risks across all scenarios.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need to develop copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content. The proposed benchmark and defense framework provide important tools for addressing this critical issue in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, their widespread accessibility raises critical concerns about potential copyright infringement. Will LVLMs accurately recognize and comply with copyright regulations when encountering copyrighted content (i.e., user input, retrieved documents) in the context? Failure to comply with copyright regulations may lead to serious legal and ethical consequences, particularly when LVLMs generate responses based on copyrighted materials (e.g., retrieved book experts, news reports). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of various LVLMs, examining how they handle copyrighted content -- such as book excerpts, news articles, music lyrics, and code documentation when they are presented as visual inputs. To systematically measure copyright compliance, we introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 multimodal query-content pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LVLMs handle queries that could lead to copyright infringement. Given that real-world copyrighted content may or may not include a copyright notice, the dataset includes query-content pairs in two distinct scenarios: with and without a copyright notice. For the former, we extensively cover four types of copyright notices to account for different cases. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art closed-source LVLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in recognizing and respecting the copyrighted content, even when presented with the copyright notice. To solve this limitation, we introduce a novel tool-augmented defense framework for copyright compliance, which reduces infringement risks in all scenarios. Our findings underscore the importance of developing copyright-aware LVLMs to ensure the responsible and lawful use of copyrighted content.

### [106] [CricBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs in Cricket Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21877)
*Vaibhav Devraj,Dhruv Kumar,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CricBench: A bilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs on cricket-specific Text-to-SQL tasks, revealing domain specialization challenges and surprising Hindi performance advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket analytics requires complex statistical insights not available through standard searches. LLMs have advanced in Text-to-SQL but their ability to handle domain-specific nuances, complex schemas, and multilingual requirements in sports analytics remains unexplored.

Method: Created CricBench - a comprehensive benchmark suite with "Gold Standard" dataset manually authored by cricket and SQL domain experts. Constructed benchmark in both English and Hindi, evaluating six state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, open-source models) using strict evaluation protocols.

Result: High performance on general benchmarks doesn't guarantee success in specialized domains. DeepSeek R1 achieved SOTA (50.6%), surpassing Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), but showed significant accuracy drop from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yielded parity or higher accuracy than English.

Conclusion: Specialized domains like cricket analytics present unique challenges for LLMs. The surprising performance of Hindi queries challenges assumptions about English being optimal for specialized SQL tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarks and multilingual evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Cricket is the second most popular sport globally, commanding a massive following of over 2.5 billion fans globally. Enthusiasts and analysts frequently seek advanced statistical insights, such as long-term historical performance trends or complex player comparisons, that are often unavailable through standard web searches. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in Text-to-SQL tasks, their capability to handle the domain-specific nuances, complex schema variations, and multilingual requirements inherent to sports analytics remains under-explored. To investigate this potential capability gap, we present CricBench, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs on specialized cricket data. To curate a "Gold Standard" dataset, we collaborate with domain experts in cricket and SQL to manually author complex queries, ensuring logical correctness. Recognizing linguistic diversity, we construct the benchmark in both English and Hindi, establishing a framework that is open for further extension to other regional languages. We evaluate six state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and open-source models, using a strict evaluation protocol. Our results reveal that high performance on general benchmarks does not guarantee success in specialized domains. While the open-weights reasoning model DeepSeek R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance (50.6%), surpassing proprietary giants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (47.7%) and GPT-4o (33.7%), it still exhibits a significant accuracy drop when moving from general benchmarks (BIRD) to CricBench. Furthermore, we observe that code-mixed Hindi queries frequently yield parity or higher accuracy compared to English, challenging the assumption that English is the optimal prompt language for specialized SQL tasks.

### [107] [Explainable Statute Prediction via Attention-based Model and LLM Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21902)
*Sachin Pawar,Girish Keshav Palshikar,Anindita Sinha Banerjee,Nitin Ramrakhiyani,Basit Ali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques for automatic statute prediction with explanations: AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) using smaller supervised models and LLMPrompt using larger zero-shot LLMs, both evaluated on legal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI systems for legal applications (AI-assistants for lawyers, legal QA) that can predict relevant statutes from case descriptions and provide human-understandable explanations for better user acceptance.

Method: Two approaches: (1) AoS uses attention over sentences with sentence transformers trained supervisedly; (2) LLMPrompt uses larger LLMs with zero-shot prompting (standard and Chain-of-Thought) to predict and explain statute relevance.

Result: Both techniques produce statute predictions with explanations. Performance compared across two datasets against baselines. Explanation quality evaluated through automated counter-factual analysis and human evaluation.

Conclusion: The paper presents two complementary approaches for statute prediction with explanations - one supervised with smaller models (AoS) and one zero-shot with larger LLMs (LLMPrompt), both capable of generating human-understandable justifications for legal AI systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of automatic statute prediction where for a given case description, a subset of relevant statutes are to be predicted. Here, the term "statute" refers to a section, a sub-section, or an article of any specific Act. Addressing this problem would be useful in several applications such as AI-assistant for lawyers and legal question answering system. For better user acceptance of such Legal AI systems, we believe the predictions should also be accompanied by human understandable explanations. We propose two techniques for addressing this problem of statute prediction with explanations -- (i) AoS (Attention-over-Sentences) which uses attention over sentences in a case description to predict statutes relevant for it and (ii) LLMPrompt which prompts an LLM to predict as well as explain relevance of a certain statute. AoS uses smaller language models, specifically sentence transformers and is trained in a supervised manner whereas LLMPrompt uses larger language models in a zero-shot manner and explores both standard as well as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques. Both these models produce explanations for their predictions in human understandable forms. We compare statute prediction performance of both the proposed techniques with each other as well as with a set of competent baselines, across two popular datasets. Also, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanations through an automated counter-factual manner as well as through human evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparse verification framework for speculative decoding that reduces computational bottlenecks in verification stage by sparsifying attention, FFN, and MoE components with retrieval reuse strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification stage in speculative decoding becomes computational bottleneck for long-context inputs and MoE models, while existing sparsification methods are designed for standard token-by-token decoding.

Method: Systematically adopts sparse methods on verification stage, identifies structured redundancy, proposes joint sparsification of attention, FFN, and MoE components with inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategies.

Result: Achieves favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across summarization, QA, and mathematical reasoning datasets while maintaining stable acceptance length.

Conclusion: Proposed sparse verification framework effectively reduces dominant computation cost in speculative decoding verification stage without additional training.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive language model inference by verifying multiple draft tokens in parallel. However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.

### [109] [SWE-RM: Execution-free Feedback For Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21919)
*KaShun Shum,Binyuan Hui,Jiawei Chen,Lei Zhang,X. W.,Jiaxi Yang,Yuzhen Huang,Junyang Lin,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-RM, a robust reward model for software engineering agents that addresses limitations of execution-based feedback by focusing on classification accuracy and calibration for better RL performance alongside TTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Execution-based feedback (unit testing) has limitations: it requires scalable test collection, provides sparse feedback, and can't distinguish between equally successful/unsuccessful trajectories. Execution-free feedback from reward models offers finer-grained signals but remains underexplored for SWE agents. The authors found that verifiers with similar TTS performance can yield very different RL results, indicating TTS doesn't generalize well to RL.

Method: Identified two crucial aspects for RL training beyond TTS: classification accuracy and calibration. Conducted comprehensive controlled experiments on factors like training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Developed SWE-RM using a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters (3B activated during inference) based on experimental insights.

Result: SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. It increased Qwen3-Coder-Flash accuracy from 51.6% to 62.0% and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that execution-free reward models can effectively improve SWE agents when designed with proper attention to RL-specific requirements like classification accuracy and calibration. SWE-RM's mixture-of-experts architecture successfully addresses the limitations of execution-based feedback while maintaining strong TTS performance.

Abstract: Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.

### [110] [Broken Words, Broken Performance: Effect of Tokenization on Performance of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21933)
*Sachin Pawar,Manoj Apte,Kshitij Jadhav,Girish Keshav Palshikar,Nitin Ramrakhiyani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how LLM tokenization that breaks natural words into multiple tokens negatively impacts NLP task performance, proposing penalty functions to quantify this effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM tokenization differs from traditional NLP tokenization by sometimes splitting natural words into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size, which may negatively affect model performance on NLP tasks.

Method: Proposes a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for given text and specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is, then tests this hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks across different LLMs.

Result: Establishes statistical significance of the hypothesis that breaking natural words into multiple tokens negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks.

Conclusion: LLM tokenization that breaks natural words has measurable negative effects on NLP task performance, and the proposed penalty functions can quantify this impact.

Abstract: Tokenization is the first step in training any Large Language Model (LLM), where the text is split into a sequence of tokens as per the model's fixed vocabulary. This tokenization in LLMs is different from the traditional tokenization in NLP where the text is split into a sequence of "natural" words. In LLMs, a natural word may also be broken into multiple tokens due to limited vocabulary size of the LLMs (e.g., Mistral's tokenizer splits "martial" into "mart" and "ial"). In this paper, we hypothesize that such breaking of natural words negatively impacts LLM performance on various NLP tasks. To quantify this effect, we propose a set of penalty functions that compute a tokenization penalty for a given text for a specific LLM, indicating how "bad" the tokenization is. We establish statistical significance of our hypothesis on multiple NLP tasks for a set of different LLMs.

*Tal Halevi,Yarden Tzach,Ronit D. Gross,Shalom Rosner,Ido Kanter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to quantify information processing in self-attention mechanisms, analyzing BERT-12 to reveal how attention heads specialize in different linguistic features and how similarity patterns evolve across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While self-attention has advanced NLP significantly, the precise mechanisms underlying its learning process and quantitative characterization remain poorly understood, creating a need for new approaches to measure information processing within attention mechanisms.

Method: The study introduces a novel approach for quantifying self-attention information processing, analyzing BERT-12 architecture by deriving context similarity matrices from attention head vector spaces and examining attention map patterns across layers.

Result: Analysis reveals that final layers focus on sentence separator tokens for text segmentation, different heads specialize in distinct linguistic features (token repetition, common tokens), similarity patterns evolve from long-range to short-range across layers, and each head focuses on unique tokens to build similarity pairs.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative insights into self-attention mechanisms, demonstrating specialized linguistic processing across attention heads and evolving similarity patterns that culminate in sentence-level processing, offering practical approaches for text segmentation and understanding attention-based learning.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, facilitating the development of advanced language-learning machines. Although its utility is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms of self-attention underlying its advanced learning and the quantitative characterization of this learning process remains an open research question. This study introduces a new approach for quantifying information processing within the self-attention mechanism. The analysis conducted on the BERT-12 architecture reveals that, in the final layers, the attention map focuses on sentence separator tokens, suggesting a practical approach to text segmentation based on semantic features. Based on the vector space emerging from the self-attention heads, a context similarity matrix, measuring the scalar product between two token vectors was derived, revealing distinct similarities between different token vector pairs within each head and layer. The findings demonstrated that different attention heads within an attention block focused on different linguistic characteristics, such as identifying token repetitions in a given text or recognizing a token of common appearance in the text and its surrounding context. This specialization is also reflected in the distribution of distances between token vectors with high similarity as the architecture progresses. The initial attention layers exhibit substantially long-range similarities; however, as the layers progress, a more short-range similarity develops, culminating in a preference for attention heads to create strong similarities within the same sentence. Finally, the behavior of individual heads was analyzed by examining the uniqueness of their most common tokens in their high similarity elements. Each head tends to focus on a unique token from the text and builds similarity pairs centered around it.

TL;DR: CAT introduces a proactive context management paradigm for LLM-based software engineering agents, enabling them to actively compress historical interactions into structured summaries to maintain bounded context while preserving reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based SWE agents suffer from context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-horizon interactions due to append-only context maintenance or passive compression heuristics.

Method: Proposes CAT: a callable context management tool with structured workspace (stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, high-fidelity short-term interactions). Introduces CAT-GENERATOR framework for trajectory-level supervision and trains SWE-Compressor model using offline data construction pipeline.

Result: SWE-Compressor achieves 57.6% solved rate on SWE-Bench-Verified, significantly outperforming ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines while maintaining stable reasoning under bounded context budget.

Conclusion: Proactive context management through CAT enables scalable long-horizon reasoning for SWE agents by transforming context maintenance from passive overhead to an integrated decision-making tool.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models have recently shown strong potential on real-world software engineering (SWE) tasks that require long-horizon interaction with repository-scale codebases. However, most existing agents rely on append-only context maintenance or passively triggered compression heuristics, which often lead to context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning in long-running interactions. We propose CAT, a new context management paradigm that elevates context maintenance to a callable tool integrated into the decision-making process of agents. CAT formalizes a structured context workspace consisting of stable task semantics, condensed long-term memory, and high-fidelity short-term interactions, and enables agents to proactively compress historical trajectories into actionable summaries at appropriate milestones. To support context management for SWE-agents, we propose a trajectory-level supervision framework, CAT-GENERATOR, based on an offline data construction pipeline that injects context-management actions into complete interaction trajectories. Using this framework, we train a context-aware model, SWE-Compressor. Experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that SWE-Compressor reaches a 57.6% solved rate and significantly outperforms ReAct-based agents and static compression baselines, while maintaining stable and scalable long-horizon reasoning under a bounded context budget.

TL;DR: TrGLUE is a comprehensive Turkish natural language understanding benchmark that addresses the lack of GLUE-style evaluation for Turkish, featuring native corpora and a semi-automated annotation pipeline with human validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GLUE benchmarks exist for English and other languages (Chinese, French, Japanese), there is no comparable comprehensive NLU benchmark for Turkish, creating a gap in evaluating Turkish language models and NLP systems.

Method: Created Turkish-native corpora mirroring GLUE domains and tasks, using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and human validation to ensure quality and minimize translation artifacts.

Result: Introduces TrGLUE as a comprehensive Turkish NLU benchmark and SentiTurca for sentiment analysis, providing fine-tuning/evaluation code for transformer models and establishing a scalable, reproducible workflow for dataset creation.

Conclusion: TrGLUE establishes a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, provides valuable resources for researchers, and offers insights into creating high-quality semi-automated datasets for languages lacking comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.

TL;DR: MLLM-based multi-agent system achieves expert-level performance in interpreting HTP drawings, offering standardized projective assessment with high semantic similarity to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional HTP test: heterogeneous scoring standards, subjective examiner reliance, and lack of unified quantitative coding system.

Method: Multi-agent framework using multimodal large language models to integrate social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, decoupling feature recognition from psychological inference.

Result: Mean semantic similarity of 0.75 between MLLM and human expert interpretations (0.85 for structural data), with effective hallucination correction and high ecological validity reports.

Conclusion: MLLMs show potential as standardized projective assessment tools; multi-agent framework offers new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

Abstract: Background: The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, introduced by John Buck in 1948, remains a widely used projective technique in clinical psychology. However, it has long faced challenges such as heterogeneous scoring standards, reliance on examiners subjective experience, and a lack of a unified quantitative coding system.
  Results: Quantitative experiments showed that the mean semantic similarity between Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) interpretations and human expert interpretations was approximately 0.75 (standard deviation about 0.05). In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.
  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment. The proposed multi-agent framework, by dividing roles, decouples feature recognition from psychological inference and offers a new paradigm for digital mental-health services.

TL;DR: Analysis of Go Life-and-Death problem solving using Relevance-Zone Based Search reveals solver behavior patterns, rare pattern discovery, and differences from human solutions in two cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and relevance-zone pattern table techniques solve Life-and-Death problems, comparing their solutions with expert human solutions from Cho Chikun's "Life and Death Dictionary."

Method: Used relevance-zone based solvers to analyze seven Life-and-Death problems from Cho Chikun's book, examining the relevance-zones identified, patterns discovered, and comparing solver solutions with given human solutions.

Result: 1. Solvers identified critical relevance-zones for each problem. 2. Discovered series of patterns including rare ones. 3. Found different answers compared to given solutions for two problems. 4. Identified issues: misjudging values of rare patterns and prioritizing living directly over maximizing territory (unlike human players).

Conclusion: The study reveals both capabilities and limitations of current Go solvers, suggesting future work to address identified issues with rare pattern valuation and territory optimization strategies.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

### [116] [Three-way conflict analysis based on alliance and conflict functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21419)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang,Xin Yang,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes separating alliance and conflict functions to clarify semantics in three-way conflict analysis, addressing issues with standard aggregation methods that obscure meaningful differences in agent attitudes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current three-way conflict analysis uses single functions that combine opposite aspects (alliance/conflict), making aggregations ambiguous - for example, averaging +1 and -1 gives the same result as two neutral relations, despite representing very different attitudes.

Method: Separate alliance and conflict functions instead of using a single auxiliary function, then apply this approach to trisect agents, issues, and agent pairs, exploring alliance sets and strategies.

Result: The proposed separation clarifies semantics in conflict analysis, enabling more meaningful interpretations of agent relations and attitudes, with practical applications demonstrated through real-world examples.

Conclusion: Separating alliance and conflict functions provides clearer semantic interpretation in three-way conflict analysis, addressing limitations of standard aggregation methods and enabling better analysis of agent relations and strategies.

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

*Jing Liu,Mengjun Hu,Guangming Lang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new approach for three-way conflict resolution that identifies feasible strategies using weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, outperforming existing methods in finding optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing three-way conflict analysis focuses on understanding conflicts but lacks practical resolution methods. The formulation of feasible strategies for conflict resolution has received insufficient attention, creating a gap between conflict analysis and actual resolution.

Method: The method computes overall ratings for agent cliques using positive/negative similarity degrees, then proposes weighted consistency and non-consistency measures considering both agent and issue weights. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, L-order feasible strategies, and optimal solutions.

Result: The models were applied to NBA labor negotiations and Gansu Province development plans. Sensitivity and comparative analyses show the approach outperforms conventional methods by systematically identifying feasible strategies and optimal solutions through unified weighted agent-issue evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed conflict resolution models effectively bridge the gap between conflict analysis and resolution by providing systematic methods to identify feasible and optimal strategies using weighted consistency/non-consistency measures, demonstrating practical superiority over existing approaches.

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

### [118] [Three-way decision with incomplete information based on similarity and satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21421)
*Junfang Luo,Mengjun Hu,Keyun Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper generalizes three-way decision theory from complete to incomplete information by extending both computational (equivalence relations) and conceptual (logic satisfiability) formulations with new similarity and satisfiability degree measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Three-way decision theory is well-established for complete information, but real-world applications often involve incomplete information. The paper aims to bridge this gap by generalizing existing formulations to handle incomplete data.

Method: For computational formulation: proposes similarity degree measure (generalizing equivalence relations) and two approaches using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects. For conceptual formulation: proposes satisfiability degree measure (quantitative generalization of satisfiability) and two approaches using alpha-meaning sets and confidence of formulas.

Result: Develops a comprehensive framework for three-way decision with incomplete information, introducing novel concepts like approximability and new approaches in conceptual formulation that point to promising research directions beyond traditional similarity class methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes three-way decision theory to incomplete information, providing both computational and conceptual formulations with new measures and approaches that expand the applicability of rough set theory to more practical real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Three-way decision is widely applied with rough set theory to learn classification or decision rules. The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively. While using similarity classes is a common method of analyzing incomplete information in the literature, the proposed concept of approximability and the two approaches in conceptual formulation point out new promising directions.

*Fanwei Zeng,Changtao Miao,Jing Huang,Zhiya Tan,Shutao Gong,Xiaoming Yu,Yang Wang,Huazhe Tan,Weibin Yao,Jianshu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LogicLens is a unified visual-textual co-reasoning framework for text-centric forgery analysis that integrates detection, grounding, and explanation through cross-cues-aware reasoning and multi-task optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-centric forgery analysis methods are limited to coarse-grained visual analysis, lack sophisticated reasoning, and treat detection, grounding, and explanation as separate tasks, missing opportunities for holistic performance enhancement through their intrinsic relationships.

Method: LogicLens uses Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism for iterative visual-textual cross-validation, weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization, and PR² pipeline (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) for generating high-quality annotations on the RealText dataset (5,397 images).

Result: LogicLens achieves 41.4% improvement over specialized frameworks and 23.4% over GPT-4o on T-IC13 in zero-shot evaluation, and establishes significant leads on T-SROIE dataset over other MLLM-based methods across multiple metrics including mF1, CSS, and macro-average F1.

Conclusion: LogicLens demonstrates superior performance in unified text-centric forgery analysis through visual-textual co-reasoning, showing the effectiveness of integrating detection, grounding, and explanation tasks with sophisticated reasoning mechanisms.

Abstract: Sophisticated text-centric forgeries, fueled by rapid AIGC advancements, pose a significant threat to societal security and information authenticity. Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1. Our dataset, model, and code will be made publicly available.

*Yanhao Li,Lu Ma,Jiaran Zhang,Lexiang Tang,Wentao Zhang,Guibo Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Leash is a reinforcement learning framework that uses adaptive length penalties to make LLMs produce more concise reasoning while maintaining performance, reducing reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fixed length penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to LLMs' evolving reasoning abilities, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness.

Method: Formulates length control as constrained optimization, employs Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust penalty coefficient - intensifying when generations exceed target length, relaxing when shorter.

Result: Reduces average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks (mathematical reasoning, coding, instruction following) while maintaining competitive performance on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507.

Conclusion: Presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on fixed length penalties, but such penalties are hard to tune and fail to adapt to the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and conciseness. To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance. Our work thus presents a practical and effective paradigm for developing controllable and efficient LLMs that balance reasoning capabilities with computational budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models in medicine often produce hallucinations or inconsistent reasoning, limiting clinical trust despite the growth of LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Built on LLaVA, the framework includes: input encoder for text/images, projection module for cross-modal alignment, reasoning controller for task decomposition, and logic tree generator for assembling verifiable conclusions.

Result: Improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks while remaining competitive on text-only settings, as shown on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach represents a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI by addressing reliability and interpretability issues in clinical reasoning.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine, simply integrating clinical text and medical imaging does not guarantee reliable reasoning. Existing multimodal models often produce hallucinations or inconsistent chains of thought, limiting clinical trust. We propose a diagnostic framework built upon LLaVA that combines vision-language alignment with logic-regularized reasoning. The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions. Evaluations on MedXpertQA and other benchmarks show that our method improves diagnostic accuracy and yields more interpretable reasoning traces on multimodal tasks, while remaining competitive on text-only settings. These results suggest a promising step toward trustworthy multimodal medical AI.

TL;DR: OrchestRA is an autonomous multi-agent AI platform that integrates biology, chemistry, and pharmacology to transform drug discovery from stochastic search to programmable engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic discovery faces challenges from domain fragmentation and the gap between computational design and physiological validation. Current generative AI models are passive assistants rather than autonomous executors.

Method: Human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform with three specialized agents: Biologist Agent uses knowledge graph (>10M associations) to identify targets; Chemist Agent performs de novo design or drug repositioning; Pharmacologist Agent runs PBPK simulations. Governed by an Orchestrator that creates dynamic feedback loops.

Result: The platform establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization, enabling iterative optimization.

Conclusion: OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design by integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, transforming drug discovery into a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

Abstract: Therapeutic discovery remains a formidable challenge, impeded by the fragmentation of specialized domains and the execution gap between computational design and physiological validation. Although generative AI offers promise, current models often function as passive assistants rather than as autonomous executors. Here, we introduce OrchestRA, a human-in-the-loop multi-agent platform that unifies biology, chemistry, and pharmacology into an autonomous discovery engine. Unlike static code generators, our agents actively execute simulations and reason the results to drive iterative optimization. Governed by an Orchestrator, a Biologist Agent leverages deep reasoning over a massive knowledge graph (>10 million associations) to pinpoint high-confidence targets; a Chemist Agent autonomously detects structural pockets for de novo design or drug repositioning; and a Pharmacologist Agent evaluates candidates via rigorous physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations. This architecture establishes a dynamic feedback loop where pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles directly trigger structural reoptimization. By seamlessly integrating autonomous execution with human guidance, OrchestRA democratizes therapeutic design, transforming drug discovery from a stochastic search to a programmable evidence-based engineering discipline.

### [124] [Multiple-play Stochastic Bandits with Prioritized Arm Capacity Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21626)
*Hong Xie,Haoran Gu,Yanying Huang,Tao Tan,Defu Lian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multiple-play stochastic bandit variant for resource allocation in LLM/edge intelligence applications, featuring prioritized capacity sharing with priority weights, and provides matching regret bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource allocation problems in emerging applications like LLM serving and edge intelligence require models that account for prioritized resource sharing, where different requests have different priority weights and compete for limited stochastic capacities.

Method: Proposes a multiple-play stochastic bandit model with M arms and K plays, where each arm has stochastic capacity and each capacity unit has reward. Priority weights determine allocation order. Designs MSB-PRS-OffOpt algorithm for optimal policy computation (O(MK³)), then uses it in an approximate UCB algorithm for learning.

Result: Proves instance-independent regret lower bound Ω(α₁σ√(KMT)) and instance-dependent lower bound Ω(α₁σ²(M/Δ)lnT). Achieves matching upper bounds up to factors √(KlnKT) and α₁K² respectively. MSB-PRS-OffOpt finds optimal allocation with O(MK³) complexity.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses technical challenges of optimizing/learning under nonlinear combinatorial utility from prioritized resource sharing, providing near-optimal algorithms with theoretical guarantees for practical resource allocation problems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a Responsible and Explainable AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows using multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance to address challenges in explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI systems enable powerful autonomous capabilities but introduce critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing implementations emphasize functionality and scalability but provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions.

Method: Proposes a Responsible and Explainable AI Agent Architecture based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. A consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from shared input context, exposing uncertainty and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent performs structured consolidation across outputs, enforcing safety/policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations/bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions.

Result: The architecture was evaluated across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains.

Conclusion: The work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction through explicit cross-model comparison, preserved intermediate outputs, centralized reasoning-layer control, and agent-level constraints.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks through the coordination of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language Models (VLMs), tools, and external services. While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains. This work provides practical guidance for designing agentic AI systems that are autonomous and scalable, yet responsible and explainable by construction.

TL;DR: CRS framework evaluates dataset compliance with transparency, accountability, and security principles, with an open-source library for integration into AI pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAI datasets are often built using opaque data collection practices, with ethical/legal considerations neglected and provenance information lost during sharing/editing.

Method: Introduces Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS) framework and open-source Python library using data provenance technology for evaluating dataset compliance.

Result: Framework and library enable both reactive evaluation of existing datasets and proactive guidance for responsible scraping/construction of new datasets.

Conclusion: CRS addresses the gap in ethical/legal considerations for GAI datasets by providing tools for compliance assessment and responsible dataset creation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has experienced exponential growth in recent years, partly facilitated by the abundance of large-scale open-source datasets. These datasets are often built using unrestricted and opaque data collection practices. While most literature focuses on the development and applications of GAI models, the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the creation of these datasets are often neglected. In addition, as datasets are shared, edited, and further reproduced online, information about their origin, legitimacy, and safety often gets lost. To address this gap, we introduce the Compliance Rating Scheme (CRS), a framework designed to evaluate dataset compliance with critical transparency, accountability, and security principles. We also release an open-source Python library built around data provenance technology to implement this framework, allowing for seamless integration into existing dataset-processing and AI training pipelines. The library is simultaneously reactive and proactive, as in addition to evaluating the CRS of existing datasets, it equally informs responsible scraping and construction of new datasets.

TL;DR: SAGA introduces a bi-level autonomous agent system that automatically designs and evolves objective functions for scientific discovery, moving beyond fixed proxy objectives to improve discovery effectiveness across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific discovery agents rely on imperfect proxy objective functions specified by scientists. For grand scientific challenges, these fixed objectives limit discovery potential. The paper argues that automating objective function design is a central, unmet requirement for effective scientific discovery agents.

Method: SAGA employs a bi-level architecture: an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under current objectives. This enables systematic exploration of objective space and trade-offs rather than treating objectives as fixed inputs.

Result: The framework is demonstrated across multiple applications including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design. Results show that automating objective formulation substantially improves the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Conclusion: Automating objective function design is crucial for advancing scientific discovery agents. SAGA's bi-level architecture successfully addresses this challenge by enabling dynamic evolution of objectives, leading to improved discovery outcomes across diverse scientific domains.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Motivation: Spatial transcriptomics assays are increasing in scale and complexity, creating computational bottlenecks, and it's unclear whether frontier AI agents can extract biological insights from messy, real-world spatial datasets.

Method: Created SpatialBench with 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories, each with experimental data snapshots and deterministic graders to evaluate recovery of key biological results.

Result: Base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families) with strong model-task and model-platform interactions; harness design has large empirical effect on performance, indicating tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment need evaluation as first-class objects.

Conclusion: SpatialBench serves as both a measurement tool and diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.

*Zubair Shah,Noaman Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pruning as equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components, where sparsity emerges naturally when participation becomes dominated strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most pruning methods treat sparsity as externally imposed constraint using heuristic scores or regularization. This work proposes a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components.

Method: Model parameter groups (weights, neurons, filters) as players in continuous non-cooperative game. Each player selects participation level to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Sparsity emerges when participation becomes dominated strategy at equilibrium. Derive equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without explicit importance scores.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs. Approach offers interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: Pruning can be formulated as equilibrium phenomenon where sparsity emerges naturally from strategic interactions among model components, providing principled explanation for pruning behavior without relying on heuristic importance scores.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using resistance distance instead of graph-theoretic shortest distance for stress-based graph drawing, introducing Omega algorithm with linear-time complexity and improved structural preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional stress-based graph drawing methods that use graph-theoretic shortest distance, which fails to capture global graph structure and has computational/theoretical issues.

Method: Introduces resistance distance derived from graph Laplacian spectrum, which admits natural isometric Euclidean embedding. Develops Omega algorithm with fast resistance distance embedding and random node-pair sampling for SGD, enabling comprehensive sampling strategy.

Result: Experiments show improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. Omega achieves lower and more stable stress values than pivot-based methods, with O(|E|) complexity for both weighted/unweighted graphs.

Conclusion: Establishes connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing practical and scalable solution for network visualization using resistance distance paradigm.

Abstract: This paper challenges the convention of using graph-theoretic shortest distance in stress-based graph drawing. We propose a new paradigm based on resistance distance, derived from the graph Laplacian's spectrum, which better captures global graph structure. This approach overcomes theoretical and computational limitations of traditional methods, as resistance distance admits a natural isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Our experiments demonstrate improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. We introduce Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that integrates a fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This comprehensive random sampling strategy, enabled by efficient pre-computation of resistance distance embeddings, is more effective and robust than pivot-based sampling used in prior algorithms, consistently achieving lower and more stable stress values. The algorithm maintains $O(|E|)$ complexity for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our work establishes a connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing a practical and scalable solution for network visualization.
