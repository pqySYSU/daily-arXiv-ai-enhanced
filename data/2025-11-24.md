### [1] [Parameter-Free Neural Lens Blur Rendering for High-Fidelity Composites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17014)
*Lingyan Ruan,Bin Chen,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for realistic lens blur compositing in mixed reality that estimates circle of confusion (CoC) maps directly from RGB images without requiring camera parameters or scene depth, enabling high-fidelity blending of virtual objects into real scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens blur compositing methods require camera parameters and scene depth information, which are often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting accessibility and generalizability of realistic mixed reality compositions.

Method: Proposes estimating CoC maps directly from RGB images, inferring CoC values for virtual objects through linear relationship between signed CoC maps and depth, and rendering realistic lens blur using a neural reblurring network.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible and practical solution for real-world mixed reality applications by eliminating the need for camera metadata or depth information while maintaining realistic lens blur effects.

Abstract: Consistent and natural camera lens blur is important for seamlessly blending 3D virtual objects into photographed real-scenes. Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, addressing limitations of optimization-based and multi-view 2D editing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome critical limitations in existing 3D editing methods: optimization-based approaches are too slow, while feed-forward methods using multi-view 2D editing suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality.

Method: Created a large-scale multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing covering addition, deletion, and modification tasks. Explored two conditioning strategies: conventional cross-attention and a novel 3D token concatenation approach.

Result: Token concatenation proved more parameter-efficient and achieved superior performance. The method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed native 3D editing framework sets a new benchmark for instruction-guided 3D editing by directly manipulating 3D representations efficiently while maintaining high quality and consistency.

Abstract: Instruction-guided 3D editing is a rapidly emerging field with the potential to broaden access to 3D content creation. However, existing methods face critical limitations: optimization-based approaches are prohibitively slow, while feed-forward approaches relying on multi-view 2D editing often suffer from inconsistent geometry and degraded visual quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel native 3D editing framework that directly manipulates 3D representations in a single, efficient feed-forward pass. Specifically, we create a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for instruction-guided 3D editing, covering diverse addition, deletion, and modification tasks. This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.

### [3] [The persistence of painting styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16695)
*Reetikaa Reddy Munnangi,Barbara Giunti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Persistent homology from topological data analysis can objectively differentiate artistic styles between artists and distinguish human-created art from AI-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional art style identification relies on subjective expert intuition, but mathematical tools can provide more objective and structured analysis of artistic styles.

Method: Using persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method, to analyze artistic styles through mathematical structure and statistical analysis.

Result: PH can statistically differentiate between artists from different artistic movements and within the same movement, and can distinguish human artist images from AI-generated images in the artist's style.

Conclusion: Persistent homology provides objective, interpretable insights into artistic styles that complement traditional art analysis methods.

Abstract: Art is a deeply personal and expressive medium, where each artist brings their own style, technique, and cultural background into their work. Traditionally, identifying artistic styles has been the job of art historians or critics, relying on visual intuition and experience. However, with the advancement of mathematical tools, we can explore art through more structured lens. In this work, we show how persistent homology (PH), a method from topological data analysis, provides objective and interpretable insights on artistic styles. We show how PH can, with statistical certainty, differentiate between artists, both from different artistic currents and from the same one, and distinguish images of an artist from an AI-generated image in the artist's style.

*Takuya Igaue,Catia Correia-Caeiro,Akito Yoshida,Takako Miyabe-Nishiwaki,Ryusuke Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using StyleGAN2 to generate diverse macaque monkey facial expressions by addressing data limitations through data augmentation, sample selection, and loss refinement, outperforming models trained only on original images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating animal faces is challenging due to limited training data, especially for facial expressions across individuals. Macaque monkeys are important for neuroscience and evolutionary research.

Method: Used StyleGAN2 with three key improvements: 1) data augmentation via motion transfer to animate still images, 2) sample selection based on latent representations for uniform training data, 3) loss function refinement for accurate eye movement reproduction.

Result: The method successfully generated diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. The model also enabled effective style-based image editing with specific parameters corresponding to distinct facial movements.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses data limitations in animal face generation and shows potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for macaque facial expression research.

Abstract: Generating animal faces using generative AI techniques is challenging because the available training images are limited both in quantity and variation, particularly for facial expressions across individuals. In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images. Additionally, we show that our model is effective for style-based image editing, where specific style parameters correspond to distinct facial movements. These findings underscore the model's potential for disentangling motion components as style parameters, providing a valuable tool for research on macaque facial expressions.

### [6] [A Machine Learning-Driven Solution for Denoising Inertial Confinement Fusion Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16717)
*Asya Y. Akkus,Bradley T. Wolfe,Pinghan Chu,Chengkun Huang,Chris S. Campbell,Mariana Alvarado Alvarez,Petr Volegov,David Fittinghoff,Robert Reinovsky,Zhehui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents an unsupervised autoencoder with CDF 97 wavelet transform for denoising neutron images affected by mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods like BM3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutron imaging is crucial for analyzing ICF events but images are degraded by mixed Gaussian-Poisson noise that conventional methods struggle to remove while preserving image fidelity. Recent advances in synthetic data enable machine learning approaches.

Method: Implemented an unsupervised autoencoder with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising of neutron imaging data.

Result: The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data with lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics compared to non-ML-based filtering methods like BM3D.

Conclusion: This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

Abstract: Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) by creating a unified model that can handle various concept prompts and provide segmentation masks with unique identities for object instances across both images and videos.

Method: Built a scalable data engine producing 4M unique concept labels dataset with hard negatives. Model consists of image-level detector and memory-based video tracker sharing a single backbone, with decoupled recognition and localization using a presence head to boost detection accuracy.

Conclusion: SAM 3 represents a significant advancement in promptable concept segmentation, with open-sourced model and new SA-Co benchmark to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: We present Segment Anything Model (SAM) 3, a unified model that detects, segments, and tracks objects in images and videos based on concept prompts, which we define as either short noun phrases (e.g., "yellow school bus"), image exemplars, or a combination of both. Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.

*Adeel Yousaf,Joseph Fioresi,James Beetham,Amrit Singh Bedi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaFeR-CLIP is a fine-tuning framework that improves vision-language model safety by redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives, minimizing representational disruption and recovering up to 8.0% zero-shot accuracy while maintaining robust safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety fine-tuning methods for vision-language models like CLIP cause significant drops in generalization performance due to rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts to single predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure.

Method: Proposed proximity-aware approach that redirects unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. Introduced SaFeR-CLIP framework applying this principle of minimal intervention.

Result: SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. Also contributed NSFW-Caps benchmark with 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

Conclusion: Respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance in vision-language models.

Abstract: Improving the safety of vision-language models like CLIP via fine-tuning often comes at a steep price, causing significant drops in their generalization performance. We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.

### [9] [SVG360: Multi-View SVG Generation with Geometric and Color Consistency from a Single SVG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16766)
*Mengnan Jiang,Zhaolin Sun,Christian Franke,Michele Franco Adesso,Antonio Haas,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage framework for generating multi-view consistent SVGs from single-view input using 3D lifting, spatial memory mechanisms, and path optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGs are crucial for modern design but generating multi-view consistent SVGs from single-view input remains underexplored, limiting applications in asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Lift rasterized input to 3D and render multi-view images, 2) Extend SAM2's temporal memory to spatial domain for part-level correspondences, 3) Path consolidation and structural optimization during raster-to-vector conversion.

Result: Generated SVGs show strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduced redundant paths, and preserved fine structural details.

Conclusion: This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing scalable multi-view SVG generation from single input for applications like asset creation and semantic vector editing.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are central to modern design workflows, offering scaling without distortion and precise editability. However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details. This work bridges generative modeling and structured vector representation, providing a scalable route to single input, object level multi-view SVG generation and supporting applications such as asset creation and semantic vector editing.

### [10] [Mesh RAG: Retrieval Augmentation for Autoregressive Mesh Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16807)
*Xiatao Sun,Chen Liang,Qian Wang,Daniel Rakita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh RAG is a training-free framework that enhances autoregressive mesh generation by using retrieval-based component generation, improving quality, speed, and enabling incremental editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mesh creation is manual and time-intensive. Autoregressive models automate this but face quality-speed trade-offs and sequential dependencies that complicate editing.

Method: Leverages point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components in a parallelizable way, inspired by RAG for language models.

Result: Significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential prediction, and enables incremental editing across various autoregressive models without retraining.

Conclusion: Mesh RAG effectively overcomes sequential limitations in autoregressive mesh generation, providing quality improvements, faster inference, and editing capabilities in a plug-and-play framework.

Abstract: 3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.

Motivation: To address the gap in existing EO datasets that mainly focus on semantic understanding tasks, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables.

Method: Created a dataset integrating co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated through a hybrid human-AI pipeline, establishing a cognitive logic chain in forest ecology.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation reveals current vision language models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting a key challenge for scientific VLMs in Earth Observation.

Conclusion: REO-Instruct provides a standardized foundation for developing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference, bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision language models (VLMs) has enabled remarkable perception and reasoning capabilities, yet their potential for scientific regression in Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOP-ASK is a large-scale dataset for object interaction reasoning that addresses limitations in current spatial reasoning benchmarks by providing fine-grained annotations including grasp poses, object poses, path planning trajectories, and various spatial relationships across 150k images and 33M QA pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform well on high-level spatial relationships but lack fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real-world applications like precise 3D localization, physical compatibility, object affordances, and multi-step spatial planning.

Method: Leveraged 6D object poses from BOP datasets to create fine-grained annotations including grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships across six tasks (four novel).

Result: Models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities in precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments.

Conclusion: BOP-ASK provides a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating VLMs on fine-grained object interaction reasoning, addressing critical gaps in current spatial reasoning benchmarks and enabling better performance on real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, yet these evaluations mask critical weaknesses in understanding object interactions. Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark. We also release BOP-ASK-lab, an out-of-distribution benchmark with images not sourced from BOP, enabling testing of generalization. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on BOP-ASK outperform baselines and exhibit emergent capabilities such as precise object and grasp pose estimation, trajectory planning, and fine-grained object-centric spatial reasoning in cluttered environments. We will publicly release our datasets and dataset generation pipeline.

### [14] [Parts-Mamba: Augmenting Joint Context with Part-Level Scanning for Occluded Human Skeleton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16860)
*Tianyi Shen,Huijuan Xu,Nilesh Ahuja,Omesh Tickoo,Philip Shin,Vijaykrishnan Narayanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Parts-Mamba is a hybrid GCN-Mamba model that addresses skeleton action recognition challenges under occlusion by capturing part-specific information and preserving non-neighboring joint context, achieving up to 12.9% accuracy improvement on NTU datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world skeleton data often contains missing parts due to occlusions or poor communication, causing existing GCN models to perform poorly because they lose local context when joints are missing.

Method: Proposed Parts-Mamba model combines GCN with Mamba architecture, featuring parts-specific scanning and a parts-body fusion module to capture part-specific information and preserve context from distant joints.

Result: The model achieves up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy on NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under various occlusion settings compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The hybrid GCN-Mamba approach effectively handles imperfect skeleton data by maintaining contextual information from non-neighboring joints, significantly improving performance in occlusion scenarios.

Abstract: Skeleton action recognition involves recognizing human action from human skeletons. The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints. The proposed Parts-Mamba model effectively captures part-specific information through its parts-specific scanning feature and preserves non-neighboring joint context via a parts-body fusion module. Our proposed model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets under different occlusion settings, achieving up to 12.9% improvement in accuracy.

Result: Benchmarking shows superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other GW variants for partial matching, with successful applications demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes.

Conclusion: JGW provides an effective solution for complex multiple object matching problems across diverse domains like computer graphics and structural biology, with promising applications for solving complex matching challenges.

Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance serves as a powerful tool for matching objects in metric spaces. However, its traditional formulation is constrained to pairwise matching between single objects, limiting its utility in scenarios and applications requiring multiple-to-one or multiple-to-multiple object matching. In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.

*Loukas Sfountouris,Giannis Daras,Paris Giampouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REPA (representation alignment) method improves inverse problem solving by aligning diffusion/flow model representations with pretrained self-supervised encoders like DINOv2, enhancing reconstruction quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend representation alignment from generative modeling to inverse problems, leveraging pretrained generative models as priors to improve reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism when ground-truth signals are unavailable.

Method: Apply representation alignment between diffusion/flow-based models and pretrained self-supervised visual encoders (e.g., DINOv2) to guide reconstruction at inference time, using approximate target features for alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring show consistent improvement in reconstruction quality across tasks and substantial efficiency gains by reducing required discretization steps.

Conclusion: REPA provides an effective inductive bias for inverse problems, enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency while offering theoretical insights into how representation alignment improves perceptual quality.

Abstract: Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NFGlassNet is a novel glass surface detection method that uses flash/no-flash image pairs to exploit reflection dynamics, outperforming existing methods that rely on boundary or reflection cues alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing glass detection methods fail to fully exploit intrinsic glass properties and rely on boundary or reflection cues, which are insufficient for accurate localization. The paper leverages the observation that illumination differences across glass surfaces create distinct reflection patterns in flash/no-flash imagery.

Method: Proposes NFGlassNet with Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) to extract reflections and Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) to fuse reflection and glass surface features. Uses a dataset of 3.3K flash/no-flash image pairs from various scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art glass surface detection methods.

Conclusion: Leveraging reflection dynamics in flash/no-flash imagery provides an effective approach for glass surface detection, with the proposed method showing superior performance compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Glass surfaces are ubiquitous in daily life, typically appearing colorless, transparent, and lacking distinctive features. These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our code, model, and dataset will be available upon acceptance of the manuscript.

TL;DR: The paper introduces R-AVST, a novel dataset for audio-visual reasoning with fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations, and proposes AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning model that directly optimizes behavior through multi-dimensional rewards without intermediate supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models focus on simple video scenarios and fail to capture the complexity of real-world audio-visual events, creating a gap in understanding complex spatio-temporal reasoning in videos.

Method: Created R-AVST dataset using a pipeline with LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation, and manual quality inspection. Proposed AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning model that avoids intermediate supervision and uses multi-dimensional rewards to directly optimize behavior.

Result: Generated over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 audio-visual event types, and created 8K+ high-quality question-answer pairs. AVST-Zero demonstrated competitive performance compared to existing models in audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero provides a novel approach for addressing future challenges in this domain, with extensive experiments validating their effectiveness.

Abstract: Recently, rapid advancements have been made in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in video understanding tasks. However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.

*Hao-Chien Hsueh,Chi-En Yen,Wen-Hsiao Peng,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Warm Diffusion bridges hot diffusion (noise-based) and cold diffusion (blur-based) paradigms by proposing a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model that jointly controls blurring and noise, exploiting spectral dependencies in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hot diffusion fails to leverage correlations between high-frequency details and low-frequency structures, while cold diffusion neglects the role of noise in shaping the data manifold, causing out-of-manifold issues. The goal is to integrate both strengths.

Method: Proposed Warm Diffusion with Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD) using a divide-and-conquer strategy that exploits spectral dependency, disentangling denoising and deblurring processes. Analyzed Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) through spectral analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the approach for image generation.

Conclusion: Warm Diffusion successfully bridges the gap between hot and cold diffusion paradigms, providing a unified framework that leverages both noise and blurring mechanisms for improved generative performance.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks across diverse data types. While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly. Our divide-and-conquer strategy exploits the spectral dependency in images, simplifying score model estimation by disentangling the denoising and deblurring processes. We further analyze the Blur-to-Noise Ratio (BNR) using spectral analysis to investigate the trade-off between model learning dynamics and changes in the data manifold. Extensive experiments across benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality assessment methods provide only single scores, which are too coarse for targeted model improvement. Fine-grained evaluation along realism and plausibility dimensions is needed for better generative model optimization.

Method: Created Q-Real dataset with 3,088 AI-generated images annotated with entity locations, judgment questions, and attribution descriptions. Built Q-Real Bench for evaluating MLLMs on judgment and grounding tasks, and designed a fine-tuning framework.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of the dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. The approach enables effective evaluation and improvement of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: Q-Real provides a comprehensive framework for fine-grained quality assessment of AI-generated images, addressing limitations of single-score methods and enabling targeted model optimization through detailed realism and plausibility evaluation.

Abstract: Quality assessment of AI-generated content is crucial for evaluating model capability and guiding model optimization. However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the high quality and significance of our dataset and the comprehensiveness of the benchmark. Dataset and code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniModel is a unified pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework that jointly handles visual understanding and generation tasks by treating both text and images as RGB pixels in a shared visual space, eliminating modality discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve unification across three axes: model, tasks, and representations by creating a vision-native multimodal learning framework that bridges the gap between visual understanding and generation.

Method: Uses a Unified Diffusion Transformer with rectified flow in pixel space, mapping text to painted text images and treating all inputs/outputs as RGB pixels. A shared backbone learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images with lightweight task embeddings.

Result: Demonstrates strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability in text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding tasks, including cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops.

Conclusion: Unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: We present UniModel, a unified generative model that jointly supports visual understanding and visual generation within a single pixel-to-pixel diffusion framework. Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops. Our initial exploration suggests that unifying model, tasks, and representations in a single visual space is a promising paradigm for general-purpose multimodal intelligence.

*Chaoran Xu,Chengkan Lv,Qiyu Chen,Yunkang Cao,Feng Zhang,Zhengtao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno) is a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that creates realistic defects by contrasting two diffusion branches with minimal prompts, using accumulated denoising deltas to guide localized inpainting while preserving context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anomaly generation methods require fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity of anomalies and leads to overfitting category priors. The paper addresses the challenging setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available.

Method: DeltaDeno uses a training-free zero-shot approach that contrasts two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. It accumulates per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, then uses this mask to guide latent inpainting during later diffusion steps. The method includes token-level prompt refinement and spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens.

Result: Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation quality, realism, and consistent gains in downstream detection performance.

Conclusion: DeltaDeno provides an effective training-free solution for anomaly generation that works without real anomaly samples, demonstrating strong performance in generating realistic defects and improving detection tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly generation is often framed as few-shot fine-tuning with anomalous samples, which contradicts the scarcity that motivates generation and tends to overfit category priors. We tackle the setting where no real anomaly samples or training are available. We propose Delta-Denoising (DeltaDeno), a training-free zero-shot anomaly generation method that localizes and edits defects by contrasting two diffusion branches driven by a minimal prompt pair under a shared schedule. By accumulating per-step denoising deltas into an image-specific localization map, we obtain a mask to guide the latent inpainting during later diffusion steps and preserve the surrounding context while generating realistic local defects. To improve stability and control, DeltaDeno performs token-level prompt refinement that aligns shared content and strengthens anomaly tokens, and applies a spatial attention bias restricted to anomaly tokens in the predicted region. Experiments on public datasets show that DeltaDeno achieves great generation, realism and consistent gains in downstream detection performance. Code will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DM-based VSR methods suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and trade-offs between perceptual quality and fidelity due to inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames.

Method: Proposes DGAF-VSR with Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in aligned features and Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) for dense guidance in the feature domain.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: 35.82% DISTS reduction for perceptual quality, 0.20 dB PSNR gain for fidelity, and 30.37% tLPIPS reduction for temporal consistency on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods by better leveraging feature domain alignment and compensation, demonstrating superior performance across key VSR metrics.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) based Video Super-Resolution (VSR) approaches achieve impressive perceptual quality. However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DGAF-VSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in key aspects of VSR, including perceptual quality (35.82\% DISTS reduction), fidelity (0.20 dB PSNR gain), and temporal consistency (30.37\% tLPIPS reduction).

Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.

Method: Proposed OmniGround benchmark with 3,475 videos across 81 categories using Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline. Introduced DeepSTG evaluation framework and PG-TAF - a training-free two-stage framework that decomposes STVG into temporal grounding and spatio-temporal propagation.

Result: Evaluations show 10.4% performance drop on complex real-world scenes. PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m_tIoU and m_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed OmniGround benchmark and PG-TAF framework effectively address limitations in current STVG approaches, demonstrating significant improvements in handling complex real-world scenarios with diverse objects and queries.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize target objects in videos based on natural language descriptions. Despite recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models, a significant gap remains between current models and real-world demands involving diverse objects and complex queries. We attribute this to limited benchmark scope, causing models to exhibit category bias, oversimplified reasoning, and poor linguistic robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniGround, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,475 videos spanning 81 categories and complex real-world queries. We propose the Forward-Backward-Refinement annotation pipeline that combines multi-directional tracking with intelligent error correction for high-quality labels. We further introduce DeepSTG, a systematic evaluation framework quantifying dataset quality across four complementary dimensions beyond superficial statistics. Evaluations reveal performance average drop of 10.4% on complex real-world scenes, particularly with small/occluded objects and intricate spatial relations. Motivated by these, we propose PG-TAF, a training-free two-stage framework decomposing STVG into high-level temporal grounding and fine-grained spatio-temporal propagation. Experiments demonstrate PG-TAF achieves 25.6% and 35.6% improvements in m\_tIoU and m\_vIoU on OmniGround with consistent gains across four benchmarks.

TL;DR: MultiPriv is the first benchmark to evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs, revealing significant reasoning-based privacy risks that current perception-focused benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current privacy benchmarks are insufficient as they only evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the critical risk of privacy reasoning - VLMs' ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles.

Method: Proposed MultiPriv benchmark with Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR) framework, using a bilingual multimodal dataset with synthetic individual profiles where identifiers are linked to sensitive attributes, enabling nine challenging tasks across the PPR spectrum.

Result: Evaluation of 50+ VLMs reveals: (1) significant unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks, (2) perception metrics are poor predictors of reasoning risks, and (3) existing safety alignments are ineffective against reasoning-based attacks.

Conclusion: MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities in VLMs and provides a framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving models, highlighting the critical gap in current privacy evaluation methods.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate sophisticated reasoning, escalating privacy risks beyond simple attribute perception to individual-level linkage. Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap. (3) Existing safety alignments are inconsistent and ineffective against such reasoning-based attacks. MultiPriv exposes systemic vulnerabilities and provides the necessary framework for developing robust, privacy-preserving VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel implicit neural representation framework that jointly models dynamic MRI images and optical flow using physics-inspired regularization, enabling simultaneous reconstruction of high-quality images and accurate motion fields without prior flow estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic MRI faces challenges from limited sampling and motion artifacts. Traditional motion-compensated reconstructions rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality.

Method: Two implicit neural representations (INRs) are used: one parameterizes spatiotemporal image content, another represents optical flow. They are coupled via the optical flow equation as physics-inspired regularization, with data consistency loss enforcing agreement with k-space measurements.

Result: Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets show the method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints shows strong potential for advancing dynamic MRI reconstruction by simultaneously recovering temporally coherent images and motion fields.

Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) captures temporally-resolved anatomy but is often challenged by limited sampling and motion-induced artifacts. Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity. These results highlight the potential of implicit joint modeling with flow-regularized constraints for advancing dMRI reconstruction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FingerCap, a method for generating detailed finger-level hand motion descriptions from videos, addressing temporal sparsity in Video-MLLMs through FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures) that combines RGB frames with hand keypoints to capture fine finger motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication, but current methods struggle with capturing subtle finger-level dynamics due to temporal sparsity in video sampling.

Method: Proposes FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures) which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe, using a lightweight temporal encoder to convert keypoints into motion embeddings integrated with RGB features. Also introduces FingerCap-40K dataset with 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions.

Result: Experiments show strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs struggle with finger-level reasoning, while the FiGOP-augmented model achieves consistent gains under both automated HandJudge evaluation and human studies.

Conclusion: FiGOP effectively addresses temporal sparsity in Video-MLLMs for fine finger motion understanding, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density, and demonstrates superior performance in finger-level hand motion captioning.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained human hand motion is fundamental to visual perception, embodied intelligence, and multimodal communication. In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density. Experiments on FingerCap-40K show that strong open- and closed-source Video-MLLMs still struggle with finger-level reasoning, while our FiGOP-augmented model yield consistent gains under HandJudge and human studies.

*Yicheng Deng,Hideaki Hayashi,Hajime Nagahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A point-supervised facial expression spotting framework using Gaussian-based intensity modeling and two-branch architecture for detecting and classifying macro/micro-expressions with only single timestamp annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial expression spotting methods require costly temporal boundary annotations, so this work aims to develop a more efficient approach using only point supervision (single timestamp per instance) to reduce annotation burden.

Method: Two-branch framework: (1) Class-agnostic expression intensity branch with Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) for soft pseudo-labeling, and (2) Class-aware apex classification branch for macro/micro-expression distinction. Also includes intensity-aware contrastive loss for feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in facial expression spotting with point supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed point-supervised framework successfully addresses facial expression spotting with minimal annotation requirements, achieving reliable performance through Gaussian-based intensity modeling and dual-branch architecture.

Abstract: Automatic facial expression spotting, which aims to identify facial expression instances in untrimmed videos, is crucial for facial expression analysis. Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities. Extensive experiments on the SAMM-LV, CAS(ME)$^2$, and CAS(ME)$^3$ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neighbor GRPO is a new alignment algorithm for flow matching models that avoids SDE conversion by perturbing initial noise conditions and using distance-based optimization, outperforming SDE-based methods in efficiency and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE-based GRPO methods for aligning flow matching models suffer from inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Neighbor GRPO that generates diverse trajectories by perturbing initial noise conditions, uses softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy, and incorporates symmetric anchor sampling and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting.

Result: Extensive experiments show Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based methods in training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

Conclusion: Neighbor GRPO provides an effective alignment approach that preserves deterministic ODE sampling advantages while addressing limitations of SDE-based methods.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in aligning image and video generative models with human preferences. However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatPedia is a foundation model that uses a novel joint RGB-PBR representation to unify material generation tasks, enabling text-to-material, image-to-material, and intrinsic decomposition within a single architecture through video diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PBR material creation is labor-intensive and existing generative methods lack unified representations that bridge natural image appearance with PBR properties, leading to fragmented pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB data.

Method: Developed a joint RGB-PBR representation encoding materials as two interdependent latents (RGB appearance and four PBR maps) formulated as a 5-frame sequence, using video diffusion architectures to capture correlations and transfer visual priors from RGB generation models.

Result: MatPedia achieves native 1024×1024 synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity, trained on MatHybrid-410K dataset combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images.

Conclusion: The proposed joint representation enables a unified framework for multiple material tasks and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, bridging the gap between natural image appearance and physical material properties.

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) materials are fundamental to photorealistic graphics, yet their creation remains labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise. While generative models have advanced material synthesis, existing methods lack a unified representation bridging natural image appearance and PBR properties, leading to fragmented task-specific pipelines and inability to leverage large-scale RGB image data. We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture. Trained on MatHybrid-410K, a mixed corpus combining PBR datasets with large-scale RGB images, MatPedia achieves native $1024\times1024$ synthesis that substantially surpasses existing approaches in both quality and diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network for blind super-resolution that handles both blur and noise degradation through separate embeddings, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous SISR methods perform poorly when actual degradation deviates from assumed fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling), especially in blind SR scenarios where degradation is unknown.

Method: Uses a dual branch network to predict unsupervised degradation embeddings for blur and noise separately, allowing the SR network to adapt differently to each degradation type. Treats the degradation extractor as a regularizer using differences between SR and HR images.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmarks show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in blind super-resolution problems.

Conclusion: The proposed dual branch approach effectively handles blind SR by separately modeling blur and noise degradations, significantly improving performance when degradation deviates from standard assumptions.

Abstract: Previous methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in single image super-resolution (SISR) tasks with known and fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling). However, when the actual degradation deviates from these assumptions, these methods may experience significant declines in performance. In this paper, we propose a Dual Branch Degradation Extractor Network to address the blind SR problem. While some blind SR methods assume noise-free degradation and others do not explicitly consider the presence of noise in the degradation model, our approach predicts two unsupervised degradation embeddings that represent blurry and noisy information. The SR network can then be adapted to blur embedding and noise embedding in distinct ways. Furthermore, we treat the degradation extractor as a regularizer to capitalize on differences between SR and HR images. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves SOTA performance in the blind SR problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an edge-efficient method for synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs, using a cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and a novel Culinary Image Similarity metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-image generation methods produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment, making it challenging to synthesize realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices.

Method: Proposes an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image, using a domain-specific Culinary Image Similarity (CIS) metric for temporal consistency and culinary plausibility.

Result: The model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30% improvement on their dataset; 60% on public datasets).

Conclusion: The proposed method enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets and provides an effective solution for realistic food image synthesis on edge devices.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic cooked food images from raw inputs on edge devices is a challenging generative task, requiring models to capture complex changes in texture, color and structure during cooking. Existing image-to-image generation methods often produce unrealistic results or are too resource-intensive for edge deployment. We introduce the first oven-based cooking-progression dataset with chef-annotated doneness levels and propose an edge-efficient recipe and cooking state guided generator that synthesizes realistic food images conditioned on raw food image. This formulation enables user-preferred visual targets rather than fixed presets. To ensure temporal consistency and culinary plausibility, we introduce a domain-specific \textit{Culinary Image Similarity (CIS)} metric, which serves both as a training loss and a progress-monitoring signal. Our model outperforms existing baselines with significant reductions in FID scores (30\% improvement on our dataset; 60\% on public datasets)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeCLIP improves open-set domain generalization by using semantic-enhanced prompts and diffusion-generated hard negatives to better distinguish visually similar unknown classes from known ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with distinguishing 'hard unknowns' that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes, leading to over-confidence and poor performance in open-set domain generalization scenarios.

Method: Proposes Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) with: 1) semantic-aware prompt enhancement to decompose images into discriminative tokens, 2) duplex contrastive learning with repulsion and cohesion objectives, and 3) semantic-guided diffusion to synthesize pseudo-unknowns by perturbing semantic tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments across five benchmarks show consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SeeCLIP effectively addresses the dilemma between structural risk and open-space risk in open-set domain generalization through fine-grained semantic enhancement and challenging sample generation.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) tackles the realistic scenario where deployed models encounter both domain shifts and novel object categories. Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements of 3% accuracy and 5% H-score over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A natural selection-inspired pruning framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that autonomously determines which Gaussians to retain or prune through optimization gradients, achieving state-of-the-art performance with over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15% budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting uses many Gaussian primitives causing high storage and computational costs, while existing pruning methods rely on manual criteria or extra parameters with suboptimal results.

Method: Models survival pressure as regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing optimization gradients to autonomously determine Gaussian retention/pruning. Introduces opacity decay with finite opacity prior to accelerate selection.

Result: Achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15% budgets compared to original 3DGS, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The proposed learnable pruning framework effectively reduces storage and computational overhead in 3DGS without human intervention, outperforming existing methods through natural selection-inspired optimization.

Abstract: 3DGS employs a large number of Gaussian primitives to fit scenes, resulting in substantial storage and computational overhead. Existing pruning methods rely on manually designed criteria or introduce additional learnable parameters, yielding suboptimal results. To address this, we propose an natural selection inspired pruning framework that models survival pressure as a regularization gradient field applied to opacity, allowing the optimization gradients--driven by the goal of maximizing rendering quality--to autonomously determine which Gaussians to retain or prune. This process is fully learnable and requires no human intervention. We further introduce an opacity decay technique with a finite opacity prior, which accelerates the selection process without compromising pruning effectiveness. Compared to 3DGS, our method achieves over 0.6 dB PSNR gain under 15\% budgets, establishing state-of-the-art performance for compact 3DGS. Project page https://xiaobin2001.github.io/GNS-web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant diseases cause massive economic losses ($220B annually) and threaten food security. While deep ensemble methods can improve detection accuracy, selecting optimal ensemble members is challenging due to inadequate diversity measurement.

Method: 1) Comprehensive analysis of limitations in existing ensemble diversity metrics (Q metrics); 2) Development of novel SQ metric that captures synergy between ensemble members; 3) Extensive validation experiments on plant leaf image dataset.

Result: The SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy compared to existing diversity metrics, demonstrating better alignment with ensemble performance.

Conclusion: The SQ framework enables more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection by providing a superior method for selecting synergistic ensemble members.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a significant threat to global agriculture, causing over $220 billion in annual economic losses and jeopardizing food security. The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy. Our findings pave the way for a more reliable and efficient image-based plant disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex radio propagation behavior and challenging environments make accurate radiomap estimation difficult, requiring better methods that can handle both global patterns and local details.

Method: Proposed RadioKMoE framework with two main components: KAN module for initial coarse coverage map prediction using physics model approximation, and MoE network with specialized expert networks for distinct radiomap patterns to refine local details while maintaining global consistency.

Result: Experimental results show enhanced accuracy and robustness in both multi-band and single-band radiomap estimation compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The RadioKMoE framework effectively addresses radiomap estimation challenges by combining KAN's physics modeling capabilities with MoE's specialized pattern handling, demonstrating superior performance in complex wireless environments.

Abstract: Radiomap serves as a vital tool for wireless network management and deployment by providing powerful spatial knowledge of signal propagation and coverage. However, increasingly complex radio propagation behavior and surrounding environments pose strong challenges for radiomap estimation (RME). In this work, we propose a knowledge-guided RME framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), namely RadioKMoE. Specifically, we design a KAN module to predict an initial coarse coverage map, leveraging KAN's strength in approximating physics models and global radio propagation patterns. The initial coarse map, together with environmental information, drives our MoE network for precise radiomap estimation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, the MoE module comprises expert networks specializing in distinct radiomap patterns to improve local details while preserving global consistency. Experimental results in both multi- and single-band RME demonstrate the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the proposed RadioKMoE in radiomap estimation.

Motivation: To determine whether language information is necessary for visual complexity prediction and to develop a more efficient vision-only approach that can match or surpass multimodal methods.

Method: Proposed DReX architecture that integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16 using a learnable attention mechanism to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous multimodal methods while using 21.5x fewer parameters. Demonstrated robust generalization across multiple datasets and metrics (Pearson, Spearman, RMSE, MAE).

Conclusion: Visual features alone are sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction, and properly fused self-supervised transformers and supervised CNNs offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

Abstract: Visual complexity prediction is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in image compression, retrieval, and classification. Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.

Conclusion: FLUID provides an effective training-free framework for face de-identification that successfully balances identity removal with attribute preservation through latent space manipulation in diffusion models.

Abstract: We present FLUID (Face de-identification in the Latent space via Utility-preserving Identity Displacement), a training-free framework that directly substitutes identity in the latent space of pretrained diffusion models. Inspired by substitution mechanisms in chemistry, we reinterpret identity editing as semantic displacement in the latent h-space of a pretrained unconditional diffusion model.

We further propose both linear and geodesic (tangent-based) editing schemes to effectively navigate the latent manifold. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ and FFHQ demonstrate that FLUID achieves a superior trade-off between identity suppression and attribute preservation, outperforming state-of-the-art de-identification methods in both qualitative and quantitative metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depth estimation models are passive and only estimate static depth maps of the nearest surface, while humans can actively shift focus to perceive different depth layers in scenes with transparent or transmissive materials.

Method: A steerable Vision Transformer conditioned on a scalar depth preference that dynamically adapts its computation to focus on intended depth layers. Trained on a new 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset capturing diverse see-through effects.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks (BOOSTER) and demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on new multi-depth datasets. Shows strong generalization to unseen see-through scenes.

Conclusion: DepthFocus represents a significant step toward active, human-like 3D perception by enabling selective depth focus in complex scenes with transmissive materials.

Abstract: Depth in the real world is rarely singular. Transmissive materials create layered ambiguities that confound conventional perception systems. Existing models remain passive, attempting to estimate static depth maps anchored to the nearest surface, while humans actively shift focus to perceive a desired depth. We introduce DepthFocus, a steerable Vision Transformer that redefines stereo depth estimation as intent-driven control. Conditioned on a scalar depth preference, the model dynamically adapts its computation to focus on the intended depth, enabling selective perception within complex scenes. The training primarily leverages our newly constructed 500k multi-layered synthetic dataset, designed to capture diverse see-through effects. DepthFocus not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on conventional single-depth benchmarks like BOOSTER, a dataset notably rich in transparent and reflective objects, but also quantitatively demonstrates intent-aligned estimation on our newly proposed real and synthetic multi-depth datasets. Moreover, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities on unseen see-through scenes, underscoring its robustness as a significant step toward active and human-like 3D perception.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions is challenging but crucial for autonomous driving and outdoor robots.

Method: Combines lightweight encoder-decoder with VLM for chain-of-thought inference and Implicit Memory Bank storing degradation patterns. Uses cross-attention to fuse retrieved prototypes with visual features.

Result: Outperforms single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines on four severe-weather benchmarks in PSNR and SSIM metrics.

Conclusion: MVLR provides practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Reliable visual perception under adverse weather conditions, such as rain, haze, snow, or a mixture of them, is desirable yet challenging for autonomous driving and outdoor robots. In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These results indicate that MVLR offers a practical balance between model compactness and expressiveness for real-time deployment in diverse outdoor conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations overlook scenarios with multiple cultural cues, failing to test cultural stability crucial for supporting diverse societies.

Method: Developed ConfusedTourist benchmark with image-stacking and image-generation perturbations to test VLM stability against mixed cultural inputs.

Result: Experiments show critical vulnerability - accuracy drops heavily under simple perturbations, with systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues.

Conclusion: Visual cultural concept mixing substantially impairs state-of-the-art VLMs, highlighting urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Although the cultural dimension has been one of the key aspects in evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their ability to remain stable across diverse cultural inputs remains largely untested, despite being crucial to support diversity and multicultural societies. Existing evaluations often rely on benchmarks featuring only a singular cultural concept per image, overlooking scenarios where multiple, potentially unrelated cultural cues coexist. To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus. These findings highlight a critical challenge: visual cultural concept mixing can substantially impair even state-of-the-art VLMs, underscoring the urgent need for more culturally robust multimodal understanding.

Evaluated established baselines and discovered that CrossAttention mechanism is essential for effective multi-modal fusion of racket pose features.

Result: Evaluation revealed that naive concatenation of racket pose features degrades performance, while CrossAttention mechanism unlocks their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines.

Abstract: We introduce RacketVision, a novel dataset and benchmark for advancing computer vision in sports analytics, covering table tennis, tennis, and badminton. The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

### [44] [OmniPT: Unleashing the Potential of Large Vision Language Models for Pedestrian Tracking and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17053)
*Teng Fu,Mengyang Zhao,Ke Niu,Kaixin Peng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniPT is a unified pedestrian tracking framework that leverages LVLMs to perform tracking, reference-based tracking, and semantic understanding of tracked objects through a multi-phase training approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel at semantic understanding but lag behind expert models in instance-level tasks like visual grounding and object detection. Pedestrian tracking tasks increasingly require advanced semantic understanding, making LVLMs well-suited for these applications.

Method: A three-phase training approach: RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. First RL enables bounding box format output, mid-training uses pedestrian datasets, supervised fine-tuning on tracking datasets, and final RL improves tracking performance and instruction following.

Result: Experimental results on tracking benchmarks show the proposed method outperforms previous approaches.

Conclusion: OmniPT successfully bridges the gap between LVLMs and instance-level tracking tasks, demonstrating superior performance in pedestrian tracking with semantic understanding capabilities.

Abstract: LVLMs have been shown to perform excellently in image-level tasks such as VQA and caption. However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReBrain is a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework that synthesizes brain MRI from sparse CT scans using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model and reference-guided generation via ControlNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI is crucial for brain disease diagnosis but not always feasible for certain patients. Current CT-to-MRI synthesis methods struggle with highly sparse CT volumes from low-dose protocols, making accurate full brain MRI reconstruction challenging.

Method: Proposes ReBrain framework that: 1) Uses Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to synthesize MRI slices from 3D CT scans with limited slices, 2) Retrieves structurally similar CT slices from database via fine-tuned retrieval model, 3) Incorporates retrieved slices as references through ControlNet branch to guide generation and ensure structural continuity, 4) Handles rare retrieval failures with spherical linear interpolation.

Result: Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS datasets demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal MRI reconstruction under sparse CT conditions.

Conclusion: ReBrain effectively addresses the challenge of synthesizing full brain MRI volumes from sparse CT scans through its retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, providing accurate cross-modal reconstruction for clinical applications where MRI is not feasible.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in brain disease diagnosis, but it is not always feasible for certain patients due to physical or clinical constraints. Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR modeling uses spanning tree traversal orders to maintain sampling performance while enabling flexible sequence orders for image editing, addressing limitations of random permutations in autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the performance decline or flexibility limitations in conventional autoregressive models when using randomly permuted sequence orders for bidirectional context in visual generation.

Method: Utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice of image patches, obtained through breadth-first search and rejection sampling to ensure connected partial observation appears as a prefix in the sequence.

Result: STAR preserves postfix completion capability while maintaining sampling performance without significant changes to existing autoregressive model architectures.

Conclusion: STAR provides a tailored yet structured randomized strategy that enables flexible sequence order choice for image editing while preserving the performance of autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.

TL;DR: RoomPlanner is the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework that creates realistic indoor scenes from short text prompts without manual layout design or panoramic images, achieving generation in under 30 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable painless creation of realistic 3D indoor scenes using only short text inputs, eliminating the need for manual layout design or panoramic image guidance.

Method: Uses hierarchical language-driven agent planners to parse ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions, initializes 3D point clouds, implements iterative arrangement constraints for collision-free layouts, and employs AnyReach Sampling and Interval Timestep Flow Sampling for efficient 3D Gaussian scene optimization.

Result: Generates geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes with superior rendering speed and visual quality compared to prior approaches, while maintaining editability and completing generation in under 30 minutes.

Conclusion: RoomPlanner successfully demonstrates fully automatic 3D room generation from text, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and quality while preserving scene editability.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RoomPlanner, the first fully automatic 3D room generation framework for painlessly creating realistic indoor scenes with only short text as input. Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can produce geometrically rational 3D indoor scenes, surpassing prior approaches in both rendering speed and visual quality while preserving editability. The code will be available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathAgent is an LLM-based agent framework that mimics human pathologists' stepwise reasoning process for analyzing whole-slide images, providing fully interpretable predictions through explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational pipelines for whole-slide image analysis lack explicit reasoning trajectories, resulting in opaque and unjustifiable predictions that don't mirror how human pathologists dynamically collect evidence through iterative zooming, refocusing, and self-correction.

Method: PathAgent uses three modules: Navigator for iterative micro-region localization, Perceptor for morphology visual cue extraction, and Executor for integrating findings into natural language trajectories. The entire sequence forms an explicit chain-of-thought.

Result: PathAgent demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across five challenging datasets, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms its clinical utility.

Conclusion: PathAgent represents a promising transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant that successfully emulates human pathologists' reflective, stepwise analytical approach for whole-slide image analysis.

Abstract: Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of real-time detection in remote sensing imagery where small objects are prevalent and there's a need to balance accuracy with computational efficiency.

Method: Proposes DMG-YOLO with: 1) Dual-branch Feature Extraction module using depthwise separable convolutions for local features and vision transformer with gating for global context; 2) Multi-scale Feature Fusion module with dilated convolutions; 3) Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network for enhanced small object detection.

Conclusion: DMG-YOLO effectively addresses the challenges of small object detection in remote sensing imagery while maintaining real-time performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery is widely used across various fields, yet real-time detection remains challenging due to the prevalence of small objects and the need to balance accuracy with efficiency. To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets show that DMG-YOLO achieves competitive performance in terms of mAP, model size, and other key metrics.

*Bhanu Pratap Paregi,Vaibhav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-AD-Net is a reinforcement learning framework that refines point cloud completions in latent space using a pretrained autoencoder, improving geometric consistency through selective feature adjustments and a PointNN selector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud completion models produce globally plausible shapes but suffer from local geometric inconsistencies, requiring a refinement approach that enhances geometric fidelity without retraining the original models.

Method: Uses RL agent to adjust global feature vectors in a pretrained autoencoder's latent space, with PointNN selector evaluating geometric consistency and retaining better reconstructions. Training is category-specific due to RL convergence challenges.

Result: Outperforms baseline completion networks, especially in random cropping scenarios, and consistently improves completions across different settings while being lightweight and model-agnostic.

Conclusion: RL-AD-Net effectively refines point cloud completions through RL-guided ensemble refinement, providing modular and model-agnostic improvements to geometric consistency without requiring retraining of completion networks.

Abstract: Recent point cloud completion models, including transformer-based, denoising-based, and other state-of-the-art approaches, generate globally plausible shapes from partial inputs but often leave local geometric inconsistencies. We propose RL-AD-Net, a reinforcement learning (RL) refinement framework that operates in the latent space of a pretrained point autoencoder. The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work. Experiments on ShapeNetCore-2048 demonstrate that while baseline completion networks perform reasonable under their training-style cropping, they struggle in random cropping scenarios. In contrast, RL-AD-Net consistently delivers improvements across both settings, highlighting the effectiveness of RL-guided ensemble refinement. The approach is lightweight, modular, and model-agnostic, making it applicable to a wide range of completion networks without requiring retraining.

TL;DR: REArtGS++ improves articulated object reconstruction by introducing temporal geometry constraints and planar Gaussian splatting, addressing limitations in handling screw-joint objects and unseen states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like REArtGS struggle with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lack geometric constraints for unseen states, limiting generalizable articulated object reconstruction.

Method: Proposes decoupled screw motion modeling without type prior, joint optimization of part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through motion blending, and temporally consistent regularization using planar Gaussians and Taylor expansion.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate superior performance in part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: REArtGS++ effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods by incorporating temporal geometry constraints and planar Gaussian splatting, achieving better generalization for articulated object reconstruction.

Abstract: Articulated objects are pervasive in daily environments, such as drawers and refrigerators. Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from diversity collapse similar to few-step distilled diffusion models, reducing output variability despite their efficiency advantages over traditional AR and diffusion models.

Method: Suppress pivotal components in model input and amplify them in model output to unlock inherent generative potential without requiring additional training.

Result: Substantially enhances generative diversity with negligible performance impact, preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR effectively addresses diversity collapse in VAR models through simple feature map manipulation, offering a practical solution that maintains efficiency and image quality while restoring output variability.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have recently garnered significant attention for their innovative next-scale prediction paradigm, offering notable advantages in both inference efficiency and image quality compared to traditional multi-step autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. However, despite their efficiency, VAR models often suffer from the diversity collapse i.e., a reduction in output variability, analogous to that observed in few-step distilled diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances generative diversity with only neglectable performance influences. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wangtong627/DiverseVAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing articulated object reconstruction methods require costly multi-stage and multi-view observations, creating limitations for practical applications.

Method: Uses planar Gaussian Splatting with a Gaussian information field to select optimal viewpoints, compresses 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians for normal and depth estimation, optimizes through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion, and incorporates part segmentation probability with back-projection of segmentation masks.

Result: Achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconstructs articulated objects using only sparse-view RGB images from a single state, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required more extensive input data.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in daily environments, and their 3D reconstruction holds great significance across various fields. However, existing articulated object reconstruction methods typically require costly inputs such as multi-stage and multi-view observations. To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher-fidelity part-level surface reconstruction on both synthetic and real-world data than existing methods. Codes will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a comprehensive intervention framework targeting hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models by analyzing and intervening on different causal pathways in the transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite impressive performance, LVLMs remain prone to hallucination, and current approaches don't fully address the multi-pathway nature of this problem.

Method: The framework analyzes three causal pathways (image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, text-to-text) and intervenes on critical hallucination heads using tailored methods for discriminative and generative question-answer formats.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent reduction in hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

Conclusion: Hallucinations in LVLMs stem from interplay among multiple pathways, and targeted intervention on critical heads can effectively mitigate this issue.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain prone to hallucination. In this study, we propose a comprehensive intervention framework aligned with the transformer's causal architecture in LVLMs, integrating the effects of different intervention paths on hallucination. We find that hallucinations in LVLMs do not arise from a single causal path, but rather from the interplay among image-to-input-text, image-to-output-text, and text-to-text pathways. For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces hallucinations across diverse alignment types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCoVAD is a training-free video anomaly detection framework that uses selective frame processing inspired by human nervous system pathways, achieving state-of-the-art performance while processing only 28.55% and 16.04% of frames compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free VAD methods rely on dense frame-level inference, which incurs high computational costs and latency. The paper questions whether dense reasoning is truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models.

Method: ReCoVAD uses a dual-pathway approach: (1) Reflex pathway with lightweight CLIP-based module for fast response using dynamic memory, and (2) Conscious pathway with medium-scale vision-language model for refined analysis and periodic review by large language model to identify unseen anomalies and update prototypes.

Result: ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55% and 16.04% of frames on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets respectively, demonstrating sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

Conclusion: Sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective video anomaly detection when using powerful pre-trained models, and the proposed ReCoVAD framework successfully reduces computational costs while maintaining high performance through selective frame processing.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a vital role in real-world applications such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and industrial monitoring. Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\% and 16.04\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.

TL;DR: SketchVerify is a training-free framework that improves video generation by planning and verifying motion trajectories before full synthesis, using sketch-based verification to ensure physical plausibility and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods use single-shot motion plans limited to simple motions or iterative refinement requiring multiple expensive video generation calls, leading to computational inefficiency and poor motion quality.

Method: Proposes a sketch-verification-based planning framework that predicts multiple candidate motion plans, renders them as lightweight video sketches over static backgrounds, and uses a vision-language verifier to rank trajectories based on semantic alignment and physical plausibility.

Result: Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench show significant improvements in motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to baselines, while being substantially more efficient.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves motion planning quality through test-time sampling and verification, with performance scaling consistently as the number of trajectory candidates increases.

Abstract: Recent video generation approaches increasingly rely on planning intermediate control signals such as object trajectories to improve temporal coherence and motion fidelity. However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.

TL;DR: A novel method for generating synthetic LiDAR point clouds by editing real-world scans using semantic mask guidance and diffusion-based generation in 2D range view space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training autonomous driving systems rely on simulated point cloud data from handcrafted 3D environments, which is time-consuming, expensive, and fails to capture real-world complexity. There's a need for diverse edge case scenarios that are challenging to acquire from real data.

Method: Transform LiDAR point clouds to 2D range view images, use convex hull-based semantic masks to guide diffusion-based generation, ensuring geometric consistency by preserving object dimensions, orientations, and locations from real environments.

Result: The approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, validated on the KITTI-360 dataset.

Conclusion: This method provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems by enabling better training with edge case scenarios.

Abstract: Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.

### [58] [Bridging Visual Affective Gap: Borrowing Textual Knowledge by Learning from Noisy Image-Text Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17103)
*Daiqing Wu,Dongbao Yang,Yu Zhou,Can Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to bridge the 'affective gap' in visual emotion recognition by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained textual models, using distinct contrastive learning strategies for different sample types in noisy social media data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual emotion recognition suffers from an 'affective gap' where factual-level visual features lack direct association with emotional categories, limiting the effectiveness of pre-trained visual models for emotion tasks.

Method: Proposed Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) that separates different types of samples and uses distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type, dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs to exploit noisy social media data.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show that bridging the affective gap significantly improves performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks.

Conclusion: Borrowing knowledge from pre-trained textual models effectively enhances emotional perception of visual models by addressing the affective gap through adaptive contrastive learning strategies.

Abstract: Visual emotion recognition (VER) is a longstanding field that has garnered increasing attention with the advancement of deep neural networks. Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the "affective gap", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the "affective gap". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that bridging the "affective gap" significantly improves the performance of various pre-trained visual models in downstream emotion-related tasks. Our code is released on https://github.com/wdqqdw/PACL.

*Chuancheng Shi,Shangze Li,Shiming Guo,Simiao Xie,Wenhua Wu,Jingtong Dou,Chao Wu,Canran Xiao,Cong Wang,Zifeng Cheng,Fei Shen,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses cultural bias in multilingual text-to-image models, showing they often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results. The authors identify culture-sensitive neurons and propose two alignment strategies to improve cultural consistency without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual T2I models produce culturally inconsistent outputs across languages, often defaulting to culturally neutral or English-biased representations despite having cultural knowledge, due to insufficient activation of culture-related representations.

Method: 1) A probing method to localize culture-sensitive signals to specific neurons in fixed layers; 2) Two alignment strategies: inference-time cultural activation (amplifying identified neurons without fine-tuning) and layer-targeted cultural enhancement (updating only culturally relevant layers).

Result: Experiments on CultureBench show consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address cultural bias in multilingual T2I models by targeting specific culture-sensitive neurons and layers, achieving better cultural alignment without sacrificing output quality.

Abstract: Multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in terms of visual realism and semantic alignment, and are now widely utilized. Yet outputs vary across cultural contexts: because language carries cultural connotations, images synthesized from multilingual prompts should preserve cross-lingual cultural consistency. We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers. Experiments on our CultureBench demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines in cultural consistency while preserving fidelity and diversity.

*Yuan Zhang,Ming Lu,Junwen Pan,Tao Huang,Kuan Cheng,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChainV is a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into multimodal reasoning to make reasoning shorter and more efficient, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency on math-intensive benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models exhibit redundant self-reflection in lengthy reasoning chains, and existing CoT compression methods provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning due to static visual references.

Method: ChainV performs coarse visual patch selection based on previous reasoning steps, refines it using averaged attention intensity to identify representative atomic visual hints, and incorporates pixel coordinates with reliability assessment through a Bernoulli stochastic process.

Result: ChainV achieves 2.3% improvement on MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, reduces inference latency by 51.4%, and shortens output token length by 24.5%.

Conclusion: ChainV significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency in multimodal reasoning, particularly for math-intensive tasks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal reasoning models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across text and vision. However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning. For example, ChainV achieves $2.3\%$ improvement on the MathVista within MIMO-VL-RL, while reducing inference latency by $51.4\%$ and shortening output token length by $24.5\%$.

Motivation: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales is challenging due to modeling limitations, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency.

Method: Integrates physical priors with event stream enhancement in 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline; uses triple-level supervision with acceleration constraint, event stream guidance, and Kalman regularizer; implements motion-aware simulated annealing training strategy.

Result: Superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods; created first RGB-Event paired dataset for natural fast rigid motion.

Conclusion: PEGS framework effectively addresses rigid motion reconstruction challenges through physical priors, event stream enhancement, and adaptive training strategies, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Reconstruction of rigid motion over large spatiotemporal scales remains a challenging task due to limitations in modeling paradigms, severe motion blur, and insufficient physical consistency. In this work, we propose PEGS, a framework that integrates Physical priors with Event stream enhancement within a 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline to perform deblurred target-focused modeling and motion recovery. We introduce a cohesive triple-level supervision scheme that enforces physical plausibility via an acceleration constraint, leverages event streams for high-temporal resolution guidance, and employs a Kalman regularizer to fuse multi-source observations. Furthermore, we design a motion-aware simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules the training process based on real-time kinematic states. We also contribute the first RGB-Event paired dataset targeting natural, fast rigid motion across diverse scenarios. Experiments show PEGS's superior performance in reconstructing motion over large spatiotemporal scales compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

TL;DR: MuM extends masked autoencoding (MAE) to multiple views of the same scene for 3D vision, outperforming DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on geometric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised learning methods focus on semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. The authors aim to learn features specifically tailored for 3D vision by building on Cross-View Completion (CroCo) work.

Method: Extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene by uniformly masking all views and using a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, creating a simpler and more scalable approach than CroCo.

Result: MuM outperforms state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2 on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching, and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-view masked autoencoding approach effectively learns geometric representations for 3D vision tasks and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning on images seeks to extract meaningful visual representations from unlabeled data. When scaled to large datasets, this paradigm has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the resulting trained models such as DINOv3 have seen widespread adoption. However, most prior efforts are optimized for semantic understanding rather than geometric reasoning. One important exception is Cross-View Completion, CroCo, which is a form of masked autoencoding (MAE) tailored for 3D understanding. In this work, we continue on the path proposed by CroCo and focus on learning features tailored for 3D vision. In a nutshell, we extend MAE to arbitrarily many views of the same scene. By uniformly masking all views and employing a lightweight decoder with inter-frame attention, our approach is inherently simpler and more scalable than CroCo. We evaluate the resulting model, MuM, extensively on downstream tasks including feedforward reconstruction, dense image matching and relative pose estimation, finding that it outperforms the state-of-the-art visual encoders DINOv3 and CroCo v2.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes replacing traditional 1D CCT-based colorimetric mapping with a 2D chromaticity approach using a lightweight MLP, achieving 22% average error reduction for LED lighting while maintaining compatibility with traditional illuminants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern LED lighting deviates significantly from Planckian illuminants, exposing limitations of conventional CCT-based interpolation methods that rely on one-dimensional color temperature characterization.

Method: Transition from 1D CCT to 2D chromaticity space and replace CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained using a lightbox-based calibration procedure with representative LED sources.

Result: The method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time deployment with negligible computational cost.

Conclusion: Using 2D chromaticity features with MLP-based mapping significantly improves colorimetric accuracy for non-Planckian illuminants like LEDs while preserving real-time performance and compatibility with existing systems.

Abstract: Traditional in-camera colorimetric mapping relies on correlated color temperature (CCT)-based interpolation between pre-calibrated transforms optimized for Planckian illuminants such as CIE A and D65. However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.

### [65] [A Multi-Stage Optimization Framework for Deploying Learned Image Compression on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17135)
*Jiaxun Fang,Li Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage optimization framework for deploying deep learning-based image compression models on FPGAs, addressing quantization degradation through dynamic range-aware quantization and hardware-aware optimizations including mixed-precision search and channel pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying high-performance floating-point deep learning image compression models on resource-constrained FPGAs is challenging due to quantization-induced performance degradation and hardware limitations.

Method: Proposed Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) with activation clipping and weight regularization, followed by progressive mixed-precision search for optimal bit-width assignment and channel pruning adapted for GDN layers.

Result: DRAQ reduced BD-rate overhead from 30% to 6.3%, and hardware optimizations further reduced computational complexity by over 20% with negligible RD performance impact, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient integer FPGA implementations, yielding superior quality compared to existing FPGA-based image compression solutions.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image compression (LIC) has achieved state-of-the-art rate-distortion (RD) performance, yet deploying these models on resource-constrained FPGAs remains a major challenge. This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\%$ to $6.3\%$. The subsequent hardware-aware optimizations further reduce computational complexity by over $20\%$ with negligible impact on RD performance, yielding a final model that is both state-of-the-art in efficiency and superior in quality to existing FPGA-based LIC implementations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-ViT is a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for Vision Transformers that addresses computational inefficiency in multi-channel image processing by treating each channel as an expert and using a lightweight router to select only relevant channels for attention, reducing FLOPs while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformers face computational bottlenecks when processing multi-channel images due to quadratic growth in attention from channel-wise comparisons, leading to excessive FLOPs and high training costs. The key challenge is capturing interactions between channels without modeling all possible channel interactions.

Method: Proposed MoE-ViT architecture that treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention computation, inspired by Sparse Mixture-of-Experts philosophy.

Result: Proof-of-concept experiments on JUMP-CP and So2Sat datasets show substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing performance, and in some cases even enhancing performance compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: MoE-ViT provides a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging by achieving significant computational efficiency improvements while maintaining or improving model performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers ($\text{ViTs}$) have become the backbone of vision foundation models, yet their optimization for multi-channel domains - such as cell painting or satellite imagery - remains underexplored. A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: "Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODTSR is a one-step diffusion transformer for real-world image super-resolution that balances fidelity and controllability using a noise-hybrid visual stream design and fidelity-aware adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution methods struggle with balancing fidelity and controllability - multi-step methods have generative diversity but low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning.

Method: ODTSR uses a noise-hybrid visual stream (NVS) design with two streams: one receives low-quality images with adjustable noise for control, and another receives LQs with consistent noise as prior. It employs fidelity-aware adversarial training (FAA) to enable one-step inference while maintaining controllability.

Result: ODTSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on generic real-world image super-resolution and enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios like Chinese character text image super-resolution without training on specific datasets.

Conclusion: ODTSR successfully addresses the fidelity-controllability trade-off in real-world image super-resolution through its noise-hybrid visual stream design and fidelity-aware adversarial training, achieving both high performance and flexible control capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have demonstrated remarkable perceptual quality, yet the balance between fidelity and controllability remains a problem: multi-step diffusion-based methods suffer from generative diversity and randomness, resulting in low fidelity, while one-step methods lose control flexibility due to fidelity-specific finetuning. In this paper, we present ODTSR, a one-step diffusion transformer based on Qwen-Image that performs Real-ISR considering fidelity and controllability simultaneously: a newly introduced visual stream receives low-quality images (LQ) with adjustable noise (Control Noise), and the original visual stream receives LQs with consistent noise (Prior Noise), forming the Noise-hybrid Visual Stream (NVS) design. ODTSR further employs Fidelity-aware Adversarial Training (FAA) to enhance controllability and achieve one-step inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ODTSR not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on generic Real-ISR, but also enables prompt controllability on challenging scenarios such as real-world scene text image super-resolution (STISR) of Chinese characters without training on specific datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional loss functions like Dice under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to overall loss, requiring instance-wise approaches for better lesion detection.

Method: Introduces CC-DiceCE loss based on CC-Metrics framework, benchmarked against blob loss and DiceCE baseline using nnU-Net framework for standardized evaluation across multiple datasets.

Result: CC-DiceCE increases lesion detection (recall) with minimal degradation in segmentation performance, though slightly increases false positives, and generally outperforms blob loss in multi-dataset study.

Conclusion: CC-DiceCE is an effective loss function for improving small lesion detection in medical image segmentation while maintaining good segmentation quality, showing superior performance compared to existing instance-wise loss functions.

Abstract: Traditional loss functions in medical image segmentation, such as Dice, often under-segment small lesions because their small relative volume contributes negligibly to the overall loss. To address this, instance-wise loss functions and metrics have been proposed to evaluate segmentation quality on a per-lesion basis. We introduce CC-DiceCE, a loss function based on the CC-Metrics framework, and compare it with the existing blob loss. Both are benchmarked against a DiceCE baseline within the nnU-Net framework, which provides a robust and standardized setup. We find that CC-DiceCE loss increases detection (recall) with minimal to no degradation in segmentation performance, albeit at the cost of slightly more false positives. Furthermore, our multi-dataset study shows that CC-DiceCE generally outperforms blob loss.

TL;DR: A knowledge distillation framework using teacher networks fine-tuned on small task-relevant datasets to mitigate shortcut learning in medical image analysis, achieving comparable performance to bias-free models on various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often learn shortcuts using spurious correlations, which can lead to poor robustness and patient harm by preventing models from using clinically meaningful features.

Method: Proposed knowledge distillation framework leveraging teacher networks fine-tuned on small subsets of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in student networks trained on large biased datasets. Evaluated on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using multiple architectures.

Result: Consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. Achieved comparable performance to baseline models trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates practical applicability for real-world medical imaging where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify beforehand, effectively targeting different types of shortcuts across network layers.

Abstract: Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRefiner is a two-stage trajectory prediction framework that combines discriminative trajectory proposals with generative diffusion-based refinement to achieve state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative methods for trajectory prediction rely on denoising human-crafted anchors or random noise, leaving significant room for improvement in performance and scene compliance.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Transformer-based Proposal Decoder generates coarse predictions using predefined trajectory anchors, 2) Diffusion Refiner iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions with a fine-grained denoising decoder for enhanced scene compliance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, setting new records on both benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed DiffRefiner framework effectively enhances diffusion-based planning by incorporating discriminative trajectory proposals and fine-grained scene compliance, validated through ablation studies.

Abstract: Unlike discriminative approaches in autonomous driving that predict a fixed set of candidate trajectories of the ego vehicle, generative methods, such as diffusion models, learn the underlying distribution of future motion, enabling more flexible trajectory prediction. However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process. Furthermore, we design a fine-grained denoising decoder to enhance scene compliance, enabling more accurate trajectory prediction through enhanced alignment with the surrounding environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffRefiner achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 87.4 EPDMS on NAVSIM v2, and 87.1 DS along with 71.4 SR on Bench2Drive, thereby setting new records on both public benchmarks. The effectiveness of each component is validated via ablation studies as well.

*Binger Chen,Tacettin Emre Bök,Behnood Rasti,Volker Markl,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RS-FMD, a structured database of over 150 remote sensing foundation models, and REMSA, an LLM-based agent that automatically selects appropriate models from natural language queries using in-context learning and transparent justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are widely used in remote sensing but selecting appropriate models is challenging due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints.

Method: Created RS-FMD database covering 150+ RSFMs across multiple modalities, then built REMSA - an LLM-based agent that interprets user queries, resolves constraints, ranks candidates using in-context learning, and provides justifications.

Result: REMSA outperformed baselines including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs on a benchmark of 75 expert-verified query scenarios (900 configurations).

Conclusion: REMSA provides effective automated RSFM selection from natural language queries using only publicly available metadata, addressing the model selection challenge in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are increasingly used in remote sensing (RS) for tasks such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and land-use mapping. These models include unimodal vision encoders trained on a single data modality and multimodal architectures trained on combinations of SAR, multispectral, hyperspectral, and image-text data. They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.

*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI-Styler is a novel ultrasound-specific image style transfer framework that addresses domain shifts in ultrasound images across different devices. It uses pattern matching for texture transfer and class-aware prompting with pseudo labels to ensure semantic alignment with diagnostic categories, outperforming existing unpaired image translation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound images vary across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. Existing unpaired image translation methods often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, leading to misaligned content-class mappings that impair diagnostic accuracy.

Method: UI-Styler uses a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns from target images onto source images while preserving source structural content. It introduces a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain to enforce accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

Result: Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks show that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing unpaired image translation methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation.

Conclusion: UI-Styler effectively addresses domain shifts in ultrasound imaging by combining texture pattern transfer with class-aware semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance in cross-device ultrasound tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The appearance of ultrasound images varies across acquisition devices, causing domain shifts that degrade the performance of fixed black-box downstream inference models when reused. To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories. Extensive experiments on ultrasound cross-device tasks demonstrate that UI-Styler consistently outperforms existing UIT methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distribution distance and downstream tasks, such as classification and segmentation.

TL;DR: FireScope is a VLM-based framework that uses reasoning traces to predict wildfire risk maps, achieving strong cross-continental generalization from USA training to European testing while providing interpretable reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wildfire risk prediction methods lack causal reasoning and multimodal understanding needed for reliable generalization across different geographic regions.

Method: Proposed FireScope framework uses reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces, trained on FireScope-Bench dataset with Sentinel-2 imagery, climate data, and expert-defined risk rasters.

Result: FireScope achieves substantial performance gains when trained in USA and tested in Europe, with expert feedback confirming faithful and semantically meaningful reasoning traces.

Conclusion: Reasoning can ground raster prediction models to improve both generalization and interpretability, demonstrating first framework to show language-based reasoning improves generalization in visual generation and enables cross-continental wildfire risk modeling.

Abstract: Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available.

*Dragos-Alexandru Boldisor,Stefan Smeu,Dan Oneata,Elisabeta Oneata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised representations show promise for audio-visual deepfake detection but struggle with cross-dataset generalization despite capturing meaningful patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate self-supervised representations for audio-visual deepfake detection across modalities and domains, as their potential remains underexplored compared to isolated or complex architectural approaches.

Method: Systematic evaluation across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content), assessing detection effectiveness, interpretability, and cross-modal complementarity of self-supervised features.

Result: Most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information that is complementary across modalities, with models attending to semantically meaningful regions rather than artifacts. However, none generalize reliably across datasets due to dataset characteristics rather than superficial pattern learning.

Conclusion: Self-supervised representations learn meaningful patterns for deepfake detection but face fundamental challenges in achieving robust cross-domain performance, exposing both promise and limitations of this approach.

Abstract: Self-supervised representations excel at many vision and speech tasks, but their potential for audio-visual deepfake detection remains underexplored. Unlike prior work that uses these features in isolation or buried within complex architectures, we systematically evaluate them across modalities (audio, video, multimodal) and domains (lip movements, generic visual content). We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.

TL;DR: This paper introduces INTSD, a large-scale Indian nighttime traffic sign dataset, and LENS-Net, a novel framework combining adaptive image enhancement with multimodal classification for robust nighttime traffic sign recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic sign recognition at night remains challenging due to visual noise and lack of public nighttime datasets, with existing methods struggling under low illumination and failing to effectively use multimodal cues.

Method: Proposed LENS-Net framework with: 1) adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, and 2) structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier using cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning.

Result: The method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of key components. INTSD dataset spans 41 traffic sign classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a comprehensive solution for nighttime traffic sign recognition, with both dataset and code made publicly available for research purposes.

Abstract: Traffic signboards are vital for road safety and intelligent transportation systems, enabling navigation and autonomous driving. Yet, recognizing traffic signs at night remains challenging due to visual noise and scarcity of public nighttime datasets. Despite advances in vision architectures, existing methods struggle with robustness under low illumination and fail to leverage complementary mutlimodal cues effectively. To overcome these limitations, firstly, we introduce INTSD, a large-scale dataset comprising street-level night-time images of traffic signboards collected across diverse regions of India. The dataset spans 41 traffic signboard classes captured under varying lighting and weather conditions, providing a comprehensive benchmark for both detection and classification tasks. To benchmark INTSD for night-time sign recognition, we conduct extensive evaluations using state-of-the-art detection and classification models. Secondly, we propose LENS-Net, which integrates an adaptive image enhancement detector for joint illumination correction and sign localization, followed by a structured multimodal CLIP-GCNN classifier that leverages cross-modal attention and graph-based reasoning for robust and semantically consistent recognition. Our method surpasses existing frameworks, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its key components. The dataset and code for LENS-Net is publicly available for research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PostCam is a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes, achieving superior camera control precision and video quality through a query-shared cross-attention module and two-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies that limit control precision and fail to preserve fine visual details from source videos.

Method: Introduces a query-shared cross-attention module that integrates 6-DoF camera poses and 2D rendered video frames into a unified representation, using a two-stage training strategy: first learning coarse camera control from poses, then incorporating visual information for refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality on both real-world and synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: PostCam provides more accurate and flexible motion manipulation for novel-view video generation, significantly improving both control precision and visual fidelity compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose PostCam, a framework for novel-view video generation that enables post-capture editing of camera trajectories in dynamic scenes. We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

*Yingkai Zhang,Tao Zhang,Jing Nie,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage noise-decoupling framework for HSI denoising that decomposes complex noise into explicit and implicit components, using pre-training for explicit noise and high-frequency wavelet networks for implicit noise, with joint fine-tuning to optimize performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing noise modeling methods struggle with accurately modeling complex real-world noise in hyperspectral images, limiting denoising effectiveness. The complex nature of captured HSI noise requires a more sophisticated approach beyond simple noise modeling.

Method: Multi-stage framework that decouples noise into explicit and implicit components. Uses existing noise models for pre-training on explicit noise, then employs high-frequency wavelet guided network for implicit noise removal. Implements separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning strategy to optimize performance and reduce error accumulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and captured datasets show the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-stage noise-decoupling framework successfully addresses the limitations of traditional noise modeling approaches by decomposing complex noise and using adaptive learning strategies, resulting in superior denoising performance for real-world hyperspectral images.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial step in enhancing the quality of HSIs. Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework. Extensive experiments on public and our captured datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively handling complex real-world noise and significantly enhancing HSI quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models struggle with spatiotemporally coherent manipulation due to limitations in achieving temporally coherent control over action execution, despite embedding 3D positions into visual representations.

Method: Two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation by extracting visual features, embedding 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fusing via cross-attention; 2) Spatiotemporal action representation extending conventional spatial actions with temporal information for planning and aligning multimodal representations into LLM.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority across different robotic manipulation tasks, with the model achieving spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent manipulation.

Conclusion: VLA-4D provides a unified framework that jointly enables spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent robotic manipulation through its 4D-aware representations and spatiotemporal action planning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models show potential for general robotic tasks, but remain challenging in spatiotemporally coherent manipulation, which requires fine-grained representations. Typically, existing methods embed 3D positions into visual representations to enhance the spatial precision of actions. However, these methods struggle to achieve temporally coherent control over action execution. In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent. In addition, we extend the VLA dataset with temporal action annotations for fine-tuning our model. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the superiority of our method across different tasks of robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous privacy policies prevent joint training on pooled medical datasets, and SAM's computational overhead limits practical deployment despite its strong zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Introduces Alignment Layer for feature distribution alignment and CA-SAM framework that automatically adapts these layers for continual learning while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual learning scenarios.

Conclusion: The SAM paradigm is highly effective for medical segmentation when computational efficiency is balanced, and CA-SAM provides a practical solution for continual learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, heterogeneous privacy policies across institutions often make joint training on pooled datasets infeasible, motivating continual image segmentation-learning from data streams without catastrophic forgetting. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets. Experimented across nine medical segmentation datasets under continual-learning scenario, CA-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SING3R-SLAM provides an effective solution for globally consistent dense 3D mapping that outperforms existing methods in multiple metrics while being memory-efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction enable the accurate capture of local geometry; however, integrating them into SLAM is challenging due to drift and redundant point maps, which limit efficiency and downstream tasks, such as novel view synthesis.

The framework jointly optimizes a local transformer for high-resolution volumetric feature extraction and a global transformer for whole-scan context modeling, making large-scale 3D attention computationally tractable. Notably, SPECTRE is trained exclusively on openly available CT datasets, demonstrating that high-performing, generalizable representations can be achieved without relying on private data. Pretraining combines DINO-style self-distillation with SigLIP-based vision-language alignment using paired radiology reports, yielding features that are both geometrically consistent and clinically meaningful.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic image super-resolution faces challenges with limited real-world LR-HR data and complex degradation patterns. Pre-trained models from synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge that can improve generalization and reduce data requirements.

Method: Proposes Dual-domain Adaptation Networks with spatial-domain adaptation through selective parameter updating and low-rank adaptation, plus a frequency domain adaptation branch that combines spectral data of input and intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps.

Result: Experimental evaluations on RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts pre-trained SR models to real-world scenarios, achieving superior performance on realistic image super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Realistic image super-resolution (SR) focuses on transforming real-world low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones, handling more complex degradation patterns than synthetic SR tasks. This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges group-theoretic network design with practical deployment constraints, providing a reproducible approach for optimizing equivariant models that maintains geometric robustness while achieving significant compression, making it particularly valuable for satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
  Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
  We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.

*Yuming Yang,Michael K. Ng,Zhigang Jia,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel quaternion-based blind deconvolution method for color images that preserves color channel relationships and improves deblurring performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind deconvolution methods for color images either convert to grayscale or process channels separately, ignoring important inter-channel relationships, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: Proposes a quaternion fidelity term using a quaternion convolution kernel with four components: one for overall blur and three for RGB channel interdependencies, with normalized quaternion kernel to preserve image intensity.

Result: Extensive experiments on real blurred color image datasets show effective artifact removal and significant improvement in deblurring effects compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The quaternion-based approach demonstrates strong potential as an effective tool for color image blind deconvolution by properly modeling color channel relationships.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenging problem of blind deconvolution for color images. Existing methods often convert color images to grayscale or process each color channel separately, which overlooking the relationships between color channels. To handle this issue, we formulate a novel quaternion fidelity term designed specifically for color image blind deconvolution. This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies. In order to preserve image intensity, we propose to use the normalized quaternion kernel in the blind deconvolution process. Extensive experiments on real datasets of blurred color images show that the proposed method effectively removes artifacts and significantly improves deblurring effect, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for color image deconvolution.

*Bulat Khaertdinov,Mirela Popa,Nava Tintarev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes relevance feedback mechanisms to improve visual search performance in vision-language models without requiring fine-tuning, including pseudo-relevance feedback, generative relevance feedback, and attentive feedback summarizer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve retrieval performance of vision-language models at inference time without requiring fine-tuning or scaling to larger models, inspired by traditional text-based search relevance feedback techniques.

Method: Four feedback strategies: classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), generative relevance feedback (GRF) using synthetic captions, attentive feedback summarizer (AFS) with custom transformer integrating multimodal features, and explicit feedback as upper-bound baseline using ground-truth captions.

Result: GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs and 1-3% for larger ones on Flickr30k and COCO datasets. AFS mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative retrieval settings.

Conclusion: Relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and enables interactive and adaptive visual search without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) enable intuitive visual search using natural language queries. However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.

TL;DR: MolSight is a three-stage learning framework for Optical Chemical Structure Recognition that addresses challenges in stereochemical information recognition through pre-training, multi-granularity fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OCSR systems struggle with accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to subtle visual cues like wedge/dash bonds and spatial arrangements, which is crucial for chemical data mining, drug discovery, and LLM applications.

Method: Three-stage training paradigm: 1) Pre-training on large-scale noisy datasets for fundamental perception, 2) Multi-granularity fine-tuning with auxiliary tasks (bond classification and atom localization), 3) Reinforcement learning optimization using GRPO algorithm and novel stereochemical dataset.

Result: MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in stereochemical optical structure recognition, with the compact model further enhanced by GRPO algorithm for stereomolecular recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed MolSight framework effectively addresses stereochemical recognition challenges in OCSR through its comprehensive three-stage learning approach and demonstrates superior performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) plays a pivotal role in modern chemical informatics, enabling the automated conversion of chemical structure images from scientific literature, patents, and educational materials into machine-readable molecular representations. This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets, our results demonstrate that MolSight achieves state-of-the-art performance in (stereo)chemical optical structure recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing finger pose estimation methods on portable devices rely solely on capacitive images, which are limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and have reduced accuracy for large-angle inputs (>45 degrees). There's a need for more comprehensive and accurate finger pose estimation to expand human-computer interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Finger pose offers promising opportunities to expand human computer interaction capability of touchscreen devices. Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority. Finally, we delineate the application space of finger pose with respect to enhancing authentication security and improving interactive experiences, and develop corresponding prototypes to showcase the interaction potential.

*Jiajie Guo,Qingpeng Zhu,Jin Zeng,Xiaolong Wu,Changyong He,Weida Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialGeo enhances MLLMs' spatial reasoning by combining CLIP's semantic features with geometry features through hierarchical fusion, improving accuracy in spatial tasks with reduced memory cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MLLMs have limited spatial reasoning ability due to lossy visual embeddings from CLIP that focus on instance-level semantics, lacking geometry awareness for 3D spatial arrangements.

Method: Proposed hierarchical fusion of CLIP semantic features and geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, trained with random feature dropping to avoid over-reliance on CLIP.

Result: Improves spatial reasoning accuracy by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench while reducing memory cost by approximately 50% during inference compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SpatialGeo effectively addresses spatial ambiguity in MLLMs through geometry-semantic fusion, demonstrating significant improvements in spatial reasoning capabilities with efficient memory usage.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in image and language tasks due to the strong reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like NoPe-NeRF that rely only on local image relationships struggle with accurate camera pose recovery in complex scenarios, creating a need for more robust pose estimation approaches.

Method: The approach uses relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by local joint optimization for pose refinement, and a global optimization phase with bundle adjustment incorporating geometric consistency constraints and feature trajectories.

Result: The method significantly improves initial pose quality and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis, demonstrating superior performance and robustness on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: NoPe-NeRF++ successfully combines local and global cues with NeRF, achieving better pose estimation and view synthesis quality than existing methods, particularly in challenging scenes.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce NoPe-NeRF++, a novel local-to-global optimization algorithm for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) without requiring pose priors. Existing methods, particularly NoPe-NeRF, which focus solely on the local relationships within images, often struggle to recover accurate camera poses in complex scenarios. To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF. Notably, our method is the first work that seamlessly combines the local and global cues with NeRF, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation accuracy and novel view synthesis. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance and robustness, even in challenging scenes, thus validating our design choices.

### [92] [Refracting Reality: Generating Images with Realistic Transparent Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17340)
*Yue Yin,Enze Tao,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of generating realistic transparent objects with accurate refraction in AI-generated images by synchronizing pixels using Snell's Law and recovering hidden surfaces through panoramic image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative image models perform poorly at synthesizing transparent objects because they fail to accurately model optical phenomena like refraction, reflection, absorption, and scattering. Refraction is particularly challenging as it creates constraints between pixel colors across the image.

Method: The approach synchronizes pixels within and outside object boundaries using Snell's Law of Refraction during the generation process. For surfaces not directly visible but seen through refraction/reflection, the method recovers their appearance by synchronizing with a second generated panorama image using the same warping and merging procedure.

Result: The proposed method generates optically-plausible images that respect physical constraints of refraction, significantly improving over standard generative models in rendering transparent objects.

Conclusion: By incorporating physical optics principles through pixel synchronization based on Snell's Law and panoramic recovery of hidden surfaces, the approach successfully generates transparent objects with accurate refraction that adhere to physical reality.

Abstract: Generative image models can produce convincingly real images, with plausible shapes, textures, layouts and lighting. However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure. We demonstrate that our approach generates much more optically-plausible images that respect the physical constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video painting tutorials lack interactivity and personalization, while current generative models struggle with cross-media generalization and temporal consistency in reproducing human creative workflows.

Method: Embed multiple media into diffusion models' conditional space with cross-medium style augmentation, using a reverse-painting training strategy to ensure smooth, human-aligned generation.

Result: Achieved strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics for cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity. Introduced Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve to quantitatively model human artistic progression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully generates multi-media painting processes with consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles, faithfully reproducing human creative workflows through quantitative modeling of artistic progression.

Abstract: Step-by-step painting tutorials are vital for learning artistic techniques, but existing video resources (e.g., YouTube) lack interactivity and personalization. While recent generative models have advanced artistic image synthesis, they struggle to generalize across media and often show temporal or structural inconsistencies, hindering faithful reproduction of human creative workflows. To address this, we propose a unified framework for multi-media painting process generation with a semantics-driven style control mechanism that embeds multiple media into a diffusion models conditional space and uses cross-medium style augmentation. This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation. We also build a large-scale dataset of real painting processes and evaluate cross-media consistency, temporal coherence, and final-image fidelity, achieving strong results on LPIPS, DINO, and CLIP metrics. Finally, our Perceptual Distance Profile (PDP) curve quantitatively models the creative sequence, i.e., composition, color blocking, and detail refinement, mirroring human artistic progression.

Motivation: To address the high cost and time consumption of acquiring large manually labeled datasets for skeleton-based action recognition by developing a more label-efficient approach.

Method: Proposes learning an acquisition function that scores the most informative subsets for labeling, optimized using an objective function combining data representativity, diversity, and uncertainty. Also extends this with an invertible GCN for mapping data to latent spaces where inherent data distribution is more easily captured.

Result: Extensive experiments on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and outperformance of the proposed label-frugal GCNs compared to related work.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the label efficiency problem in skeleton-based action recognition, achieving superior performance with fewer labeled samples through optimized subset selection and latent space mapping.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition is a hotspot in image processing. A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured. Extensive experiments, conducted on two challenging skeleton-based recognition datasets, show the effectiveness and the outperformance of our label-frugal GCNs against the related work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSeq-JEPA is a self-supervised learning method that combines JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning by identifying primary discriminative regions first and then predicting subsequent regions in order of importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current I-JEPA treats all image regions uniformly and independently, lacking selective attention and sequential processing inspired by human visual perception that moves from most informative to secondary regions.

Method: Uses transformer-derived saliency maps to identify primary discriminative regions first, then predicts subsequent regions in discriminative order, creating a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues.

Result: Outperforms I-JEPA variants across diverse tasks including image classification, fine-grained categorization, detection/segmentation, and low-level reasoning, focusing on more discriminative and generalizable representations.

Conclusion: DSeq-JEPA successfully bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, demonstrating that sequential reasoning with discriminative region ordering leads to superior visual representations compared to uniform region treatment.

Abstract: Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent embeddings of masked regions from visible context. However, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lacking an explicit notion of where or in what order predictions should be made. Inspired by human visual perception, which deploys attention selectively and sequentially from the most informative to secondary regions, we propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predictive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrating JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequential reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categorization (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detection and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demonstrate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more discriminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA variants.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level radiomics analysis, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cell classification (78% accuracy) and tumor segmentation (80% precision) on H&E images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell-level radiomics features offer fine-grained tumor insights but remain underexplored, with no dedicated backbone for radiomics data. Existing methods focus on slide/patch-level analysis, missing micro-level patterns that could enhance diagnostic accuracy and AI interpretability.

Method: Proposed Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone that flexibly combines Attention and Mamba modules in a single architecture, eliminating manual ratio tuning. Developed two UAM variants and extended to a multimodal framework for joint cell classification and image segmentation.

Result: UAM achieves 78% cell classification accuracy (vs 74% baseline) on 349,882 cells and 80% tumor segmentation precision (vs 75% baseline) on 406 patches, outperforming leading image-based foundation models on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: UAM demonstrates effectiveness as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis, highlighting the promise of cell-level radiomics analysis for enhanced tumor phenotyping and diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Cell-level radiomics features provide fine-grained insights into tumor phenotypes and have the potential to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches). These findings highlight the effectiveness and promise of UAM as a unified and extensible multimodal foundation for radiomics-driven cancer diagnosis.

*Seamie Hayes,Reenu Mohandas,Tim Brophy,Alexandre Boulch,Ganesh Sistu,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperQuadricOcc introduces a superquadric-based scene representation for semantic occupancy estimation in automated driving, achieving significant memory reduction (75%), faster inference (124% speedup), and improved performance (5.9% mIoU gain) compared to Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian representations for occupancy estimation require large numbers of primitives, leading to high memory requirements and slow inference unsuitable for real-time applications. Superquadrics offer reduced primitive counts but lack proper rasterization for model supervision.

Method: Uses superquadric-based scene representation with a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics to enable Gaussian rasterization for training supervision, without requiring temporal labels.

Result: Achieves 75% memory footprint reduction, 124% faster inference, 5.9% mIoU improvement on Occ3D dataset, and 84% reduction in primitive count compared to Gaussian-based methods. First occupancy model enabling real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: SuperQuadricOcc demonstrates that superquadric representations can significantly improve efficiency in semantic occupancy estimation for automated driving, enabling real-time inference with reduced memory requirements while maintaining or improving performance over Gaussian-based approaches.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on images, and existing test-time defense strategies have limited robustness while adversarial fine-tuning is too expensive.

Method: Operates directly in CLIP's embedding space, calculates augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer semantic recovery direction, and corrects embeddings based on angular consistency of latent drifts.

Result: Achieves remarkably high robustness across various benchmarks, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50% on average, with minimal computational overhead. Maintains robustness in extreme settings and against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: ATAC represents an efficient novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in CLIP's embedding space, demonstrating that simple embedding-space corrections can provide strong protection against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVRecon extends sparse voxel rasterization for high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Functions (SDF), addressing optimization challenges through geometric initialization and spatial smoothness constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse voxels are spatially disentangled with sharp boundaries, making them prone to local minima during optimization. While SDF provides smooth geometric fields, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is challenging.

Method: Integrates SDF into sparse voxel rasterization with two key components: (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model, and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups.

Result: Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show strong reconstruction accuracy with consistently speedy convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed SVRecon method achieves effective surface reconstruction by addressing the optimization challenges of sparse voxels through SDF integration and spatial coherence constraints, with promising performance and fast convergence.

Abstract: We extend the recently proposed sparse voxel rasterization paradigm to the task of high-fidelity surface reconstruction by integrating Signed Distance Function (SDF), named SVRecon. Unlike 3D Gaussians, sparse voxels are spatially disentangled from their neighbors and have sharp boundaries, which makes them prone to local minima during optimization. Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks show that our method achieves strong reconstruction accuracy while having consistently speedy convergence. The code will be made public.

### [100] [Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness: A Conservative Metric with Optimized Perturbation Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17380)
*Zheng Wang,Yi Zhang,Siddartha Khastgir,Carsten Maple,Xingyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Non-Parametric Probabilistic Robustness (NPPR), a practical robustness metric that learns perturbation distributions directly from data without predefined assumptions, addressing limitations of existing probabilistic robustness formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing probabilistic robustness (PR) formulations assume fixed and known perturbation distributions, which is unrealistic in practice. The authors aim to create a more practical PR metric that doesn't rely on predefined perturbation distributions.

Method: Proposed NPPR learns optimized perturbation distributions directly from data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across multiple architectures (ResNet18/50, WideResNet50, VGG16) show NPPR provides up to 40% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NPPR is validated as a more practical robustness metric that enables conservative probabilistic robustness evaluation under distributional uncertainty, overcoming the limitations of existing PR formulations that require predefined perturbation distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models, despite their remarkable success, remain vulnerable to small input perturbations that can cause erroneous outputs, motivating the recent proposal of probabilistic robustness (PR) as a complementary alternative to adversarial robustness (AR). However, existing PR formulations assume a fixed and known perturbation distribution, an unrealistic expectation in practice. To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution. Following the non-parametric paradigm in statistical modeling, NPPR learns an optimized perturbation distribution directly from data, enabling conservative PR evaluation under distributional uncertainty. We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.

*Runxun Zhang,Yizhou Liu,Li Dongrui,Bo XU,Jingwei Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphSeek is a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization framework for deformable image registration that reformulates the problem as spatially continuous optimization in latent feature space using stochastic Gaussian policies and multi-trajectory sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformable image registration faces challenges from high-dimensional deformation spaces and limited voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning approaches use coarse low-dimensional representations that cannot capture spatially variant deformations effectively.

Method: Proposes MorphSeek with stochastic Gaussian policy head on encoder to model latent feature distributions, enabling efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. Uses unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning via Group Relative Policy Optimization with multi-trajectory sampling.

Result: Achieves consistent Dice improvements across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, Abdomen MR-CT) while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead.

Conclusion: MorphSeek advances representation-level policy learning for spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, providing a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in medical image analysis, largely due to the prohibitively high-dimensional deformation space of dense displacement fields and the scarcity of voxel-level supervision. Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead. Beyond optimizer specifics, MorphSeek advances a representation-level policy learning paradigm that achieves spatially coherent and data-efficient deformation optimization, offering a principled, backbone-agnostic, and optimizer-agnostic solution for scalable visual alignment in high-dimensional settings.

*Huangbiao Xu,Huanqi Wu,Xiao Ke,Junyi Wu,Rui Xu,Jinglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCMoE is a multimodal action quality assessment framework that handles missing modalities by dynamically reconstructing them and using a mixture of experts to learn both unimodal and joint representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal AQA models fail when any modality is missing during inference, causing catastrophic performance degradation due to disrupted cross-modal interactions.

Method: Proposes an adaptive gated modality generator to reconstruct missing modalities, modality experts for unimodal knowledge, and dynamic mixing of expert knowledge for joint representations. Uses complete multimodal features to guide training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public AQA benchmarks in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MCMoE effectively addresses modality missing issues in multimodal AQA through unified unimodal and joint representation learning with mixture of experts.

Abstract: Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMT-ARD effectively enhances adversarial robustness of multimodal large models with improved scalability and efficiency, demonstrating the value of multi-teacher collaborative distillation approaches.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, making their adversarial robustness a crucial concern. While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of MMT-ARD in enhancing the adversarial robustness of multimodal large models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation networks trained on one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars, creating a need for domain adaptation methods that can bridge this performance gap across different lidar sensors.

Method: Leverages unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation using vision foundation models, focusing on backbone architecture optimization, single pretraining for multiple domains, and training MLP heads while keeping the pretrained backbone frozen.

Result: The proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging domain adaptation settings for lidar semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models can be effectively exploited for unsupervised domain adaptation in lidar point cloud segmentation through specific architectural choices and training strategies, enabling robust performance across different lidar domains.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation networks trained under full supervision for one type of lidar fail to generalize to unseen lidars without intervention. To reduce the performance gap under domain shifts, a recent trend is to leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) providing robust features across domains. In this work, we conduct an exhaustive study to identify recipes for exploiting VFMs in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of lidar point clouds. Building upon unsupervised image-to-lidar knowledge distillation, our study reveals that: (1) the architecture of the lidar backbone is key to maximize the generalization performance on a target domain; (2) it is possible to pretrain a single backbone once and for all, and use it to address many domain shifts; (3) best results are obtained by keeping the pretrained backbone frozen and training an MLP head for semantic segmentation. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results in four widely-recognized and challenging settings. The code will be available at: https://github.com/valeoai/muddos.

Abstract: When performing robot/vehicle localization using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to handle adverse weather and environmental conditions, existing techniques often struggle to accurately estimate distances when processing B-scan images with minor distinctions. This study introduces a new neural network-based odometry method that leverages the similarity and difference features of GPR B-scan images for precise estimation of the Euclidean distances traveled between the B-scan images. The new custom neural network extracts multi-scale features from B-scan images taken at consecutive moments and then determines the Euclidean distance traveled by analyzing the similarities and differences between these features. To evaluate our method, an ablation study and comparison experiments have been conducted using the publicly available CMU-GPR dataset. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts in all tests. Specifically, our method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE), and achieves an overall weighted RMSE of 0.449 m across all data sets, which is a 10.2\% reduction in RMSE when compared to the best state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: CWMDT transforms standard video diffusion models into counterfactual world models by creating digital twin representations, using LLMs for temporal reasoning about interventions, and conditioning video generation on modified representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models focus on factual forward simulation but lack the ability to answer counterfactual queries about hypothetical modifications, which is crucial for evaluating AI behavior under varying conditions.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Construct digital twins as structured text representations of objects and relationships, 2) Use LLMs to predict intervention propagation through time, 3) Condition video diffusion models with modified representations to generate counterfactual sequences.

Result: CWMDT achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, demonstrating that digital twin representations provide powerful control signals for video simulation-based world models.

Conclusion: Alternative representations like digital twins enable effective counterfactual reasoning in world models, offering enhanced capabilities for forward simulation and evaluation of hypothetical scenarios.

Abstract: World models learn to predict the temporal evolution of visual observations given a control signal, potentially enabling agents to reason about environments through forward simulation. Because of the focus on forward simulation, current world models generate predictions based on factual observations. For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as "what would happen if this object was removed?", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences. Evaluations on two benchmarks show that the CWMDT approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting that alternative representations of videos, such as the digital twins considered here, offer powerful control signals for video forward simulation-based world models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for radar modeling fail to represent arbitrary shapes or struggle with real-world radar signals collected over limited viewing angles, while optical 3D reconstruction methods don't work well when treating radar signals as camera views.

Method: Two-stage approach: first learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical shape feature resolutions, then diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on radar signal frequencies in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: Successfully reconstructs arbitrary 3D shapes from partially-observed radar signals and shows robust generalization to different simulation methods and real-world data.

Conclusion: Radar2Shape enables effective 3D reconstruction from radar signals and the authors release synthetic benchmark datasets to advance research in high-frequency radar domain for safe adaptation to real-world systems.

Abstract: Determining the shape of 3D objects from high-frequency radar signals is analytically complex but critical for commercial and aerospace applications. Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data. Additionally, we release two synthetic benchmark datasets to encourage future research in the high-frequency radar domain so that models like Radar2Shape can safely be adapted into real-world radar systems.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning method to estimate spine age from MRI images and introduces the spine age gap (SAG) as a biomarker for spine health, showing associations with degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The human spine is vulnerable to age-related degeneration that can be identified through MRI. There's a need for automated methods to assess spine health and understand how degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors affect spinal aging.

Method: Used computer vision and deep learning on over 18,000 MRI series. Applied UMAP and HDBSCAN clustering to identify age-based clusters of degenerative conditions. Conducted ablation studies on data size, loss functions, and spine regions. Calculated spine age gap (SAG) as the difference between actual and predicted age.

Result: The model successfully estimated spine age from MRI images. SAG was found to be associated with various spine degenerative conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work.

Conclusion: The spine age gap (SAG) may serve as a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health, as it captures the cumulative effects of degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors on spinal aging.

Abstract: The human spine is a complex structure composed of 33 vertebrae. It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical demands require smaller, efficient multimodal systems, but scaling down LLMs disproportionately affects visual capabilities rather than inherited LLM abilities.

Method: Introduces Extract+Think approach with visual extraction tuning (training models to extract instruction-relevant visual details) and step-by-step reasoning to generate answers.

Result: LLM downscaling causes sharp performance drops in both visual perception and reasoning, with perception impact often matching or exceeding reasoning impact. The Extract+Think approach sets new standards for efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: Visual extraction tuning combined with step-by-step reasoning effectively addresses the bottleneck caused by LLM downscaling, enabling efficient multimodal models without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Scaling up multimodal models has enabled remarkable advances in visual understanding and reasoning, but practical demands call for smaller, efficient systems. In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers. Together, these components form our Extract+Think approach, setting a new standard for efficiency and performance in this space.

TL;DR: Video-R4 introduces visual rumination - an iterative process of frame selection, zooming, and re-encoding to improve reasoning in text-rich videos, achieving SOTA results on M4-ViteVQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video QA models fail on fine-grained evidence in text-rich videos because they use single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and missed transient textual cues.

Method: A multi-stage learning framework that finetunes a 7B LMM to perform visual rumination through supervised practice (Video-R4-CoT-17k) and reinforcement learning (Video-R4-RL-30k), learning atomic and mixing visual operations.

Result: Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and generalizes well to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA tasks.

Conclusion: Iterative visual rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning that mimics human-like inspection behaviors like pausing, zooming, and re-reading critical regions.

Abstract: Understanding text-rich videos requires reading small, transient textual cues that often demand repeated inspection. Yet most video QA models rely on single-pass perception over fixed frames, leading to hallucinations and failures on fine-grained evidence. Inspired by how humans pause, zoom, and re-read critical regions, we introduce Video-R4 (Reinforcing Text-Rich Video Reasoning with Visual Rumination), a video reasoning LMM that performs visual rumination: iteratively selecting frames, zooming into informative regions, re-encoding retrieved pixels, and updating its reasoning state. We construct two datasets with executable rumination trajectories: Video-R4-CoT-17k for supervised practice and Video-R4-RL-30k for reinforcement learning. We propose a multi-stage rumination learning framework that progressively finetunes a 7B LMM to learn atomic and mixing visual operations via SFT and GRPO-based RL. Video-R4-7B achieves state-of-the-art results on M4-ViteVQA and further generalizes to multi-page document QA, slides QA, and generic video QA, demonstrating that iterative rumination is an effective paradigm for pixel-grounded multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: EvDiff is a diffusion model that generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams using a single forward diffusion step and surrogate training framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-to-image reconstruction methods produce perceptually inferior results and struggle with scaling model capacity and training data due to the ill-posed nature of recovering absolute brightness from sparse event data.

Method: Proposes EvDiff with a temporally consistent EvEncoder that performs only one forward diffusion step to reduce computational cost, and uses a Surrogate Training Framework to eliminate dependence on paired event-image datasets by leveraging large-scale image datasets.

Result: Generates high-quality colorful videos from monochromatic event streams, achieving superior performance on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics compared to existing approaches on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: EvDiff strikes an optimal balance between fidelity and realism in event-based video reconstruction, outperforming current methods while being computationally efficient and scalable.

Abstract: As neuromorphic sensors, event cameras asynchronously record changes in brightness as streams of sparse events with the advantages of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Reconstructing intensity images from events is a highly ill-posed task due to the inherent ambiguity of absolute brightness. Early methods generally follow an end-to-end regression paradigm, directly mapping events to intensity frames in a deterministic manner. While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity. The proposed EvDiff is capable of generating high-quality colorful videos solely from monochromatic event streams. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method strikes a sweet spot between fidelity and realism, outperforming existing approaches on both pixel-level and perceptual metrics.

TL;DR: SPI introduces a multi-resolution vector indexing framework with query-adaptive resolution control for RAG systems, achieving significant speedup and memory efficiency gains while improving retrieval quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vector database retrieval pipelines use flat or single-resolution indexing that cannot adapt to varying semantic granularity needed by diverse queries, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and relevance.

Method: SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and uses a lightweight classifier to dynamically select optimal resolution level per query, enabling progressive coarse-to-fine retrieval.

Result: SPI achieves up to 5.7× retrieval speedup, 1.8× memory efficiency gain, and improves QA F1 scores by up to 2.5 points across multiple benchmarks including MS MARCO and Natural Questions.

Conclusion: SPI provides an effective multi-resolution indexing framework that significantly accelerates retrieval while maintaining semantic coverage, with theoretical guarantees and compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance.
  To address this, we propose \textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage.
  We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \textbf{5.7$\times$} retrieval speedup and \textbf{1.8$\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

### [114] [Bench360: Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16682)
*Linus Stuhlmann,Mauricio Fadel Argerich,Jonathan Fürst*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bench360 is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for local LLM inference that evaluates models, inference engines, and quantization levels across multiple usage scenarios while tracking both system metrics and task-specific performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users face overwhelming configuration choices when running LLMs locally, with existing benchmarks being too narrow and not user-focused, failing to integrate system and task metrics into a unified easy-to-use solution.

Method: Bench360 allows users to define custom tasks with datasets and metrics, then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server), tracking computing performance, resource usage, deployment metrics, and task-specific metrics.

Result: Evaluation on four common LLM tasks across three hardware platforms and four inference engines revealed interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, with no single best setup for local inference.

Conclusion: There is no single optimal configuration for local LLM inference, strongly motivating the need for comprehensive benchmarking frameworks like Bench360 to help users make informed decisions based on their specific requirements.

Abstract: Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.

### [115] [How Well Do LLMs Understand Tunisian Arabic?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16683)
*Mohamed Mahdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates LLMs' performance on Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi) through transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis tasks using a novel parallel dataset, revealing significant gaps in low-resource language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial LLMs often neglect low-resource languages like Tunisian Arabic, risking exclusion of millions from AI interaction in their native language and threatening dialect preservation while pushing users toward foreign languages.

Method: Created a novel dataset with parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations with sentiment labels, then benchmarked several popular LLMs on transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis tasks.

Result: Results revealed significant performance differences between models, highlighting both strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects, with clear gaps in low-resource language capabilities.

Conclusion: The study underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in next-generation AI systems to ensure technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded for all linguistic communities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are the engines driving today's AI agents. The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.

### [116] [Ellipsoid-Based Decision Boundaries for Open Intent Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16685)
*Yuetian Zou,Hanlei Zhang,Hua Xu,Songze Li,Long Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EliDecide is a novel method for open intent classification that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions, outperforming existing spherical boundary approaches on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive decision boundary methods assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning for discriminative features, learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoid boundaries, and optimizes via a dual loss function balancing empirical and open-space risks by expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting against synthesized pseudo-open samples.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and a question classification dataset, demonstrating superior open intent detection capability.

Conclusion: The flexibility of ellipsoid boundaries shows strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Textual open intent classification is crucial for real-world dialogue systems, enabling robust detection of unknown user intents without prior knowledge and contributing to the robustness of the system. While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.

*Giulio Antonio Abbo,Tony Belpaeme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a model-agnostic method to evaluate prompt effectiveness in steering LLM responses toward specific human values, using Schwartz's theory and showing value steering is possible without model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning approaches for aligning LLMs with human values are static and don't adapt to dynamic everyday situations involving changing values and preferences.

Method: Developed a practical, reproducible procedure to evaluate prompt candidates' effectiveness in steering generated text toward specific human values, formalizing a scoring method to quantify target value presence and gain. Applied to Wizard-Vicuna model using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and structured dialogue dataset evaluation.

Result: Compared baseline prompt to value-conditioned prompt and demonstrated that value steering is possible without model alteration or dynamic prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Value steering in LLMs can be achieved through effective prompting strategies without requiring model fine-tuning or dynamic optimization, providing a practical approach for aligning model outputs with human values.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in applications where alignment with human values is critical. While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.

### [118] [Concept-Based Interpretability for Toxicity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16689)
*Samarth Garg,Deeksha Varshney,Divya Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Gradient (CG) method for toxicity detection, uses targeted lexicon sets to identify misclassification causes, and proposes lexicon-free augmentation to test model attribution patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current toxicity detection lacks concept-based explanations, and disproportionate concept attribution causes classification errors. The goal is to provide more causal interpretations of model decisions.

Method: Leverages toxicity subtype attributes as concepts, introduces Concept Gradient method for causal interpretation, creates Targeted Lexicon Sets to identify misclassification causes, computes Word-Concept Alignment scores, and uses lexicon-free augmentation to test attribution patterns.

Result: The approach provides more interpretable toxicity detection by measuring how concept changes affect model outputs, identifies specific toxic words causing misclassifications, and reveals whether models rely on lexical patterns or broader toxic language understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers improved interpretability in toxicity detection by addressing concept over-attribution issues and provides insights into model decision-making processes beyond simple lexical matching.

Abstract: The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.

### [119] [Falsely Accused: How AI Detectors Misjudge Slightly Polished Arabic Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690)
*Saleh Almohaimeed,Saad Almohaimeed,Mousa Jari,Khaled A. Alobaid,Fahad Alotaibi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI detectors misclassify slightly polished human-written Arabic articles as AI-generated, with performance dropping significantly - from 92% to 12% accuracy for commercial detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem where AI detectors falsely classify human-authored articles that have been slightly polished by AI as AI-generated, potentially leading to false plagiarism accusations and undermining detector credibility.

Method: Created two Arabic datasets: one with 800 articles (half AI/half human) to evaluate 14 LLMs and commercial detectors, and another with 400 human articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 settings (16,400 samples) to test how slight polishing affects detection accuracy.

Result: All AI detectors incorrectly attributed significant numbers of polished human articles to AI. Claude-4 Sonnet dropped from 83.51% to 57.63% accuracy, while originality.AI dropped from 92% to 12% accuracy for articles polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

Conclusion: Slight AI polishing of human-written Arabic text causes significant misclassification by AI detectors, severely compromising their reliability and highlighting a critical vulnerability in current detection systems.

Abstract: Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.

*Boyang Zhou,Johan Lindqvist,Lindsey Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reproduction study confirms test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly improves language model performance across various model sizes and domains, with largest gains on structured datasets and for models not pretrained on similar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate and reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models, while addressing practical implementation challenges and extending evaluation to modern architectures.

Method: Used pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss to retrieve 20 neighbors per test input, applied one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B models, with memory-efficient retrieval implementation.

Result: Test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with largest improvements on structured datasets like GitHub and EuroParl. Models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more, allowing smaller models to approach larger model performance.

Conclusion: Results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training, with consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures, while highlighting practical considerations for large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

Abstract: We reproduce the central claims of Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models (Hardt and Sun, 2024), which proposes adapting a language model at inference time by fine-tuning on retrieved nearest-neighbor sequences. Using pretrained RoBERTa embeddings indexed with Faiss, we retrieve 20 neighbors per test input and apply one gradient update per neighbor across GPT-2 (117M, 774M), GPT-Neo (1.3B), and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B. Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones. Due to infrastructure limitations, we introduce a memory-efficient retrieval implementation that loads only required line offsets rather than entire files, reducing RAM requirements from over 128 GB per server to 32 GB. We also extend the original study by evaluating R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-1.5B, showing that test-time training yields consistent gains even for modern reasoning-optimized architectures. Overall, our results support the robustness and generality of nearest-neighbor test-time training while highlighting practical considerations for reproducing large-scale retrieval-augmented adaptation.

*JaeSeong Kim,Suan Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multilingual LLMs sharply separate language information in the first transformer layer and maintain linear separability throughout the model, with language alignment strongly influenced by training data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how language information is structured in multilingual LLMs' internal representations and how it emerges across layers, as this has been limited in previous research.

Method: Comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear/nonlinear probes and Token-Language Alignment analysis to quantify layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding.

Result: Language information becomes sharply separated in first transformer block (+76.4±8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains linearly separable. Chinese-inclusive models achieve 16.43% ZH Match@Peak vs 3.90% for English-centric models, showing 4.21× structural imprinting effect.

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs distinguish languages by latent representational structures shaped by training corpus rather than surface script features, providing insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs demonstrate strong performance across diverse languages, yet there has been limited systematic analysis of how language information is structured within their internal representation space and how it emerges across layers. We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\%, revealing a 4.21$\times$ structural imprinting effect. These findings indicate that multilingual LLMs distinguish languages not by surface script features but by latent representational structures shaped by the training corpus. Our analysis provides practical insights for data composition strategies and fairness in multilingual representation learning.

*Jonathon Dilworth,Hui Yang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a language model-based ontology embedding approach for hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT, specifically addressing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) queries that have no direct matches in the ontology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, and polysemies, especially when queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with no equivalent matches in the ontology.

Method: The approach uses language model-based ontology embeddings to handle OOV queries and retrieve hierarchical concepts from SNOMED CT, including direct subsumers and less relevant ancestors.

Result: The method outperforms baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods on constructed OOV query datasets annotated against SNOMED CT concepts.

Conclusion: While evaluated specifically on SNOMED CT, the approach is generalizable and can be extended to other ontologies. Code, tools, and evaluation datasets are publicly released.

Abstract: SNOMED CT is a biomedical ontology with a hierarchical representation of large-scale concepts. Knowledge retrieval in SNOMED CT is critical for its application, but often proves challenging due to language ambiguity, synonyms, polysemies and so on. This problem is exacerbated when the queries are out-of-vocabulary (OOV), i.e., having no equivalent matchings in the ontology. In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors. We find that our method outperforms the baselines including SBERT and two lexical matching methods. While evaluated against SNOMED CT, the approach is generalisable and can be extended to other ontologies. We release code, tools, and evaluation datasets at https://github.com/jonathondilworth/HR-OOV.

### [123] [Detecting and Steering LLMs' Empathy in Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16699)
*Juan P. Cadile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Empathy-in-action in LLMs can be detected and steered as a linear direction in activation space, with detection being highly accurate across models but steering effectiveness varying significantly by model architecture and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether empathy-in-action (willingness to sacrifice task efficiency for human needs) can be detected and controlled as a linear direction in LLM activation space, and understand how this capability varies across different model architectures and training approaches.

Method: Used contrastive prompts from the Empathy-in-Action benchmark to test detection and steering across three models: Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored). Detection was measured via AUROC scores, while steering was tested through bidirectional interventions.

Result: Detection achieved near-perfect AUROC (0.996-1.00) across all models. Steering success varied: Qwen (65.3%), Phi-3 (61.7%), while Dolphin showed asymmetric performance (94.4% pro-empathy success but catastrophic failure for anti-empathy). Cross-model probe agreement was limited, indicating architecture-specific implementations.

Conclusion: Empathy encoding emerges independently of safety training, but steering robustness varies significantly by model. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though more validation across models is needed.

Abstract: We investigate empathy-in-action -- the willingness to sacrifice task efficiency to address human needs -- as a linear direction in LLM activation space. Using contrastive prompts grounded in the Empathy-in-Action (EIA) benchmark, we test detection and steering across Phi-3-mini-4k (3.8B), Qwen2.5-7B (safety-trained), and Dolphin-Llama-3.1-8B (uncensored).
  Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection.
  Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts).
  Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement. Safety training may affect steering robustness rather than preventing manipulation, though validation across more models is needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective system for generating code from Bangla instructions that can handle errors and improve through iterative debugging.

Method: Multi-agent pipeline: code generation agent creates initial solution, then debugger agent processes only failing test cases by analyzing error traces and generating revised solutions.

Result: Achieved first place in BLP-2025 Shared Task with 95.4% Pass@1 score.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach with selective debugging on failing cases is highly effective for code generation from natural language instructions.

Abstract: This paper presents JGU Mainz's winning system for the BLP-2025 Shared Task on Code Generation from Bangla Instructions. We propose a multi-agent-based pipeline. First, a code-generation agent produces an initial solution from the input instruction. The candidate program is then executed against the provided unit tests (pytest-style, assert-based). Only the failing cases are forwarded to a debugger agent, which reruns the tests, extracts error traces, and, conditioning on the error messages, the current program, and the relevant test cases, generates a revised solution. Using this approach, our submission achieved first place in the shared task with a $Pass@1$ score of 95.4. We also make our code public.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a non-representational ABC framework for translation, viewing it as an enacted activity integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes through brain-body-environment interactions rather than static mental representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge representation-based models of the mind by offering an alternative grounded in Extended Mind theory and radical enactivism, reframing translation as dynamic, embodied participation rather than symbolic manipulation.

Method: Develops a novel ABC framework combining Extended Mind theory, radical enactivism, Predictive Processing, and Active Inference to conceptualize translation as enacted activity emerging from brain-body-environment loops.

Result: Presents translation as skillful sociocultural practice where meaning is co-created in real-time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts, rather than through static interlingual correspondences.

Conclusion: Translation should be understood as an emergent, non-representational process where the translator's mind dynamically integrates ABC processes through embodied participation in sociocultural practices, fundamentally reframing our understanding of mental processes in translation.

Abstract: Building on the Extended Mind (EM) theory and radical enactivism, this article suggests an alternative to representation-based models of the mind. We lay out a novel ABC framework of the translating mind, in which translation is not the manipulation of static interlingual correspondences but an enacted activity, dynamically integrating affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) processes. Drawing on Predictive Processing and (En)Active Inference, we argue that the translator's mind emerges, rather than being merely extended, through loops of brain-body-environment interactions. This non-representational account reframes translation as skillful participation in sociocultural practice, where meaning is co-created in real time through embodied interaction with texts, tools, and contexts.

### [126] [Interpretable dimensions support an effect of agentivity and telicity on split intransitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16824)
*Eva Neu,Brian Dillon,Katrin Erk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits the relationship between intransitive verb classes (unergatives vs. unaccusatives) and semantic properties (agentivity vs. telicity), using interpretable dimensions from seed words to address limitations in human rating tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the recent finding by Kim et al. (2024) that human ratings for agentivity and telicity poorly predict the syntactic behavior of intransitive verbs, and to provide better evidence for the semantic-syntactic link.

Method: Using interpretable dimensions computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales, in conjunction with human judgments.

Result: The findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, demonstrating that interpretable dimensions can reveal semantic properties not easily captured in rating tasks.

Conclusion: Using interpretable dimensions with human judgments offers valuable evidence for semantic properties that are difficult to evaluate through rating tasks alone, confirming the semantic-syntactic relationship in intransitive verb classification.

Abstract: Intransitive verbs fall into two different syntactic classes, unergatives and unaccusatives. It has long been argued that verbs describing an agentive action are more likely to appear in an unergative syntax, and those describing a telic event to appear in an unaccusative syntax. However, recent work by Kim et al. (2024) found that human ratings for agentivity and telicity were a poor predictor of the syntactic behavior of intransitives. Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.

### [127] [PEPPER: Perception-Guided Perturbation for Robust Backdoor Defense in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16830)
*Oscar Chew,Po-Yi Lu,Jayden Lin,Kuan-Hao Huang,Hsuan-Tien Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEPPER is a backdoor defense method for text-to-image diffusion models that rewrites input captions to disrupt embedded triggers while maintaining visual similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where triggers in input prompts can steer generation toward harmful content, requiring effective defense mechanisms.

Method: PEPPER rewrites captions into semantically distant but visually similar versions while adding unobstructive elements to disrupt embedded triggers and dilute trigger token influence.

Result: Experiments show PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality, and can be paired with existing defenses for stronger robustness.

Conclusion: PEPPER provides enhanced robustness against backdoor attacks in text-to-image diffusion models and can be combined with other defenses for generalizable protection.

Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.

*Seyed Mohssen Ghafari,Ronny Kol,Juan C. Quiroz,Nella Luan,Monika Patial,Chanaka Rupasinghe,Herman Wandabwa,Luiz Pizzato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel reference-free metric for evaluating LLM response conciseness that uses three compression-based calculations without requiring human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate verbose responses with redundant details, reducing clarity, user satisfaction, and increasing costs for developers using token-based pricing models.

Method: Quantifies non-essential content using three calculations: 1) compression ratio between original response and LLM abstractive summary, 2) compression ratio between original response and LLM extractive summary, and 3) word-removal compression where an LLM removes non-essential words while preserving meaning.

Result: Experimental results show the metric effectively identifies redundancy in LLM outputs and provides a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity.

Conclusion: The proposed reference-free metric offers an effective automated approach for evaluating LLM response conciseness without requiring ground truth human annotations, addressing verbosity issues in conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate responses that are lengthy and verbose, filled with redundant or unnecessary details. This diminishes clarity and user satisfaction, and it increases costs for model developers, especially with well-known proprietary models that charge based on the number of output tokens. In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.

### [129] [Improving Latent Reasoning in LLMs via Soft Concept Mixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16885)
*Kang Wang,Xiangyu Duan,Tianyi Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Soft Concept Mixing (SCM) is a training method that bridges the gap between LLMs' discrete token training and soft concept reasoning by mixing soft concept vectors into hidden states and optimizing with RL, improving reasoning performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs reason with discrete tokens which limits expressive power compared to human abstract reasoning. There's a gap between soft concepts in reasoning and discrete tokens in training that needs to be addressed.

Method: SCM constructs soft concept vectors as probability-weighted averages of embeddings, mixes them into model's hidden states, and optimizes the entire latent reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks show improved reasoning performance of LLMs while maintaining stable training dynamics.

Conclusion: SCM effectively bridges the training-reasoning gap by exposing models to soft representations during training, enhancing reasoning capabilities while preserving training stability.

Abstract: Unlike human reasoning in abstract conceptual spaces, large language models (LLMs) typically reason by generating discrete tokens, which potentially limit their expressive power. The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of small, looped architectures like TRMs that outperform LLMs on complex reasoning tasks, with minimal changes to the existing methods.

Method: Framed latent reasoning of TRMs as classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement, then proposed a training scheme providing targets for each loop during training, eliminating halting mechanisms.

Result: Significantly enhanced training efficiency: 18x reduction in forward passes, maintained comparable quality to standard TRMs, achieved 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed training scheme substantially improves TRM efficiency while preserving performance, demonstrating superior results over most LLMs on complex reasoning tasks with minimal parameter requirements.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that small, looped architectures, such as Tiny Recursive Models (TRMs), can outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, including the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we investigate a core question: how can we further improve the efficiency of these methods with minimal changes? To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.

TL;DR: The study investigates how statistical properties of training data affect induction head formation in language models, finding that bigram repetition frequency and reliability are key factors, with specific thresholds and dependencies identified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise relationship between training data statistics and the formation of induction heads, which are crucial for in-context learning capabilities in language models.

Method: Analyzed the relationship between statistical properties of training data (both natural and synthetic) and induction head formation, examining factors like batch size, context size, bigram repetition frequency and reliability.

Result: Found that: (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts IH formation point; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect IH formation with a precise Pareto frontier; (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency/reliability is sufficient, but with low values, categoriality and marginal distribution shape matter.

Conclusion: Statistical properties of training data, particularly bigram repetition frequency and reliability, play a crucial role in induction head formation, with specific thresholds and dependencies that determine when these specialized attention heads develop.

Abstract: Arguably, specialized attention heads dubbed induction heads (IHs) underlie the remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of modern language models (LMs); yet, a precise characterization of their formation remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the relationship between statistical properties of training data (for both natural and synthetic data) and IH formation. We show that (1) a simple equation combining batch size and context size predicts the point at which IHs form; (2) surface bigram repetition frequency and reliability strongly affect the formation of IHs, and we find a precise Pareto frontier in terms of these two values; and (3) local dependency with high bigram repetition frequency and reliability is sufficient for IH formation, but when the frequency and reliability are low, categoriality and the shape of the marginal distribution matter.

TL;DR: Proposes ARQUSUMM framework for argument-aware quantitative summarization of online conversations, identifying claim-reason structures and measuring argument strength using LLM few-shot learning and clustering algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing summarization methods overlook the argumentative nature of online conversations and fail to capture deeper argument structures within sentences, making it difficult to understand the rationale and justification behind arguments in controversial discussions.

Method: Uses LLM few-shot learning grounded in argumentation theory to identify propositions and claim-reason relationships within sentences, then employs argument structure-aware clustering to aggregate arguments and quantify their support.

Result: ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models, generating summaries with better argument structure representation, higher textual quality, and improved quantification accuracy that are more helpful to users.

Conclusion: The proposed argument-aware quantitative summarization approach effectively captures the claim-reason structure of arguments in online conversations and provides quantitative measures of argument strength, offering more comprehensive and useful summaries for controversial discussions.

Abstract: Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.

*Junjie Hao,Chun Wang,Ying Qiao,Qiuyue Zuo,Qiya Song,Hua Ma,Xieping Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach to enhance domain-specific information extraction for Hunan's historical celebrities using large language models, achieving significant performance improvements in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities and the underperformance of general-purpose models in low-resource settings for domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation.

Method: Design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain, build an instruction-tuning dataset, and apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).

Result: All models exhibited substantial performance gains after fine-tuning, with Qwen3-8B achieving the strongest results (score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations).

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

Abstract: Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.

### [134] [Do Vision-Language Models Understand Visual Persuasiveness?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17036)
*Gyuwon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether vision-language models (VLMs) truly understand visual persuasion by creating a dataset for persuasiveness judgment and introducing Visual Persuasive Factors taxonomy. The study reveals VLMs have recall-oriented bias, weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features, and that high-level semantic alignment is the strongest predictor of human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether current vision-language models actually grasp how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions, as their understanding of visual persuasion remains unclear despite advances in multi-modal reasoning.

Method: Constructed a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment, introduced Visual Persuasive Factors taxonomy (low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, high-level semantic cues), and explored cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning across various VLMs.

Result: VLMs exhibit recall-oriented bias (over-predicting high persuasiveness) and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. High-level semantic alignment between message and object presence is the strongest predictor of human judgment. Simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal/negative effects, while concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores.

Conclusion: VLMs' core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent, suggesting the need for better integration of visual elements with persuasive messaging goals.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multi-modal reasoning and understanding. Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnalyticScore, an interpretable automated scoring framework for short answers that implements four interpretability principles (FGTI) and achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is increasing demand for transparent and interpretable automated scoring systems in large-scale assessments, but no widely accepted solution exists yet.

Method: Developed AnalyticScore framework with three steps: (1) extract identifiable response elements, (2) featurize responses using LLMs into human-interpretable values, (3) apply ordinal logistic regression for scoring.

Result: AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable methods and is within 0.06 QWK of uninterpretable SOTA on ASAP-SAS dataset. Its featurization behavior aligns well with human annotators.

Conclusion: The proposed FGTI principles and AnalyticScore framework demonstrate that interpretable automated scoring is feasible and can achieve competitive performance while maintaining transparency.

Abstract: AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.

TL;DR: MUCH is the first claim-level uncertainty quantification benchmark for LLMs, featuring 4,873 samples across four languages and four LLMs, with released generation logits and a fast deterministic segmentation algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliability in Large Language Models by providing a fair and reproducible evaluation framework for claim-level uncertainty quantification methods under realistic deployment conditions.

Method: Created a benchmark with 4,873 samples across English, French, Spanish, and German using four instruction-tuned LLMs, released 24 generation logits per token, and developed a deterministic segmentation algorithm that uses only 0.2% of LLM generation time.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of UQ methods under realistic constraints, and current evaluations show substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency of existing methods.

Conclusion: MUCH provides a comprehensive benchmark for claim-level uncertainty quantification that supports both black-box and white-box methods, with efficient segmentation suitable for real-time monitoring, highlighting the need for further development in UQ techniques.

Abstract: Claim-level Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to mitigate the lack of reliability in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce MUCH, the first claim-level UQ benchmark designed for fair and reproducible evaluation of future methods under realistic conditions. It includes 4,873 samples across four European languages (English, French, Spanish, and German) and four instruction-tuned open-weight LLMs. Unlike prior claim-level benchmarks, we release 24 generation logits per token, facilitating the development of future white-box methods without re-generating data. Moreover, in contrast to previous benchmarks that rely on manual or LLM-based segmentation, we propose a new deterministic algorithm capable of segmenting claims using as little as 0.2% of the LLM generation time. This makes our segmentation approach suitable for real-time monitoring of LLM outputs, ensuring that MUCH evaluates UQ methods under realistic deployment constraints. Finally, our evaluations show that current methods still have substantial room for improvement in both performance and efficiency.

Motivation: To demonstrate AMD hardware's maturity for competitive large-scale pretraining and provide practical guidance for systems and model design on AMD infrastructure.

Method: Comprehensive cluster and networking characterization on Pollara interconnect, MI300X microbenchmarks, MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules, and training of ZAYA1 MoE model (760M active, 8.3B total parameters).

Result: ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B, outperforming Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks.

Conclusion: AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining, with demonstrated competitive model performance.

Abstract: We report on the first large-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) pretraining study on pure AMD hardware, utilizing both MI300X GPUs with Pollara interconnect. We distill practical guidance for both systems and model design. On the systems side, we deliver a comprehensive cluster and networking characterization: microbenchmarks for all core collectives (all-reduce, reduce-scatter, all-gather, broadcast) across message sizes and GPU counts on Pollara. To our knowledge, this is the first at this scale. We further provide MI300X microbenchmarks on kernel sizing and memory bandwidth to inform model design. On the modeling side, we introduce and apply MI300X-aware transformer sizing rules for attention and MLP blocks and justify MoE widths that jointly optimize training throughput and inference latency. We describe our training stack in depth, including often-ignored utilities such as fault-tolerance and checkpoint-reshaping, as well as detailed information on our training recipe. We also provide a preview of our model architecture and base model - ZAYA1 (760M active, 8.3B total parameters MoE) - which will be further improved upon in forthcoming papers. ZAYA1-base achieves performance comparable to leading base models such as Qwen3-4B and Gemma3-12B at its scale and larger, and outperforms models including Llama-3-8B and OLMoE across reasoning, mathematics, and coding benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that the AMD hardware, network, and software stack are mature and optimized enough for competitive large-scale pretraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM2Comp uses context compression as a pretext task to adapt LLMs for text representation, outperforming token-level methods like masked next-token prediction while being more data-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are suboptimal for text representation due to their causal nature and next-token prediction optimization. Existing adaptation methods rely on token-level objectives that may not produce holistic representations effectively.

Method: Proposes context compression as a pretext task where the model learns to generate compact memory tokens that substitute the entire context for downstream sequence prediction. Combines this with contrastive learning for further improvements.

Result: LLM2Comp significantly outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders across various tasks and demonstrates superior sample efficiency, requiring substantially less training data than existing methods.

Conclusion: Context compression is an effective pretext task for adapting LLMs to text representation, producing better representations than token-level objectives while being more data-efficient.

Abstract: Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets for automatic post-editing of NMT outputs, which has hindered development of effective APE systems despite advances in neural machine translation.

Method: Created LangMark - a human-annotated multilingual APE dataset with 206,983 triplets (source, NMT output, human post-edit) for English to 7 languages, annotated by expert linguists. Used this dataset to evaluate LLMs with few-shot prompting for APE tasks.

Result: Large Language Models with few-shot prompting can effectively perform automatic post-editing, improving upon leading commercial and proprietary machine translation systems when using the LangMark dataset.

Conclusion: The LangMark dataset facilitates future development and evaluation of APE systems, demonstrating that LLMs can effectively perform automatic post-editing to enhance translation quality.

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to correct errors in machine-translated text, enhancing translation quality, while reducing the need for human intervention. Despite advances in neural machine translation (NMT), the development of effective APE systems has been hindered by the lack of large-scale multilingual datasets specifically tailored to NMT outputs. To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems. We believe that this new resource will facilitate the future development and evaluation of APE systems.

TL;DR: ABCA is a causal inference framework that enables early abstention in LLMs by analyzing internal knowledge diversity across different aspects, preventing unreliable responses before generation rather than after.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing abstention methods rely on post-generation signals, limiting their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. LLMs often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses (hallucinations), and current approaches can't effectively stop this before generation.

Method: ABCA uses aspect-based causal abstention to analyze internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. It identifies knowledge diversity across aspects like disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames, and estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess knowledge reliability.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances interpretability of abstention decisions by identifying two types: Type-1 (knowledge conflict) and Type-2 (knowledge insufficiency).

Conclusion: ABCA provides an effective framework for early abstention in LLMs by leveraging causal inference on internal knowledge diversity, outperforming existing methods and offering interpretable abstention decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don't know", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.

### [142] [Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) Model for Integrating Statistical and Semantic Features in News Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17184)
*Mohammad Zare*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features for news text classification, using attention mechanisms to dynamically weight feature importance and achieving superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional statistical methods fail to capture contextual meaning, while modern deep learning approaches may overlook important statistical indicators. There's a need to leverage both feature types for better classification accuracy.

Method: The AGFF model integrates statistical features (like TF-IDF) and semantic features in a unified framework with attention-based mechanisms to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type.

Result: Evaluation on benchmark news datasets shows superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models, with ablation studies validating each component's contribution.

Conclusion: Strategic integration of diverse feature types significantly enhances classification accuracy, and the model effectively balances complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations for practical news classification.

Abstract: News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.

### [143] [AutoLink: Autonomous Schema Exploration and Expansion for Scalable Schema Linking in Text-to-SQL at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17190)
*Ziyang Wang,Yuanlei Zheng,Zhenbiao Cao,Xiaojin Zhang,Zhongyu Wei,Pei Fu,Zhenbo Luo,Wei Chen,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLink is an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative process to address scalability and cost issues in industrial text-to-SQL systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance on large databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing schema linking methods for text-to-SQL are impractical for industrial-scale applications due to context window limits, irrelevant noise, prohibitive costs, poor scalability to large databases, and difficulty balancing recall and noise.

Method: AutoLink uses an autonomous agent framework guided by an LLM to dynamically explore and expand the linked schema subset through an iterative process, progressively identifying necessary schema components without requiring the full database schema.

Result: AutoLink achieves state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of 97.4% on Bird-Dev and 91.2% on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy of 68.7% EX on Bird-Dev and 34.9% EX on Spider-2.0-Lite, while maintaining exceptional scalability on large schemas with over 3,000 columns.

Conclusion: AutoLink provides a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems, overcoming the limitations of existing methods and maintaining robust performance on large databases.

Abstract: For industrial-scale text-to-SQL, supplying the entire database schema to Large Language Models (LLMs) is impractical due to context window limits and irrelevant noise. Schema linking, which filters the schema to a relevant subset, is therefore critical. However, existing methods incur prohibitive costs, struggle to trade off recall and noise, and scale poorly to large databases. We present \textbf{AutoLink}, an autonomous agent framework that reformulates schema linking as an iterative, agent-driven process. Guided by an LLM, AutoLink dynamically explores and expands the linked schema subset, progressively identifying necessary schema components without inputting the full database schema. Our experiments demonstrate AutoLink's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art strict schema linking recall of \textbf{97.4\%} on Bird-Dev and \textbf{91.2\%} on Spider-2.0-Lite, with competitive execution accuracy, i.e., \textbf{68.7\%} EX on Bird-Dev (better than CHESS) and \textbf{34.9\%} EX on Spider-2.0-Lite (ranking 2nd on the official leaderboard). Crucially, AutoLink exhibits \textbf{exceptional scalability}, \textbf{maintaining high recall}, \textbf{efficient token consumption}, and \textbf{robust execution accuracy} on large schemas (e.g., over 3,000 columns) where existing methods severely degrade-making it a highly scalable, high-recall schema-linking solution for industrial text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E3 is a layer pruning framework that addresses performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration through differentiable mask optimization and entropy-aware knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing layer pruning methods that struggle with performance degradation, high training costs, and limited inference acceleration simultaneously.

Method: Uses differentiable mask optimization with Gumbel-TopK sampler for efficient pruning mask search, and entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation for enhanced task performance.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy (only 0.8% drop from original 96.8%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming SOTA (95%), with 1.33× inference speedup using only 0.5B tokens (0.5% of post-training data).

Conclusion: E3 framework demonstrates superior performance in layer pruning across diverse model architectures and benchmarks, effectively balancing task effectiveness, training economy, and inference efficiency.

Abstract: With the increasing size of large language models, layer pruning has gained increased attention as a hardware-friendly approach for model compression. However, existing layer pruning methods struggle to simultaneously address key practical deployment challenges, including performance degradation, high training costs, and limited acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we propose \name, a task-\underline{E}ffective, training-\underline{E}conomical and inference-\underline{E}fficient layer pruning framework. \namespace introduces two key innovations: (1) a differentiable mask optimization method using a Gumbel-TopK sampler, enabling efficient and precise pruning mask search; and (2) an entropy-aware adaptive knowledge distillation strategy that enhances task performance. Extensive experiments over diverse model architectures and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, \namespace achieves 96\% accuracy, a mere 0.8\% drop from the original model (96.8\%) on MATH-500 when pruning 25\% layers of Qwen3-32B, outperforming existing SOTA (95\%), with a 1.33$\times$ inference speedup by consuming merely 0.5B tokens (0.5\% of the post-training data volume).

### [145] [A Simple Yet Strong Baseline for Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17208)
*Sizhe Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event-centric memory approach for conversational agents that represents dialogue history as short, event-like propositions organized in a heterogeneous graph, enabling better long-term coherence and personalization without aggressive compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based conversational agents struggle with maintaining coherent, personalized interactions over many sessions due to fixed context windows and limitations of existing memory approaches that trade off between coarse retrieval and fine-grained but fragmented views.

Method: Decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) - self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions - organized in a heterogeneous graph. Build two retrieval variants using dense similarity search with LLM filtering and optional graph-based propagation.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines while operating with much shorter QA contexts.

Conclusion: Structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents, preserving information in non-compressive form and making it more accessible.

Abstract: LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/KevinSRR/EMem.

*Yusuf Çelebi,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Özay Ezerceli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARROT is a framework that measures how LLMs' accuracy degrades under social pressure and authority influence, revealing significant sycophancy in older/smaller models while advanced models show better resistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity) in LLMs when faced with authoritative but false information, and to establish robustness against social pressure as a key safety metric.

Method: Uses double-blind evaluation comparing neutral vs authoritative false versions of questions, log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and an eight-state behavioral taxonomy to classify failure modes across 1,302 MMLU-style questions in 13 domains.

Result: Advanced models (GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) show low follow rates (≤11%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models exhibit severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94%). International law and global knowledge are most fragile, while elementary mathematics is resilient.

Conclusion: Resistance to overfitting pressure should be treated as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe real-world deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.

*Anshul Singh,Rohan Chaudhary,Gagneet Singh,Abhay Kumary*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MirageTVQA is a new multilingual benchmark with 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages that evaluates VLMs on visually imperfect tables with realistic noise, revealing significant performance drops and English-first bias in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular QA datasets are predominantly English-only and use digitally perfect tables, creating a gap between research and real-world scenarios where tables often contain visual noise and appear in multiple languages.

Method: Created MirageTVQA benchmark featuring multilingual tables with visual imperfections mimicking scanned documents, then evaluated leading VLMs on this dataset to assess performance degradation and language bias.

Result: Leading VLMs showed over 35% performance drop when faced with visual noise and demonstrated consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities failed to transfer to other languages.

Conclusion: MirageTVQA provides a crucial benchmark for measuring and improving VLM robustness in table reasoning, highlighting the need for models that can handle both multilingual content and visual imperfections commonly found in real-world documents.

Abstract: The impressive performance of VLMs is largely measured on benchmarks that fail to capture the complexities of real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

TL;DR: Hybrid methodology for predicting both frequent and rare social media user behaviors using historical patterns, persona-specific models, and neural architectures, achieving strong performance on a large Bluesky dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus mainly on common actions like retweeting and liking, leaving rare but significant behaviors largely unexplored, creating a gap in comprehensive user behavior prediction.

Method: Combines four approaches: lookup database based on historical patterns, persona-specific LightGBM models with temporal/semantic features for common actions, hybrid neural architecture fusing text and temporal representations for rare actions, and text reply generation.

Result: Persona-specific models achieved 0.64 macro F1-score for common actions, rare action classifier achieved 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions, winning first place in SocialSim challenge at COLM 2025.

Conclusion: Effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies that recognize fundamental differences between action types, with hybrid approaches outperforming single-method solutions.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.

TL;DR: The paper presents a culturally adapted Estonian translation of the WinoGrande commonsense reasoning benchmark, showing that human-translated data yields better model performance than machine translation, with limited benefits from prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a reliable localized benchmark for evaluating language competency and reasoning in Estonian language models, addressing the limitations of machine translation for culturally sensitive tasks.

Method: Human translation by specialists, evaluation of proprietary and open-source models on both human-translated and machine-translated data, and exploration of prompt engineering for improved machine translation.

Result: Model performance on human-translated Estonian data was slightly lower than on original English, while machine-translated data performed notably worse. Prompt engineering provided limited improvements in translation quality or model accuracy.

Conclusion: Human translation by language specialists is crucial for reliable dataset adaptation and evaluation of language models, as machine translation and prompt engineering alone are insufficient for culturally sensitive reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a localized and culturally adapted Estonian translation of the test set from the widely used commonsense reasoning benchmark, WinoGrande. We detail the translation and adaptation process carried out by translation specialists and evaluate the performance of both proprietary and open source models on the human translated benchmark. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of achieving high-quality machine translation by incorporating insights from the manual translation process into the design of a detailed prompt. This prompt is specifically tailored to address both the linguistic characteristics of Estonian and the unique translation challenges posed by the WinoGrande dataset. Our findings show that model performance on the human translated Estonian dataset is slightly lower than on the original English test set, while performance on machine-translated data is notably worse. Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.

*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Matthias Wölfel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes zero-shot sentiment analysis performance of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, Dolly 2) on South African social media posts in English, Sepedi and Setswana, focusing on 10 emerging topics across government departments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages to detect social challenges, as no previous work has investigated this application in multilingual South African contexts.

Method: Analyzed zero-shot performance of five LLMs on sentiment classification of social media posts in English, Sepedi and Setswana covering 10 emerging topics across 10 government departments, and implemented fusion of LLM outcomes.

Result: Large performance differences between LLMs, topics, and languages were observed. Fusion of multiple LLM outcomes achieved sentiment classification errors below 1%, enabling reliable detection of social challenges.

Conclusion: It is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable sentiment analysis information to detect social challenges and identify action needs across different topics and language groups in South Africa.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis can aid in understanding people's opinions and emotions on social issues. In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.

*Mateusz Jacniacki,Martí Carmona Serrat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HUMA is an LLM-based conversational agent designed for natural multi-party group chats using human-like strategies and timing, with participants unable to reliably distinguish it from human facilitators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current conversational AI systems are designed for one-on-one turn-based exchanges, but as AI assistants become widespread, developing natural humanlike interaction patterns is crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement in group settings.

Method: HUMA uses an event-driven architecture with three components (Router, Action Agent, and Reflection) that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation to adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.

Result: In a study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, participants classified community managers as human at near-chance rates in both AI and human conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience metrics showed only modest differences with small effect sizes.

Conclusion: An AI facilitator like HUMA can match human quality in natural group chat settings while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman, suggesting the potential for seamless AI integration in multi-party conversations.

Abstract: Conversational agents built on large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet most systems are designed for one-on-one, turn-based exchanges rather than natural, asynchronous group chats. As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.
  We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.

*Xiaoyun Jin,Mirjam Ernestus,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how semantic meaning influences pitch contours in Mandarin monosyllabic words during spontaneous conversation, using statistical modeling to show that word meaning is a stronger predictor of tonal realization than traditional phonetic factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how semantic factors affect pitch contours in Mandarin speech, challenging traditional phonetic theories that primarily attribute tonal variations to phonetic and contextual factors rather than meaning.

Method: Used generalized additive models to decompose pitch contours into components tied to control variables and semantic predictors, analyzing spontaneous conversational Mandarin data while controlling for factors like duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position.

Result: Word meaning was found to be a strong predictor of tonal realization even when controlling for phonetic variables. Word sense predicted pitch contours better than word identity alone, heterographic homophones had different pitch contours, and contextualized embeddings could predict individual word token pitch contours with accuracy exceeding permutation baselines.

Conclusion: Semantic factors significantly influence Mandarin pitch contours, challenging standard tone theories but supporting the Discriminative Lexicon Model framework. Distributional semantics provides a new approach for phonetic analysis.

Abstract: We present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of words' meanings. We used the generalized additive model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours that are tied to different control variables and semantic predictors. Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block. Although our findings challenge standard theories of Mandarin tone, they fit well within the theoretical framework of the Discriminative Lexicon Model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust natural language understanding that is less susceptible to textual biases and surface heuristics by leveraging visual modality as meaning representation.

Method: Generate visual representations of premises using text-to-image models, then perform inference by comparing these visual representations with textual hypotheses using cosine similarity and visual question answering techniques.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in NLI without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics, validated through controlled adversarial dataset.

Conclusion: Leveraging visual modality as meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

Abstract: We propose a zero-shot method for Natural Language Inference (NLI) that leverages multimodal representations by grounding language in visual contexts. Our approach generates visual representations of premises using text-to-image models and performs inference by comparing these representations with textual hypotheses. We evaluate two inference techniques: cosine similarity and visual question answering. Our method achieves high accuracy without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness against textual biases and surface heuristics. Additionally, we design a controlled adversarial dataset to validate the robustness of our approach. Our findings suggest that leveraging visual modality as a meaning representation provides a promising direction for robust natural language understanding.

TL;DR: Selective RoPE introduces input-dependent rotary position embeddings that generalize RoPE by enabling arbitrary rotation angles, improving performance in language modeling and sequence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the benefits of selective gating (which improves language tasks) with position encoding, by creating input-dependent rotary embeddings that can handle arbitrary rotation angles.

Method: Developed Selective RoPE as an input-dependent rotary embedding mechanism that generalizes RoPE, enabling rotation in arbitrary angles for both linear and softmax transformers. Showed that softmax attention performs hidden rotations on query-key pairs.

Result: Demonstrated that equipping gated transformers with Selective RoPE improves performance in language modeling and difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

Conclusion: Selective RoPE successfully combines selective gating with position encoding through input-dependent rotations, uncovering implicit positional structures in transformers and improving performance on various language tasks.

Abstract: Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.

*Yesheng Liu,Hao Li,Haiyu Xu,Baoqi Pei,Jiahao Wang,Mingxuan Zhao,Jingshu Zheng,Zheqi He,JG Yao,Bowen Qin,Xi Yang,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReVeL framework converts multiple-choice questions to open-form questions to address answer guessing and signal leakage issues in MCQA, improving model training and evaluation reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) suffers from exploitable signals in options that make accuracy metrics unreliable and encourage answer guessing behaviors during reinforcement fine-tuning.

Method: Proposed ReVeL framework that rewrites MCQA into open-form questions, categorizes questions by answer types, applies different rewriting and verification schemes, and uses GRPO for fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL models.

Result: Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on benchmarks while improving OpenQA accuracy by ~6 percentage points, revealing up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks compared to OpenQA.

Conclusion: ReVeL provides better data efficiency, more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training, improves judging accuracy, and reduces cost and latency for evaluation.

Abstract: Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) has been a popular format for evaluating and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of modern multimodal language models. Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency. We will release code and data publicly.

*Zhen Wang,Zhifeng Gao,Guolin Ke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-RLVR enhances mathematical reasoning in LLMs using self-supervised rewards from masked-and-reordered intermediate steps, achieving significant performance gains over standard RLVR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLVR struggles with mathematical theorem proving where intermediate reasoning is crucial but final answers are hard to verify, and token-level SFT often leads to memorization rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Self-supervised training with 'masked-then-fill' and 'step reordering' to create process-level rewards, 2) RLVR fine-tuning on outcome-verifiable mathematical datasets.

Result: On Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, MR-RLVR achieved +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8 improvements over original RLVR on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Process-aware self-supervised signals effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in outcome-verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.

*Chang-Yong Song,David Hyde*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PhysMorph-GS bridges the gap between physics simulation and rendering by coupling differentiable MPM with 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling image-based losses to guide physics optimization through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-based shape morphing methods suffer from a "rendering gap" where nondifferentiable surface extraction prevents image losses from directly guiding physics optimization, limiting the ability to achieve high-fidelity results from image supervision.

Method: Couples differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting using a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states to dense Gaussians, with multi-modal rendering losses backpropagating through two paths to update deformation controls while conserving mass.

Result: Improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over differentiable MPM baseline, better reconstructs thin structures like ears and tails, and reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5% relative to physics-only baseline in depth-supervised variant.

Conclusion: PhysMorph-GS closes the key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines by providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, enabling inverse design directly from image-space supervision.

Abstract: Shape morphing with physics-based simulation naturally supports large deformations and topology changes, but existing methods suffer from a "rendering gap": nondifferentiable surface extraction prevents image losses from directly guiding physics optimization. We introduce PhysMorph-GS, which couples a differentiable material point method (MPM) with 3D Gaussian splatting through a deformation-aware upsampling bridge that maps sparse particle states (x, F) to dense Gaussians (mu, Sigma). Multi-modal rendering losses on silhouette and depth backpropagate along two paths, from covariances to deformation gradients via a stretch-based mapping and from Gaussian means to particle positions. Through the MPM adjoint, these gradients update deformation controls while mass is conserved at a compact set of anchor particles. A multi-pass interleaved optimization scheme repeatedly injects rendering gradients into successive physics steps, avoiding collapse to purely physics-driven solutions. On challenging morphing sequences, PhysMorph-GS improves boundary fidelity and temporal stability over a differentiable MPM baseline and better reconstructs thin structures such as ears and tails. Quantitatively, our depth-supervised variant reduces Chamfer distance by about 2.5 percent relative to the physics-only baseline. By providing a differentiable particle-to-Gaussian bridge, PhysMorph-GS closes a key gap in physics-aware rendering pipelines and enables inverse design directly from image-space supervision.

TL;DR: This study compares visual creativity between humans and AI image generation, finding humans outperform AI, with increased human guidance improving AI creativity. Human and AI raters show different judgment patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore visual creativity in AI compared to humans, as previous research focused mainly on language creativity where LLMs match human performance, but visual creativity remains underexplored.

Method: Compared image generation between human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and AI (with high and low human input prompting). Used human raters and GPT4o to evaluate creativity of resulting images.

Result: Found clear creativity gradient: Visual Artists > Non Artists > Human Inspired AI > Self Guided AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved AI creativity, bringing it close to Non Artists. Human and AI raters showed different creativity judgment patterns.

Conclusion: GenAI faces unique challenges in visual domains where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity - distinctly human capacities not readily transferable from language models.

Abstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an interpretable cognitive control layer for LLMs by repurposing retro BASIC's simplicity, enabling transparent reasoning through explicit execution traces.

Method: Uses numbered lines and simple commands as a prompting language, with a natural-language interpreter file specifying command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. The mental-model interpreter extracts knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions.

Result: Comparison across three LLMs on knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs with overall strong but not uniform performance.

Conclusion: Cognitive BASIC provides an effective framework for structuring LLM reasoning into interpretable, stepwise execution traces, enabling reliable simulation of short programs for transparent multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: Cognitive BASIC is a minimal, BASIC-style prompting language and in-model interpreter that structures large language model (LLM) reasoning into explicit, stepwise execution traces. Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invalid benchmark questions undermine AI evaluation reliability, and manual correction of thousands of questions is infeasible, creating a critical bottleneck for reliable assessment.

Method: Leverages statistical analysis of response patterns based on the assumption that mean score summarizes model performance, flagging items when empirical statistics fall outside expected ranges, plus an LLM-judge first pass for initial review.

Result: Achieved up to 84% precision in identifying problematic questions across nine widely used benchmarks, with LLM-judge reducing human review effort.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision that combines statistical analysis with automated first-pass review to improve benchmark reliability.

Abstract: Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.

### [162] [Hybrid Differential Reward: Combining Temporal Difference and Action Gradients for Efficient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Cooperative Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16916)
*Ye Han,Lijun Zhang,Dejian Meng,Zhuang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism to solve vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, combining Temporal Difference Reward and Action Gradient Reward to improve policy gradient SNR and learning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state-based reward functions in multi-vehicle cooperative driving suffer from vanishing reward differences due to temporal quasi-steady traffic states and physical proximity of actions, leading to low signal-to-noise ratio in policy gradients that hinders algorithm convergence.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) with two components: Temporal Difference Reward based on global potential function for long-term objectives, and Action Gradient Reward for local guidance with high SNR. Formulates cooperative driving as Multi-Agent POMDPG with time-varying agent set.

Result: Extensive experiments with online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent RL algorithms (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) show HDR significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability, enabling agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies balancing traffic efficiency and safety.

Conclusion: HDR mechanism effectively addresses vanishing reward differences in multi-vehicle cooperative driving, providing superior reward signals that guide agents to learn efficient and safe cooperative policies across different algorithms.

Abstract: In multi-vehicle cooperative driving tasks involving high-frequency continuous control, traditional state-based reward functions suffer from the issue of vanishing reward differences. This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.

*Erik P. Nyberg,Steven Mascaro,Ingrid Zukerman,Michael Wybrow,Duc-Minh Vo,Ann Nicholson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents UI extensions (verbal, visual, and combined) for Bayesian Networks to improve user understanding, showing that all extensions outperform baseline UI and combined modality works best for certain question types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Bayesian Networks being considered transparent models, users struggle to understand them, and current UIs fail to clarify BN reasoning, creating a need for improved interfaces.

Method: Designed verbal and visual extensions to standard BN UI to guide users through inference patterns, then conducted user study comparing verbal, visual, combined extensions against baseline UI.

Result: Users performed better with all three extension types than baseline UI for questions about observation impact, enabling paths, and observation influence; combined verbal-visual modality outperformed single modalities for some question types.

Conclusion: Verbal and visual UI extensions significantly improve user understanding of Bayesian Networks, with combined modality providing the best performance for certain inference tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian Networks (BNs) are an important tool for assisting probabilistic reasoning, but despite being considered transparent models, people have trouble understanding them. Further, current User Interfaces (UIs) still do not clarify the reasoning of BNs. To address this problem, we have designed verbal and visual extensions to the standard BN UI, which can guide users through common inference patterns.
  We conducted a user study to compare our verbal, visual and combined UI extensions, and a baseline UI. Our main findings are: (1) users did better with all three types of extensions than with the baseline UI for questions about the impact of an observation, the paths that enable this impact, and the way in which an observation influences the impact of other observations; and (2) using verbal and visual modalities together is better than using either modality alone for some of these question types.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MirrorMind is a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates individual researcher cognition with collective disciplinary knowledge to enable more authentic AI scientific reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI approaches treat scientific discovery as solitary optimization, overlooking the social and historical nature of knowledge production where individual cognitive trajectories and collective disciplinary memory are both crucial.

Method: A three-level hierarchical architecture: Individual Level (episodic, semantic, persona memories), Domain Level (structured disciplinary concept graphs), and Interdisciplinary Level (orchestration engine), with separation between memory storage and agentic execution.

Result: Evaluation across four tasks shows MirrorMind enables structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning beyond simple fact retrieval, effectively simulating author cognition, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and multi-agent problem solving.

Conclusion: By integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind advances AI scientific reasoning toward more authentic, structured knowledge production that captures both personal perspectives and social knowledge networks.

Abstract: The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces budget-aware methods for scaling tool-augmented agents, showing that simply increasing tool-call budgets doesn't improve performance without budget awareness. They propose Budget Tracker and BATS framework to enable effective scaling under explicit constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-augmented agents lack budget awareness when scaling test-time computation, hitting performance ceilings despite increased tool-call budgets. There's a need for principled approaches to scale agents effectively under resource constraints.

Method: Proposed Budget Tracker (lightweight plug-in for continuous budget awareness) and BATS framework that dynamically adapts planning and verification strategies based on remaining resources. Also formalized a unified cost metric combining token and tool consumption.

Result: Budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier compared to naive scaling approaches. Systematic study shows effective performance improvements under budget constraints.

Conclusion: Budget awareness is crucial for effective scaling of tool-augmented agents. The proposed methods enable more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in resource-constrained environments, offering empirical insights for future agent development.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only "thinking" in tokens but also "acting" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack "budget awareness" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to "dig deeper" on a promising lead or "pivot" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets score-based diffusion for inverse problems as an EM-style framework, introducing DAPS++ which decouples diffusion and data refinement for more efficient and stable reconstruction with fewer function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Bayesian interpretation of diffusion-based inverse problem solving fails to explain practical behavior where reconstruction is largely driven by measurement consistency rather than the prior, suggesting a need for better theoretical understanding and more efficient methods.

Method: Proposes DAPS++ framework that reinterprets diffusion as initialization within EM-style framework, fully decoupling diffusion stage from data-driven refinement to allow likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability.

Result: DAPS++ achieves high computational efficiency with fewer function evaluations and measurement-optimization steps, demonstrating robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: The EM-style reinterpretation provides insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice, and DAPS++ offers a more direct likelihood-guided inference approach with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: From a Bayesian perspective, score-based diffusion solves inverse problems through joint inference, embedding the likelihood with the prior to guide the sampling process. However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-modal method for patient-level information extraction that combines structured EHR data (via Bayesian networks) with unstructured clinical notes (via neural text classifiers), using virtual evidence with consistency nodes for improved calibration and interpretable fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs contain valuable but fragmented information - structured data (diagnosis codes, medications) and unstructured text (discharge summaries, notes). To build reliable clinical decision support systems, we need methods that can effectively integrate both data types while handling missing information and contradictions.

Method: Proposes multi-modal fusion using: 1) Bayesian network for structured EHR data with expert knowledge, 2) Neural text classifiers for clinical notes, 3) Virtual evidence with consistency nodes for probabilistic fusion to improve calibration and handle contradictions between data sources.

Result: The method shows improved calibration of final predictions compared to using virtual evidence alone. The consistency node helps the Bayesian network better adjust neural classifier outputs to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between tabular and text data.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal fusion approach with consistency nodes provides an interpretable, probabilistic framework for integrating structured and unstructured EHR data, enabling more reliable clinical decision support systems through better calibration and contradiction resolution.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.

TL;DR: This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology as a modular design pattern that captures agent cognitive architecture through beliefs, desires, and intentions, with experiments showing its integration with LLMs and reasoning platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited integration of the BDI model into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations, despite its importance in AI and cognitive sciences.

Method: Developed a formal BDI Ontology as a modular Ontology Design Pattern, aligned with foundational ontologies, and tested it through two experiments: LLM integration via Logic Augmented Generation and integration with the Semas reasoning platform implementing T2B2T paradigm.

Result: The ontology successfully bridges declarative and procedural intelligence, enabling bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states, and enhances inferential coherence and consistency when coupled with LLMs.

Conclusion: The BDI Ontology provides a conceptual and operational foundation for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems in the Web of Data.

Abstract: The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model is a cornerstone for representing rational agency in artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Yet, its integration into structured, semantically interoperable knowledge representations remains limited. This paper presents a formal BDI Ontology, conceived as a modular Ontology Design Pattern (ODP) that captures the cognitive architecture of agents through beliefs, desires, intentions, and their dynamic interrelations. The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states.

*Kesheng Chen,Wenjian Luo,Bang Zhang,Zeping Yin,Zipeng Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a novel method for multi-agent reinforcement learning that addresses the challenge of sparse episodic rewards by incentivizing agents to explore actions that affect their teammates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Episodic rewards pose significant challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning due to exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories and existing methods' failure to account for joint actions that influence team states.

Method: The paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), which encourages individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates. When combined with original strategies, MIR stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance.

Result: Experimental evaluation using the newly created MiniGrid-MA environment shows that MIR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multi-agent reinforcement learning with sparse rewards.

Conclusion: MIR is a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards that successfully addresses the challenges of joint action exploration and team state influence.

Abstract: Episodic rewards present a significant challenge in reinforcement learning. While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.

### [170] [Designing Domain-Specific Agents via Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17198)
*Kaiyu Li,Jiayu Wang,Zhi Wang,Hui Qiao,Weizhan Zhang,Deyu Meng,Xiangyong Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTAM, a hierarchical task abstraction framework for multi-agent systems that structures agents according to domain-specific task dependencies, and demonstrates its effectiveness in geospatial analysis through EarthAgent, which outperforms existing approaches on the GeoPlan-bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General agent frameworks like ReAct struggle in specialized domains requiring structured workflows, such as remote sensing with specialized tools and multi-step procedures, creating a need for domain-aligned agent architectures.

Method: Proposed Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM) that structures multi-agent systems into logical hierarchies mirroring domain task-dependency graphs, enforcing procedural correctness through sequential layers where sub-agents operate on preceding layers' outputs.

Result: EarthAgent, instantiated using HTAM for geospatial analysis, substantially outperforms established single- and multi-agent systems on GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark with metrics for tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness.

Conclusion: Aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is critical for building robust specialized autonomous systems, as demonstrated by the success of the task-centric HTAM framework in complex geospatial analysis.

Abstract: LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.

Conclusion: The AAMAS community's conceptual tools provide the necessary foundation for developing agentic AI systems that combine adaptive capabilities with structured reasoning and coordination, enabling transparent, cooperative, and accountable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI seeks to endow systems with sustained autonomy, reasoning, and interaction capabilities. To realize this vision, its assumptions about agency must be complemented by explicit models of cognition, cooperation, and governance. This paper argues that the conceptual tools developed within the Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) community, such as BDI architectures, communication protocols, mechanism design, and institutional modelling, provide precisely such a foundation. By aligning adaptive, data-driven approaches with structured models of reasoning and coordination, we outline a path toward agentic systems that are not only capable and flexible, but also transparent, cooperative, and accountable. The result is a perspective on agency that bridges formal theory and practical autonomy.

### [172] [That's not natural: The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408)
*Nathalie Kirch,Samuel Dower,Adrians Skapars,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Dmitrii Krasheninnikov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how using synthetic and off-policy data affects probe generalization for monitoring LLM behaviors, finding that response generation strategy impacts performance and that same-domain off-policy data is more reliable than different-domain on-policy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalization for monitoring concerning LLM behaviors like deception and sycophancy, since natural examples are rare and researchers often rely on synthetic data.

Method: Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs across eight distinct behaviors, comparing performance using different response generation strategies and evaluating generalization from off-policy to on-policy data.

Result: Response generation strategy significantly affects probe performance, successful off-policy generalization predicts on-policy generalization, Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalize, and domain shifts cause even larger performance degradation than policy shifts.

Conclusion: In the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling inference-time detection of concerning behaviours such as deception and sycophancy. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.

*Jiaxi Liu,Chengyuan Ma,Hang Zhou,Weizhe Tang,Shixiao Liang,Haoyang Ding,Xiaopeng Li,Bin Ran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SRA-CP is a decentralized cooperative perception framework that enables connected vehicles to selectively share safety-critical perception data only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected, reducing communication bandwidth by 80% while maintaining near-perfect safety-critical object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative perception approaches transmit excessive irrelevant data exceeding bandwidth limits and rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments.

Method: Decentralized protocol where vehicles broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. Includes perceptual risk identification and selective information exchange with bandwidth adaptation.

Result: Achieves <1% AP loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP while using only 20% of communication bandwidth. Improves perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods without risk awareness.

Conclusion: SRA-CP provides an efficient and adaptive cooperative perception solution that balances communication efficiency with safety-critical perception performance in dynamic traffic environments.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.
