Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a\ncentral role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing\nunsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing\nprobability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,\naggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using\npredefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research\nleverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict\nuncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex\nmultimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to\nidentify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by\nthese observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly\nleverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output\ndistribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses.

Inspired by\nthis principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept\nlearning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with\n2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more\ncoherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot\nvisualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised\nmodels by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,\nin linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets\nnew SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%\nmIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for\nvideo-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly\nprojects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling\nopen-world perception.
