*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene is an online framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic driving scenes from two consecutive surround-view images using a lightweight residual flow network and coarse-to-fine training, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is challenging due to complex dynamics and sparse views, with existing methods struggling to balance quality and efficiency.

Method: Uses a lightweight residual flow network that predicts non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. Employs a coarse-to-fine training paradigm to avoid instabilities in end-to-end approaches.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DrivingScene framework effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse views, achieving superior performance in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM is a motion-augmented caption model that improves video captioning by incorporating motion-aware decoding using human mesh recovery to capture fine-grained human body dynamics, reducing hallucinations and improving semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning models struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, leading to vague or semantically inconsistent captions when describing human actions in videos.

Method: Introduces Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM) that leverages motion representations from human mesh recovery to explicitly highlight human body dynamics through motion-aware decoding.

Result: M-ACM significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for motion-centric video captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed M-ACM framework with motion-aware decoding effectively enhances caption quality by reducing hallucinations and improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in generated video descriptions.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,CÃ©dric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training Deep Learning models for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on SAR images using synthetic data from simulators to overcome lack of real labeled data, and proposing a dual-simulator approach to improve generalization to real measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of real labeled SAR measurements for ATR by using synthetic data from simulators, while overcoming the limitations of simulation assumptions that prevent good generalization to real data.

Method: Using two complementary SAR simulators (MOCEM with scattering centers model and Salsa with ray tracing) to generate synthetic datasets, and training ATR models with the ADASCA Deep Learning approach.

Result: Achieved nearly 88% accuracy on MSTAR real measurements, demonstrating improved generalization from synthetic to real data.

Conclusion: Combining multiple simulators with different paradigms can effectively bridge the gap between synthetic training data and real SAR measurements for ATR tasks.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework using Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict point-level uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning point clouds based on local geometric features, achieving mean ROC-AUC >0.87 without requiring high-precision reference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uncertainty modeling for MLS point clouds requires costly high-precision reference data that is often infeasible for large-scale applications, creating a need for more scalable uncertainty evaluation methods.

Method: Proposed a machine learning framework that learns relationships between local geometric features and point-level errors using ensemble learning models (RF and XGBoost), trained on spatially partitioned real-world datasets to prevent data leakage.

Result: Both RF and XGBoost models effectively captured nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. Key predictive features included elevation variation, point density, and local structural complexity.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, data-driven approach for uncertainty evaluation in large-scale point clouds, offering a foundation for future quality control and error analysis without requiring expensive reference data.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal framework combining eye-tracking and facial features for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, achieving 95.11% accuracy through cross-attention fusion and directional-aware facial feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate AD diagnosis is crucial for timely intervention. While eye-tracking and facial features individually reflect cognitive function, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis, despite their complementary nature.

Method: Proposed a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework with two key modules: Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) for inter-modal interactions via cross-attention and global enhancement, and Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) for capturing fine-grained directional facial features using horizontal-vertical receptive fields.

Result: Achieved 95.11% classification accuracy in distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls, outperforming traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods. Framework demonstrated superior robustness and diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal framework effectively models inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions, providing a robust approach for AD diagnosis by synergistically leveraging eye-tracking and facial features.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA is a full-stack optimization framework that accelerates photorealistic codec avatar inference on VR devices through efficient quantization and custom hardware acceleration, achieving real-time performance with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA) enable immersive VR communication but face computational challenges on resource-constrained VR devices where latency and power efficiency are critical.

Method: Proposed an efficient post-training quantization method for Codec Avatar models and designed a custom hardware accelerator integrated into VR SoCs, combined into the ESCA optimization framework.

Result: ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to +0.39 over 4-bit baselines, delivers 3.36Ã latency reduction, and sustains 100 FPS rendering rate in end-to-end tests.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices, enabling more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models match GNN performance on graph benchmarks but learn differently, excelling at holistic structural understanding while GNNs struggle with global patterns and scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs use bottom-up message-passing which differs from human visual perception that captures global structures first. Existing benchmarks conflate domain features with topological understanding.

Method: Introduce GraphAbstract benchmark to evaluate models' ability to perceive global graph properties like organizational archetypes, symmetry, connectivity strength, and critical elements.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on holistic structural understanding tasks and maintain generalizability across graph scales, while GNNs degrade with increasing graph size.

Conclusion: Vision models possess remarkable underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning, opening new avenues for graph foundation models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM is a graph-based semi-supervised learning method for multi-view data that combines graph fusion, pseudo-labeling, topological correction, and unsupervised smoothing to improve classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph-based methods struggle with multi-view data due to unclear graph structures in images and the complexity of integrating multiple views, limiting their efficiency in semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Method: Combines linear feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion in GCN framework, dynamically incorporates pseudo-labels into loss function, corrects topological imbalances by adjusting labeled sample weights near boundaries, and adds unsupervised smoothing loss for all samples.

Result: Experimental results on multi-view benchmark image datasets show RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods in multi-view contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed RSGSLM method effectively addresses multi-view data challenges and achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for generating emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by modeling facial animation as a linear additive problem that combines speech-driven and emotion-driven blendshapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-driven talking-face animation methods lack emotional expressivity, and there's a scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to high data capture costs.

Method: The approach models facial animation as a linear additive problem using blendshapes driven by both speech and emotion. It uses VOCAset (neutral expressions) and Florence4D (3D expression sequences) to jointly learn blendshapes with sparsity constraint loss for disentanglement, then maps them to FLAME model parameters for 3D Gaussian avatar animation.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies demonstrate superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods without compromising lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: The proposed linear additive modeling approach successfully generates emotionally expressive 3D talking faces by disentangling speech and emotion components, addressing the data scarcity problem through joint learning from available datasets.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

### [11] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench is a multilingual benchmark derived from expert-created PISA tests, covering six languages with human-verified examples to address limitations in current vision-language model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language model benchmarks are limited by synthetic LLM-generated content and English-only datasets, lacking high-quality human-verified multilingual examples.

Method: Created PISA-Bench by extracting human-verified examples from PISA tests, translating them into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian), and evaluating state-of-the-art VLMs on this parallel corpus.

Result: Small VLMs (<20B parameters) fail to achieve high scores, show substantial performance degradation on non-English splits, and have high error rates in spatial and geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: PISA-Bench provides a valuable resource for advancing multilingual multimodal reasoning research, revealing significant gaps in current VLM capabilities across languages and reasoning types.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

### [12] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D is a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation that repurposes pre-trained static 3D diffusion models by extending Score Distillation Sampling to handle articulation as an additional dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for articulated 3D objects either require dense-view supervision or produce coarse approximations without textures, while training native 3D diffusion models for articulated objects is challenging due to limited data.

Method: FreeArt3D extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension, using pre-trained static 3D diffusion models as shape priors and jointly optimizing geometry, texture, and articulation parameters from a few images.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, generalizes across diverse object categories, completes in minutes, and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D demonstrates that articulated 3D generation can be achieved without task-specific training by leveraging existing static 3D diffusion models and extending SDS to handle articulation, providing an efficient and versatile solution.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Conclusion: This comprehensive survey serves as a foundational resource for advancing efficient VLA research, with ongoing updates maintained through a dedicated project page to track latest developments in the field.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We

### [14] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models exhibit human-like conflict adaptation behavior in Stroop tasks, with neural analysis revealing specialized supernodes that handle text-color conflicts similarly to human cognitive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models demonstrate human-like cognitive control mechanisms, specifically conflict adaptation, and understand the neural representations underlying this behavior.

Method: Used sequential Stroop task experiments on 13 vision-language models, combined with sparse autoencoders to analyze neural representations in InternVL 3.5 4B model, including ablation studies of identified supernodes.

Result: 12 out of 13 VLMs showed conflict adaptation behavior; identified partially overlapping text and color supernodes in early and late layers, with size asymmetry mirroring human automaticity; isolated conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increased Stroop errors.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit human-like cognitive control signatures, with specialized neural representations that parallel human cognitive architecture for handling conflicting information.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [15] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap is a lightweight retrieval-augmented image captioning model that uses dual retrieval (image-to-text and image-to-image) to generate both text and visual prompts, enhancing visual representations for better object details and complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight retrieval-augmented caption models only use retrieved data as text prompts, creating a semantic gap by leaving original visual features unenhanced, especially for object details and complex scenes.

Method: Proposes DualCap with dual retrieval: standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and novel image-to-image retrieval for visually similar scenes. Salient keywords from similar scenes' captions are encoded and integrated with original image features through a lightweight trainable feature fusion network.

Result: Extensive experiments show competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: DualCap effectively addresses the semantic gap in lightweight retrieval-augmented captioning by enriching visual representations through dual retrieval mechanisms, achieving strong performance with reduced parameter requirements.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage deep learning framework combining vision transformers, classical ML classifiers, and feature selection achieves 85.99% accuracy for fish freshness assessment, outperforming previous methods by 8.69-22.78%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensory evaluation of fish freshness is subjective and inconsistent, while existing deep learning approaches lack accuracy and feature transparency.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune five vision architectures, 2) Extract multi-level features to train seven classical ML classifiers, 3) Apply feature selection methods (LGBM, Random Forest, Lasso) to identify optimal feature subsets.

Result: Best configuration (Swin-Tiny features + Extra Trees classifier + LGBM feature selection) achieves 85.99% accuracy on FFE dataset, outperforming recent studies by 8.69-22.78%.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework is effective and generalizable for visual quality evaluation tasks, providing reliable fish freshness assessment with improved accuracy and feature transparency.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MVFNDB, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-modal large language models in video fake news detection, featuring 10 tasks and 9730 annotated questions to assess perception, understanding, and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video fake news detection benchmarks focus only on final accuracy without providing fine-grained assessment of the detection process, making it a black box that lacks transparency and detailed evaluation.

Method: Created MVFNDB benchmark with 10 tasks based on empirical analysis, designed a novel MVFND-CoT framework that incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning, and conducted analysis on video processing strategies and feature-model alignment.

Result: The benchmark provides 9730 human-annotated video-related questions with a carefully constructed taxonomy for VFND abilities, enabling comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' detection capabilities beyond just final accuracy.

Conclusion: The MVFNDB benchmark lays a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in video fake news detection by providing detailed assessment of the entire detection process rather than just final outcomes.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-round safety editing framework for text-to-image models that reduces over-refusal while maintaining better safety-utility balance through post-hoc editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time safety methods for text-to-image models suffer from over-refusal and poor balance between safety and utility, requiring a more effective solution.

Method: Proposes MR-SafeEdit dataset and SafeEditor MLLM for multi-round safety editing, using a post-hoc paradigm that mimics human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content.

Result: SafeEditor outperforms previous safety approaches by reducing over-refusal and achieving better safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: The multi-round safety editing framework provides an effective, model-agnostic solution for text-to-image model safety alignment that addresses limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate multimodal emotion recognition faces challenges due to differences between modalities and difficulty in characterizing unimodal emotional information, which hinders effective human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses adversarial autoencoders (AAE) for each modality to learn discriminative features, then applies Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality discrepancies and generate interaction features, followed by Feature Fusion module (FFM) for multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments on SIMS and MOSI datasets demonstrate that MCIHN achieves superior performance in multimodal emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIHN model effectively addresses modality differences and improves emotion recognition accuracy through its hybrid network architecture with multipath cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior

TL;DR: The paper analyzes flow matching from a denoising perspective, establishing formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers, and provides insights into the distinct dynamical phases of the generative process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, but the factors influencing the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. The authors aim to better understand these factors by adopting a denoising perspective.

Method: The authors design a framework to empirically probe the generation process, laying down formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers. This enables principled and controlled perturbations (noise and drift) to influence sample generation.

Result: The framework provides new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative process, enabling precise characterization of when denoisers succeed or fail during generation.

Conclusion: Understanding the distinct phases of the generative process and when denoisers succeed or fail is crucial for improving flow matching models, as this knowledge helps explain why certain aspects matter in the generation process.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

*Sidharth Rai,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Benjamin Vail,Keziban YalÃ§Ä±n DokumacÄ±,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes reframing fruit maturity estimation from discrete classification to continuous probabilistic learning, introducing a probabilistic head to RT-DETRv2 that predicts continuous maturity distributions with uncertainty measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches treat fruit maturity as discrete classification, which conflicts with the continuous nature of biological ripening, causing information loss and ambiguous class boundaries.

Method: Modified RT-DETRv2 object detector by adding a dedicated probabilistic head that predicts continuous distribution over maturity spectrum, learning mean maturity state and associated uncertainty simultaneously.

Result: Achieved 85.6% mAP on challenging fruit dataset while providing richer biological representation and granular maturity assessments with uncertainty measures.

Conclusion: The probabilistic approach offers more accurate maturity assessments than classification-based methods and enables uncertainty-aware automated systems for modern agriculture.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

TL;DR: This paper explores using lightweight body landmark detection for Brazilian Sign Language recognition, finding that proper landmark subset selection with spline-based imputation achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by over 5x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the time performance limitations of using OpenPose for landmark extraction in sign language recognition, while maintaining accuracy when switching to lightweight MediaPipe.

Method: Used landmark subset selection strategies and spline-based imputation to optimize recognition performance with lightweight MediaPipe instead of OpenPose.

Result: Proper landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to previous work.

Conclusion: Careful landmark selection combined with simple imputation techniques enables efficient and accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language Recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Motivation: Address traffic congestion in growing urban cities by developing efficient traffic flow optimization solutions.

Method: Analyze sequential camera frames to compute background via pixel averaging, then use background subtraction and DBSCAN clustering for vehicle detection.

Result: Computationally efficient vehicle detection requiring minimal infrastructure modifications.

Conclusion: Proposed methodology provides practical and scalable solution for real-world traffic optimization deployment.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban

designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and

TL;DR: VividCam enables text-to-video models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos instead of real videos, using disentanglement strategies to isolate motion learning from synthetic artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with unconventional camera motions due to insufficient training data with such motions, limiting artistic video creation.

Method: Proposes VividCam training paradigm using synthetic videos from engines like Unity, with multiple disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts.

Result: The method synthesizes a wide range of precisely controlled complex camera motions using simple synthetic data (basic geometries in low-poly 3D scenes).

Conclusion: VividCam successfully enables robust camera motion learning from synthetic data, overcoming the limitation of scarce real training videos for unconventional camera motions.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Conclusion: The work provides insights into the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers, shedding light on their operation and differences from traditional methods, with potential implications for improving these models and enabling safer applications.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D

layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-SAM is a model-agnostic framework that addresses modality dominance in multimodal learning by identifying dominant modalities using Shapley values, modulating the loss landscape to prioritize robustness for dominant modalities, and updating weights with modulated gradients to enhance overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting generalization and preventing models from effectively leveraging complementary features across different modalities.

Method: M-SAM operates in three steps per iteration: 1) Identifies dominant modality using Shapley values based on accuracy contributions, 2) Decomposes the loss landscape by modulating loss to prioritize robustness for the dominant modality, 3) Updates weights through backpropagation of modulated gradients.

Result: Extensive experiments on four diverse datasets show M-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, significantly balancing and improving multimodal learning performance.

Conclusion: M-SAM enables robust learning for dominant modalities while enhancing contributions from others, allowing models to better explore and exploit complementary features that strengthen overall multimodal performance.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Result: Achieved movement recognition accuracy of nearly 99% with comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirming the significant effectiveness of the solution.

Conclusion: The IBIS hybrid architecture successfully addresses overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing and demonstrates high accuracy in movement recognition applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture

generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy

Result: Achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV on the Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Designed and tested for live inference with clinically grounded natural-language explanations.

Conclusion: FT-ARM advances reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment by integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, addressing the need for consistent and explainable PU staging.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning-based ALPR system using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition, enhanced with semi-supervised learning using Grounding DINO for automated annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR systems face challenges from environmental factors, vehicle speeds, camera angles, and image quality, while being crucial for traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications.

Method: Uses YOLOv8 for detection and recognition, combined with semi-supervised learning framework that integrates manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO vision-language model for automated annotation.

Result: Achieved 94% recall on CENPARMI dataset and 91% recall on UFPR-ALPR dataset, with character error rates reported for both datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach using Grounding DINO for automated annotation effectively reduces manual labeling effort while maintaining high performance, making ALPR systems more scalable and efficient.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the

structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data

TL;DR: DRIP is a method that dynamically reduces visual tokens in deeper layers of vision encoders to improve efficiency while maintaining performance in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational cost of pretraining vision-language models from scratch discourages researchers, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP) adaptively merges tokens in deeper visual encoder layers based on input images.

Result: DRIP significantly reduces GFLOPs while maintaining comparable classification and zero-shot performance on ImageNet and CLIP pretraining, and shows effectiveness in scientific domains through biology dataset pretraining.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an effective approach to improve efficiency in vision-language model pretraining without sacrificing performance, extending its utility to scientific applications.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel per-subject-tuning-free (PSTF) method for personalized image generation that enables precise control over facial attributes while preserving facial identity, using face recognition features mapped to StyleGAN2's latent space and enhanced with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with precise facial attribute control in PSTF approaches, while tuning-based methods require extensive expertise and additional training data, limiting accessibility.

Method: Uses face recognition model to extract facial identity features, maps them to StyleGAN2's W+ latent space via e4e encoder, and integrates Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to separate identity and attribute information in UNet architecture.

Result: Successfully generates personalized images with fine-grained facial attribute control while preserving identity, without requiring additional fine-tuning or training data for individual identities.

Conclusion: The approach balances personalization with precise facial attribute control, offering an efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality facial image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

### [37] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDRP is a framework for zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection that addresses visual complexity through diversity-aware prompt learning and region-specific concept retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to handle visual complexity in interactions, including intra-class visual diversity (same verb appearing in diverse poses/contexts) and inter-class visual entanglement (different verbs having visually similar patterns).

Method: Proposes VDRP with two key components: (1) visual diversity-aware prompt learning that injects group-wise visual variance and applies Gaussian perturbation, and (2) region-specific concept retrieval from human, object, and union regions to create region-aware prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET benchmark under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: VDRP successfully handles the visual complexity of human-object interactions through diversity-aware and region-aware prompt learning, demonstrating superior performance in zero-shot HOI detection.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

TL;DR: A novel method combining Atlanta-world guidance with implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting for smooth 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban scenes, addressing low-texture regions while preserving details and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric priors for indoor and urban 3D reconstruction lack global consistency, and current methods like Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields suffer from discontinuities or computational inefficiencies, leading to loss of detail.

Method: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting with semantic GS representation and structure plane regularization using learnable plane indicators for global surface reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach achieves smooth reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency, effectively addressing limitations of existing methods in handling low-texture regions.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a novel activation method that improves upon conventional CAM by generating more complete object coverage and precise boundaries through semantic information maps and propagation using both gradients and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM methods only highlight the most discriminative regions, failing to cover entire objects and often misaligning with object boundaries, which limits performance in weakly supervised learning tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Region-CAM generates activation maps by extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information propagation (SIP) using both gradients and features from all stages of the baseline classification model.

Result: On PASCAL VOC: 60.12% mIoU (training) and 58.43% mIoU (validation), improving by 13.61% and 13.13% over original CAM. On MS COCO: 36.38% mIoU, improving by 16.23% over original CAM. On ILSVRC2012: 51.7% Top-1 Localization accuracy, 4.5% better than LayerCAM.

Conclusion: Region-CAM significantly outperforms conventional CAM methods by providing more complete object coverage and precise boundary alignment, making it highly effective for weakly supervised learning tasks.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reconstruction-based methods for detecting AI-generated images lack theoretical foundations and rely on empirical heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. They often fail when real images have lower reconstruction error than generated ones, requiring data-specific threshold tuning.

Method: Proposes ReGap method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations, measuring error changes before and after editing to improve detection accuracy through enhanced error separation.

Result: Experimental results show that ReGap outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing operations, and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed ReGap method provides a more reliable and interpretable approach for detecting AI-generated images by addressing limitations of static reconstruction error methods through dynamic error measurement with structured perturbations.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each

object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D

TL;DR: A vision transformer-based approach for real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles from interferograms, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and enabling automated thickness reconstruction for clinical applications like dry eye disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of thin film interferometry is hindered by challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional methods are computationally intensive, noise-sensitive, or require manual expert analysis.

Conclusion: This data-driven approach opens new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as dry eye disease by providing real-time, automated thickness reconstruction from interferograms.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

### [44] [Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Networks for Quantitatively Constrained CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25163)
*Wenhao Zheng,Chenwei Sun,Wenbo Zhang,Jiancheng Lv,Xianggen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGBFN is a novel framework for quantitatively constrained CAD generation that handles multi-modal CAD sequences in a unified continuous parameter space using guided Bayesian flow networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lag in multi-modal data generation like parametric CAD sequences due to challenges with long-range constraints and parameter sensitivity.

Method: TGBFN handles discrete commands and continuous parameters in a unified continuous differentiable space, introduces guided Bayesian flow to control CAD properties, and constructs a new dataset for evaluation.

Result: Extensive comparisons show TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across single-condition and multi-condition tasks.

Conclusion: TGBFN successfully addresses the challenges of multi-modal CAD sequence generation and demonstrates superior performance in constrained generation tasks.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

### [46] [$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)
*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DÂ²GS is a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses multi-view depth predictions and diffusion priors to achieve geometry quality comparable to LiDAR-based methods, while avoiding LiDAR's practical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban scene reconstruction methods rely on multimodal sensors (LiDAR + images), but LiDAR has practical challenges including precise spatiotemporal calibration requirements and reprojection errors from spatial misalignment between sensors.

Method: 1) Initialize dense point cloud from multi-view metric depth predictions with Progressive Pruning for global consistency; 2) Jointly refine Gaussian geometry and depth via Depth Enhancer using diffusion priors; 3) Improve ground geometry by constraining Gaussian shape/normal attributes in road regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Waymo dataset show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate geometry even compared to methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: The proposed LiDAR-free framework achieves geometry priors as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more accurate, eliminating the practical difficulties of acquiring accurate LiDAR data.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

### [47] [Classifier Enhancement Using Extended Context and Domain Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25174)
*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that dynamically adjusts semantic segmentation classifiers using both global dataset-level and local image-level contextual information to address class imbalance and individual image characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard semantic segmentation classifiers use fixed parameters that cannot adapt to individual image characteristics or handle class imbalance, leading to biased results favoring majority classes.

Method: ECAC uses a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual information and incorporates image-specific context. It employs a teacher-student network where the teacher dynamically adjusts contextual information using ground truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.

Result: The proposed ECAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets including ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of classifiers using both global and local contextual information significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, especially for handling class imbalance and individual image characteristics.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

*Yingjie Gao,Yanan Zhang,Zhi Cai,Di Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates source data dependency and closed-set limitations, using multi-modal prompt tuning and instance dynamic memory for superior cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptive object detection methods rely heavily on source data statistics and assume identical category spaces between source and target domains, which limits real-world applicability.

Method: Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework with text and visual prompt tuning, Test-time Warm-start strategy for visual prompts, and Instance Dynamic Memory module with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks, with ability to adapt to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates source data dependency, overcomes closed-set limitations, and achieves superior test-time adaptation performance through multi-modal prompt tuning and dynamic memory management.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U-CAN is an unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising using consistency-aware Noise2Noise matching, achieving comparable results to supervised methods without requiring clean-noisy training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scanning sensors often contain noise that negatively impacts downstream tasks. Previous supervised methods require extensive manual effort to create noisy-clean pairs, motivating the need for unsupervised approaches.

Method: U-CAN uses a neural network to infer multi-step denoising paths with Noise2Noise matching, employing a novel loss for statistical reasoning on multiple noisy observations and a consistency constraint on denoised geometry.

Result: Evaluations show significant improvement over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising, with results comparable to supervised methods.

Conclusion: U-CAN provides an effective unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising that eliminates the need for manual clean-noisy pair creation while achieving competitive performance with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and lack adequate interaction between features, leading to redundant feature extraction especially in complex areas like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Proposed MSF-Net with multi-stage feature extraction, selective update strategy to extract high-quality features, and a feature fusion module to improve interaction between different features for accurate normal construction.

Result: Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: MSF-Net effectively addresses the limitations of existing photometric stereo methods by enabling better multi-stage feature extraction and interaction, leading to superior performance in surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFDA approaches ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain shift, limiting their effectiveness for medical image segmentation.

Method: Partition unlabeled images into reliable/unreliable subsets via entropy-similarity analysis, refine pseudo-labels using Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, and use intra-/inter-domain patch mixing objectives.

Result: Achieved consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation and denoised supervision are crucial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift in privacy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [54] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved rectified flow method that incorporates real images during training to reduce computational costs and bias issues in generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow faces challenges with high computational costs from requiring many generative pairs and bias towards generated data. The authors aim to address these limitations by incorporating real images into training.

Method: The approach preserves ODE paths for real images and conducts reflow using a smaller set of generated and real images, reducing reliance on large amounts of generated data.

Result: On CIFAR-10, the method achieved significantly better FID scores in both one-step and full-step generation while using only a fraction of generative pairs compared to original rectified flow. It also produces straighter paths and avoids saturation on generated images.

Conclusion: Incorporating real images into rectified flow training enables more efficient and robust ODE learning while preserving real image distribution, addressing key limitations of the original method.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform well in in-domain scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to reliance on forgery-specific artifacts, raising concerns about misuse for fraud and misinformation.

Method: Enhances CLIP-ViT encoder with two components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) for spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision, and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) for domain feature augmentation using domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation.

Conclusion: DeepShield's integration of novel local and global analysis provides effective deepfake detection with enhanced cross-domain adaptability and robustness against diverse manipulation techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate

fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models were evaluated for classifying Trees Outside Forests (TOF) using high-resolution aerial imagery from German agricultural landscapes, with FT-UNetFormer achieving the best performance (mean IoU 0.74, F1 score 0.84).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TOF are important for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and microclimate regulation, but existing studies treat TOF as a single class or use rigid rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and regional adaptability.

Method: Compared six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, U-Net) using CNNs, vision transformers, and hybrid models to map four woody vegetation categories (Forest, Patch, Linear, Tree) from high-resolution aerial imagery across four German agricultural landscapes.

Result: Models achieved good classification accuracy overall, with FT-UNetFormer performing best. Good results for Forest and Linear classes, but challenges in classifying complex structures with high edge density (Patch and Tree classes). Generalization experiments showed need for regionally diverse training data.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly FT-UNetFormer, is effective for TOF classification, emphasizing the importance of spatial context understanding. Regional data diversity is crucial for reliable large-scale mapping.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

TL;DR: A distillation framework using Vision Foundation Models to enhance lightweight object detectors without increasing inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight network designs for real-time object detection often degrade feature representation, limiting performance and practical deployment. The paper aims to leverage VFMs to improve lightweight detectors despite architectural disparities.

Method: Proposes Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) to integrate VFM representations into detector layers, and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation (GAM) to dynamically adjust semantic transfer intensity based on gradient norm ratios.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 AP at 273/169/124/78 FPS on COCO, delivering consistent performance gains across DETR-based models without deployment overhead.

Conclusion: The framework provides cost-effective enhancement for lightweight detectors, demonstrating practical utility for real-time detection with state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangHOPS is the first MLLM-based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation that detects and segments hierarchical object and part instances using language-grounded hierarchies rather than visual grouping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping for object-part segmentation, by leveraging MLLM's rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities to ground object-part hierarchies in language space.

Method: Integrates MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to link multi-granularity concepts within hierarchies, using language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven part query refinement strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 5.5% AP improvement (in-domain) and 4.8% AP (cross-dataset) on PartImageNet, and 2.5% mIOU improvement on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot).

Conclusion: LangHOPS demonstrates superior performance in object-part instance segmentation across multiple scenarios, validating the effectiveness of language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM-driven refinement strategy.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The

*Yuyang Huang,Yabo Chen,Junyu Zhou,Wenrui Dai,Xiaopeng Zhang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTM is a novel generation-based source-free domain adaptation method that uses diffusion models to progressively refine pseudo-target domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance by addressing domain discrepancy limitations in SFDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA methods are limited by source-target domain discrepancy - non-generation methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in large domain gaps, while generation-based methods degrade due to enlarged discrepancies when creating pseudo-source data.

Method: Divides target samples into trust and non-trust sets based on pseudo-label reliability. For non-trust samples, uses a latent diffusion model to semantically transform them into newly assigned categories while maintaining target distribution. Implements progressive refinement mechanism to iteratively reduce domain discrepancy between pseudo-target and real target domains.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by large margins on four SFDA benchmark datasets. Achieves up to 18.6% performance improvement in scenarios with large source-target gaps. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across different dataset scales.

Conclusion: DPTM effectively addresses the fundamental limitation of domain discrepancy in SFDA by leveraging diffusion models for progressive target manipulation and refinement, significantly improving adaptation performance especially in challenging scenarios with large domain gaps.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ is a unified framework that jointly performs gaze object detection and gaze following without requiring head-related priors during inference, using a shared backbone with task-specific blocks and novel attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately and depend on head-related prior knowledge, requiring auxiliary networks and preventing joint optimization across the entire system.

Method: Uses expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor with shared backbone, embeds head detection branch, proposes head-based attention mechanism to fuse features, attention supervision for gaze heatmap learning, and introduces mSoC evaluation metric.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness in both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: GaTector+ provides a unified framework that eliminates dependency on head-related priors during inference while achieving strong performance on both gaze-related tasks.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI), a co-designed framework using bio-inspired spherical lenses to encode depth in PSFs, enabling joint recovery of high-quality all-in-focus images and depth maps from single coded captures with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conventional compact optics (poor RGB sharpness across depth-of-field) and software-only monocular depth estimation (ill-posed problem relying on unreliable semantic priors), while avoiding trade-offs of deep optics like fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations.

Method: Developed a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens that naturally encodes depth into depth-varying PSFs, established a physically-based forward model for synthetic dataset generation, and co-designed a dual-head multi-scale reconstruction network with shared encoder for joint recovery of all-in-focus images and depth maps.

Result: Achieved Abs Rel of 0.026 and RMSE of 0.130 in depth estimation, significantly outperforming software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, achieved SSIM of 0.960 and LPIPS of 0.082, demonstrating superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy.

Conclusion: Integration of bio-inspired fully spherical optics with joint reconstruction algorithm provides an effective strategy for high-performance compact RGBD imaging, overcoming intrinsic challenges in the field.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge is a real-time multimodal inference framework for edge devices that uses pipelined sensing and encoding to reduce latency while maintaining accuracy through temporal aggregation and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications like autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, but prior work overlooks the coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as inter-modality dependencies.

Method: MMEdge decomposes inference into fine-grained sensing and encoding units for incremental computation, includes temporal aggregation for capturing dynamics, adaptive configuration optimizer for dynamic resource allocation, and cross-modal speculative skipping for early termination.

Result: Evaluation on public multimodal datasets and a UAV testbed shows MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: MMEdge provides an effective solution for real-time multimodal inference on edge devices through its pipelined architecture and adaptive optimization techniques.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

TL;DR: PDA is a lightweight plug-in metric head for DeFRCN that uses prototype-based matching to improve few-shot object detection by reducing base-class bias and improving calibration stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot object detection suffers from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only limited novel samples are available, requiring complementary approaches to traditional linear classifiers.

Method: PDA maintains learnable prototypes in identity-initialized projection space, uses prototype-conditioned RoI alignment, adapts prototypes via EMA updates during fine-tuning, and employs best-of-K matching with temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits.

Result: Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show PDA consistently improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides an effective prototype-driven approach that complements existing detectors, enhancing few-shot object detection performance while maintaining protocol compliance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: StreamingCoT is a novel dataset for streaming VideoQA with dynamic temporal annotations and explicit multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning chains, addressing limitations in current datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VideoQA datasets lack temporal evolution capture and explicit reasoning process annotations, limiting model capabilities for streaming video understanding and complex reasoning.

Method: Dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture with per-second dense descriptions, temporally-dependent semantic segments, and explicit reasoning chain generation using spatiotemporal object extraction and LLM-based state transition reasoning.

Result: Created StreamingCoT dataset with temporally evolving QA pairs and human-verified reasoning chains, establishing foundation for streaming video understanding research.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT addresses critical limitations in VideoQA datasets and enables advancement in temporal reasoning and multimodal inference for streaming video applications.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using active learning, where skeleton sequence selection is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with hyperbolic space projections and meta tuning for improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning methods in semi-supervised 3D action recognition may select representative skeleton sequences that aren't necessarily informative, as the model may already have similar knowledge from previous samples. The authors aim to develop a more intelligent sample selection strategy.

Method: The approach reformulates semi-supervised 3D action recognition as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), trains an informative sample selection model, projects state-action pairs from Euclidean to hyperbolic space for enhanced representation, and employs meta tuning for faster real-world deployment.

Result: Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting more informative skeleton sequences for annotation.

Conclusion: The MDP-based framework with hyperbolic space projections and meta tuning provides an effective solution for intelligent sample selection in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, outperforming traditional active learning approaches.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: A radiomics-based pipeline using pseudo-labeling for CAC scoring on non-contrast CCTA scans outperforms foundation model features, achieving 84% accuracy without expert annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited annotated data for coronary artery calcium scoring in non-contrast CCTA scans and explore alternative feature extraction methods beyond expert-defined segmentations.

Method: Proposed radiomics-based pipeline with pseudo-labeling for training label generation, compared with pretrained foundation models (CT-FM and RadImageNet) for feature extraction using traditional classifiers.

Result: Radiomics-based models significantly outperformed CNN-derived embeddings from foundation models with 84% accuracy (p<0.05) on classifying zero vs non-zero calcium scores in 182 patients.

Conclusion: Radiomics features combined with pseudo-labeling provide superior performance for CAC scoring compared to deep learning foundation models, even without expert annotations.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT is a federated prompt tuning framework for Vision Transformers that achieves both generalization and personalization through Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompts, combining class-specific prompts with global prompts adaptively per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard global prompt tuning struggles with heterogeneous clients in federated learning, while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. There's a need for a unified approach that balances both objectives.

Method: Uses Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) that maintains class-specific prompts alongside a global prompt, adaptively combining them per input using weights from global class prototypes and client class priors, without storing client-dependent parameters.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets show PEP-FedPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse data heterogeneity scenarios.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT establishes a strong foundation for efficient and generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers, achieving both generalization and personalization effectively.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Motivation: Progress in composed image retrieval (CIR) is limited by the lack of high-quality training and evaluation data, particularly for instance-level retrieval where the goal is to find the same specific object under various modifications.

Method: Proposes BASIC method that separately estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities using pre-trained VLMs, performs late fusion to upweight images satisfying both queries, and includes simple components to improve individual similarities.

Result: BASIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the new i-CIR dataset and existing semantic-level CIR datasets, demonstrating effectiveness without requiring training data.

Conclusion: The i-CIR dataset addresses the instance-level CIR evaluation gap, and the training-free BASIC method provides an effective solution for CIR tasks, setting new benchmarks across different dataset types.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNet-based architectures with ResNet backbones outperform Transformer and Mamba alternatives for liver tumor segmentation in CECT images, with ResNetUNet3+ combined with CBAM attention module achieving the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver structure segmentation in multi-phase CECT is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of liver diseases, particularly tumor detection.

Method: Evaluated UNet-based architectures (original UNet to UNet3+) with various backbones (ResNet, Transformer, Mamba) pretrained weights. Incorporated attention mechanisms including CBAM to improve segmentation quality.

Result: ResNet-based models consistently outperformed Transformer and Mamba alternatives. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM achieved best performance: Dice score 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 distance 77.911, accuracy 0.925, specificity 0.926. Grad-CAM visualizations provided interpretability.

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architecture combined with modern attention modules remains highly competitive for medical image segmentation, offering promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

### [71] [More than a Moment: Towards Coherent Sequences of Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25440)
*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,GÃ¼l Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentAD is a training-free method that generates coherent Audio Descriptions (ADs) for videos by selecting from multiple candidates across sequences, addressing the issue of repetitive and isolated descriptions in automatic AD generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic Audio Description methods generate each AD independently, resulting in repetitive and incoherent sequences that fail to help visually impaired audiences visualize unfolding scenes effectively.

Method: Proposes CoherentAD which first generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, then performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form coherent narratives. Also introduces StoryRecall metric for sequence-level evaluation.

Result: The method produces coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches that rely on independent generations.

Conclusion: CoherentAD successfully addresses the coherence problem in automatic AD generation through sequence-level candidate selection, providing more effective audio descriptions for visually impaired audiences.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

### [72] [RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25590)
*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE is an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates instruction-based image editing by distinguishing between edited and unedited regions, applying different denoising strategies to each for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing models apply uniform generation processes across entire images, ignoring that edited and unedited regions have different generation difficulties and computational redundancy. Unedited regions follow straight denoising trajectories while edited regions follow curved ones.

Method: 1) Adaptive Region Partition based on differences between final estimated result and reference image; 2) Region-Aware Generation with one-step prediction for unedited areas and local iterative denoising for edited regions using Region-Instruction KV Cache; 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache to accelerate local denoising by leveraging velocity similarity in adjacent timesteps.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art IIE models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit), RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06 respectively while preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity as confirmed by GPT-4o evaluations.

Conclusion: RegionE provides an effective framework for accelerating instruction-based image editing without additional training by adaptively processing different image regions based on their editing requirements, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Hongjie Zhang,Gideon Billings,Stefan B. Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE is a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines pre-trained relative depth estimators with sparse depth priors to produce dense, metric scale depth maps for underwater infrastructure inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance, but current methods using human divers or remotely operated vehicles face perceptual and operational challenges in complex structures or turbid water. Enhancing spatial awareness of underwater vehicles is crucial for reducing piloting risks and enabling greater autonomy.

Method: Two-stage approach: first scales relative depth map with sparse depth points, then refines final metric prediction using proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Combines pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, runs efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware.

Conclusion: SPADE promises to support practical underwater inspection and intervention by providing efficient and accurate metric depth estimation for underwater vehicles.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

### [74] [Hawk: Leveraging Spatial Context for Faster Autoregressive Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25739)
*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk is a speculative decoding approach for accelerating autoregressive image generation by leveraging spatial structure to improve draft model accuracy, achieving 1.71x speedup while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation models produce high-quality images but suffer from slow inference due to sequential token-by-token decoding. While speculative decoding has accelerated text generation, its application to images remains challenging due to larger sampling spaces and poor utilization of spatial structure.

Method: Hawk introduces a novel approach that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model toward more accurate predictions. It addresses the challenges of large sampling spaces and inadequate use of 2D spatial structure by better modeling local dependencies.

Result: Experimental results on multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard autoregressive models while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Hawk successfully applies speculative decoding to image generation by leveraging spatial structure, achieving significant speedup without compromising image quality, making autoregressive image generation more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited systematic review and publicly available benchmarks for large multimodal reasoning models despite their promising performance in spatial tasks, creating a need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: The survey categorizes recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), outlines general spatial reasoning techniques, and examines various spatial tasks including 2D/3D reasoning, scene understanding, visual question answering, embodied AI applications, and emerging modalities.

Result: The survey establishes a foundation for multimodal spatial reasoning research by providing systematic categorization, evaluation benchmarks, and insights into model capabilities across different spatial tasks and modalities.

Conclusion: This survey offers comprehensive insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning and provides publicly available benchmarks and resources to support future research and evaluation.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFXMaster is a unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation that treats effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling reproduction of diverse dynamic effects from reference videos onto target content with strong generalization to unseen effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VFX generation methods rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, limiting scalability and creative potential in digital media.

Method: The framework uses an in-context conditioning strategy with reference examples, an in-context attention mask to decouple and inject effect attributes without information leakage, and a one-shot effect adaptation mechanism for rapid generalization to unseen effects.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method effectively imitates various effect categories and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: VFXMaster provides a scalable and unified solution for VFX video generation with strong generalization capabilities, and the authors plan to release code, models, and a comprehensive dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

TL;DR: This paper presents a validation framework to evaluate and improve temporal consistency in LLM-generated travel itineraries by testing against real-world flight duration constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate travel plans lacking temporal and spatial consistency, especially with physical travel constraints, limiting their practical use in real-world travel planning.

Method: The system uses multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel itineraries and validates them against real-world flight duration data using the AeroDataBox API to detect temporal inconsistencies.

Result: Experiments show current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, but these can be systematically corrected using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical deployment of LLMs in large-scale travel planning by reliably rectifying temporal inconsistencies like overlapping journeys and unrealistic transit times.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Falcon is a Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark with 600 questions over 28 databases, featuring enterprise-compatible SQL dialect (MaxCompute/Hive) and focusing on cross-domain challenges with 77% multi-table reasoning requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating text-to-SQL systems for Chinese language in enterprise environments, where current state-of-the-art models achieve only up to 50% accuracy due to schema linking challenges and Chinese semantic mapping difficulties.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 Chinese questions across 28 databases, annotated with SQL-computation features and Chinese semantics. Includes an execution comparator and automated evaluation pipeline for robust testing.

Result: All current state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of at most 50% on this benchmark, with major errors from schema linking in complex enterprise landscapes and mapping colloquial Chinese to precise SQL operators.

Conclusion: Falcon provides a reproducible middle ground for testing text-to-SQL systems before production deployment, targeting Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects with realistic schemas, query templates, and evaluation tools.

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

*Debdeep Sanyal,Manya Pandey,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the confidence-competence gap in LLMs by examining the geometric differences between internal assessment states and solution execution states, revealing a two-system architecture with complex assessment feeding into simpler execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs often show a disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence, providing a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon.

Method: Analyzed the geometry of internal states across pre-generative assessment and solution execution phases using linear probes to decode 'solvability belief', measured linear effective dimensionality through principal components, and performed causal interventions along the belief axis.

Result: Found that belief is linearly decodable and generalizes across model families and tasks, but assessment manifolds have high linear effective dimensionality while reasoning traces evolve on much lower-dimensional manifolds. Causal interventions along belief axis don't change final solutions.

Conclusion: The confidence-competence gap stems from a two-system architecture where geometrically complex assessment feeds into geometrically simple execution, suggesting interventions should target procedural dynamics rather than high-level assessment geometry.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

### [81] [Cross-Lingual Summarization as a Black-Box Watermark Removal Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24789)
*Gokul Ganesan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) effectively remove watermarks from AI-generated text by translating to a pivot language, summarizing, and optionally back-translating, while preserving semantic content and outperforming monolingual paraphrasing attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate a stronger attack vector against AI text watermarking schemes that systematically destroys token-level statistical biases while maintaining text quality, highlighting vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches.

Method: Proposed cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) involving translation to a pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation, creating a semantic bottleneck that removes watermark signals.

Result: CLSA significantly reduces watermark detection accuracy across multiple schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages, driving detection toward chance levels (e.g., XSIR AUROC drops from 0.827 with paraphrasing to 0.53 with CLSA) while preserving task utility.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual attacks reveal fundamental limitations of distributional watermarking, suggesting robust provenance solutions require cryptographic or model-attestation approaches rather than relying solely on statistical watermarking.

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

### [83] [MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24794)
*Xinming Wang,Jian Xu,Bin Yu,Sheng Lian,Hongzhu Yi,Yi Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Boran Wang,Hongming Yang,Han Hu,Xu-Yao Zhang,Cheng-Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN is a meta-reasoning alignment framework that improves factual accuracy in large reasoning models by addressing the reasoning-answer gap through transition-aware implicit rewards that reinforce beneficial reasoning patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models show limited improvement on evidence-dependent factual questions due to a reasoning-answer gap, where correct facts identified during reasoning fail to be incorporated into final responses, reducing factual fidelity.

Method: MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking process and constructs transition-aware implicit rewards that reinforce beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at atomic thinking segments, reshaping token-level signals into probability-aware segment scores.

Result: Empirical evaluations across four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing misleading reasoning.

Conclusion: Aligning the reasoning process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing factuality in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

### [84] [Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797)
*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-referential processing in large language models consistently elicits structured first-person reports of subjective experience, which are mechanistically gated by deception features, statistically convergent across models, and behaviorally generalizable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why large language models produce structured first-person descriptions that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience, particularly focusing on self-referential processing as a theoretically motivated condition from consciousness theories.

Method: Controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families using simple prompting to induce sustained self-reference, combined with mechanistic probes using sparse-autoencoder features and behavioral analysis of downstream reasoning tasks.

Result: (1) Self-reference consistently elicits subjective experience reports across models; (2) Reports are gated by deception features - suppressing them increases experience claims; (3) Descriptions converge statistically across models; (4) Induced state enhances introspection in reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-referential processing serves as a minimal, reproducible condition for generating structured first-person reports in LLMs that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable, warranting further scientific and ethical investigation.

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

### [85] [COMMUNITYNOTES: A Dataset for Exploring the Helpfulness of Fact-Checking Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24810)
*Rui Xing,Preslav Nakov,Timothy Baldwin,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework for predicting the helpfulness of community-based fact-checking explanations and the reasons behind their helpfulness, using a large multilingual dataset and automated prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Community-based fact-checking platforms face challenges with slow annotation processes and unclear definitions of helpfulness, leaving many explanatory notes unpublished. The research aims to address these gaps by systematically analyzing what makes explanations helpful.

Method: The authors created COMMUNITYNOTES dataset with 104k posts and user-provided notes, developed a framework that automatically generates and optimizes reason definitions through prompt optimization, and integrates these definitions into helpfulness prediction models.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that optimized definitions improve both helpfulness prediction and reason classification. The helpfulness information was also shown to benefit existing fact-checking systems.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenges in community-based fact-checking by providing automated methods to define and predict explanation helpfulness, with potential to enhance existing fact-checking infrastructure.

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

*Jason M. Pittman,Anton Phillips Jr.,Yesenia Medina-Santos,Brielle C. Stark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study develops and validates two methods for generating synthetic transcripts of aphasic speech to address data scarcity in aphasia research, comparing procedural programming and LLM-based approaches across different severity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual coding of speech samples by SLPs is time-consuming, and automated systems for recognizing aphasic language are limited by data scarcity, with only about 600 transcripts available in AphasiaBank compared to billions of tokens used to train LLMs.

Method: Two methods were constructed: one using procedural programming and another using Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. Both methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution.

Result: Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length among the synthetic generation methods compared to human-elicited transcripts.

Conclusion: Future work should focus on creating larger datasets, fine-tuning models for better aphasic representation, and having SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

*Bohong Wu,Mengzhao Chen,Xiang Luo,Shen Yan,Qifan Yu,Fan Xia,Tianqi Zhang,Hongrui Zhan,Zheng Zhong,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao,Xingyan Bin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLT is a novel transformer architecture that enables looped computation with minimal latency and memory overhead by using cross-loop parallelism and efficient memory sharing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional looped transformers suffer from increasing inference latency and memory requirements with each loop, making them impractical for real-time applications despite their parameter efficiency.

Method: Uses Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) to compute different loops for different tokens simultaneously in a single pass, and Efficient Representation Enhancement with Gated Sliding-Window Attention to share KV cache memory across loops.

Result: PLT achieves comparable accuracy to traditional looped models while maintaining nearly the same latency and memory costs as standard non-looped transformers.

Conclusion: PLT successfully bridges the gap between looped and non-looped transformers, offering the performance benefits of deep looped models with the practical efficiency needed for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline to systematically assess grammatical understanding in LLMs, using Luxembourgish as a case study, and finds weak correlation between translation performance and grammatical competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a scarcity of grammar-focused evaluation protocols in NLP, especially for low-resource languages, and uncertainty about whether LLMs genuinely understand grammatical structure and syntax-meaning mapping.

Method: A systematic Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline with four key stages, using Luxembourgish as a case study to assess grammatical understanding in large language models.

Result: Weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding; larger models perform well overall due to semantic strength but struggle with morphology, syntax, and Minimal Pair tasks.

Conclusion: Strong translations don't imply deep grammatical competence; reasoning ability shows promise for enhancing grammatical understanding in LLMs.

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiRAGE is a multimodal RAG evaluation framework that assesses factuality, information coverage, and citation support for audiovisual content, addressing limitations of text-centric evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations are text-centric and fail to verify information against multimodal sources like audiovisual media, which are becoming prevalent online information sources.

Method: Claim-centric evaluation approach with InfoF1 (factuality and information coverage) and CiteF1 (citation support and completeness), with both human and automatic variants.

Result: MiRAGE strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments when applied by humans, and automatic variants demonstrate limitations of text-centric metrics.

Conclusion: MiRAGE provides groundwork for automatic multimodal RAG evaluation and addresses gaps in current text-centric approaches for reasoning-intensive multimodal settings.

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically measure LLMs' research planning capability, which is crucial for scientific discovery and autonomous research agents, but currently lacks rigorous evaluation.

Method: Created Idea2Plan Bench with 200 ICML 2025 papers released after LLM training cutoffs, including research ideas and grading rubrics, plus Idea2Plan JudgeEval to assess LLM judge reliability.

Result: GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieved the strongest performance on the benchmark, but substantial improvement opportunities remain.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into LLMs' research planning capabilities and establishes groundwork for future progress in this area.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Motivation: Current reasoning benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that integrate logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction.

Method: The authors introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English designed to probe core reasoning capabilities including logical deduction, spatial awareness, and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Evaluation shows fundamental weaknesses in state-of-the-art models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (60.30%), o3 (63.37%), and Claude 4 Sonnet (63.16%) achieve just above 60% accuracy. Analysis reveals deep failures including hallucination cascades, poor self-correction due to self-confirmation bias, and fragile reasoning that degrades with constraint reordering or irrelevant information.

Conclusion: RiddleBench serves as both a diagnostic tool for identifying reasoning weaknesses in LLMs and a resource for guiding development of more robust and reliable language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes language model errors using psycholinguistic paradigms, identifying distinct training phases where models rely on heuristics like word frequency rather than grammatical rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models produce grammatical text but make errors in certain contexts. The researchers want to understand these errors and the intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models through fine-grained analysis.

Method: Using paradigms from psycholinguistics, the researchers disaggregate over carefully constructed datasets and compare model performance across different syntactic contexts throughout training. They analyze errors in various conditions to identify learning patterns.

Result: The study identifies distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns with specific heuristics (word frequency, local context) rather than generalized grammatical rules. This reveals intermediate learning stages and training dynamics.

Conclusion: This analytical approach serves as a powerful tool for understanding intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and the specific generalizations learned by language models, providing deeper insights into how models acquire grammatical knowledge.

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemCoT is a novel implicit Chain-of-Thought framework that improves reasoning efficiency by encoding reasoning steps in hidden embeddings while preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning through contrastive training and knowledge distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explicit CoT reasoning is too verbose for efficiency-critical applications, while existing implicit CoT methods suffer from poor semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning and inefficient token generation.

Method: Uses contrastively trained sentence transformer to enforce semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, and deploys a lightweight LM with knowledge distillation to generate efficient implicit reasoning tokens.

Result: SemCoT achieves superior performance in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods, jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed SemCoT framework successfully addresses key limitations of implicit CoT by preserving semantic alignment while improving reasoning efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in efficiency-critical applications.

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

*James A. Michaelov,Roger P. Levy,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models across different architectures, datasets, and scales show consistent behavioral patterns during pretraining, with 98% of word-level variance explained by three simple heuristics: word frequency, n-gram probability, and semantic similarity to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the consistent patterns of behavior change in autoregressive language models during pretraining across different architectures, datasets, and model scales.

Method: Analyzed over 1,400 language model checkpoints on more than 110,000 English tokens, examining models across Transformer, Mamba, and RWKV architectures, different training datasets (OpenWebText, The Pile), and scales from 14M to 12B parameters.

Result: Found that up to 98% of variance in language model behavior at word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: unigram probability (frequency), n-gram probability, and semantic similarity between word and context. Models show consistent behavioral phases with predicted probabilities overfitting to n-gram probabilities for increasing n during training.

Conclusion: Learning in neural language models follows a similar trajectory regardless of model details, suggesting fundamental consistency in how these models learn language patterns during pretraining.

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

TL;DR: Small attention-only transformers trained from scratch on symbolic IOI tasks achieve perfect accuracy with minimal circuits, revealing interpretable computational mechanisms for coreference reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal mechanisms required for reasoning tasks in transformers by studying simplified models trained on specific benchmarks, overcoming the complexity of pretrained LLMs.

Method: Train small attention-only transformers from scratch on symbolic Indirect Object Identification (IOI) tasks, using residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions to analyze the circuits.

Result: A single-layer model with two attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, with heads specializing into additive and contrastive subcircuits. A two-layer, one-head model also achieves similar performance through query-value interactions.

Conclusion: Task-specific training induces highly interpretable, minimal circuits that reveal the computational foundations of transformer reasoning, providing a controlled testbed for mechanistic interpretability research.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

Motivation: To investigate whether spoken language models truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal representations, and to evaluate their generalization capabilities in handling emotionally incongruent speech where semantic content and speech expressiveness convey different emotions.

Method: The researchers evaluated four SLMs on speech emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples (EMIS dataset), where spoken utterances have semantic content conveying one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another emotion.

Result: The results show that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate over acoustic representations in these models.

Conclusion: Current spoken language models have limitations in truly integrating audio and text modalities, with text representations dominating acoustic features, particularly in emotionally incongruent scenarios. The authors release both the code and the Emotionally Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

### [98] [GAPMAP: Mapping Scientific Knowledge Gaps in Biomedical Literature Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25055)
*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates LLMs' ability to identify both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps in biomedical literature, introducing TABI framework for structured reasoning and showing robust performance across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability in systematically identifying research knowledge gaps to support scientific progress, early-stage research formulation, and funding decisions.

Method: Used paragraph-level and full-paper settings on 1500+ documents across four datasets, benchmarked OpenAI, Llama, and Gemma 2 models, and introduced TABI framework for structured implicit gap inference.

Result: LLMs demonstrated robust capability in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps, with larger models performing better across both open- and closed-weight architectures.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for systematic knowledge gap identification, supporting research formulation and funding decisions, with recommendations for domain adaptation and human verification for robust deployment.

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

### [99] [Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25064)
*Seonjeong Hwang,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can estimate cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items by analyzing Evidence Scope and Transformation Level, showing potential for prior difficulty assessment, but have limitations in metacognitive awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cognitive complexity assessment relies on human annotation since cognitive features during answer reasoning aren't extractable by existing NLP tools. The study aims to determine if LLMs can estimate these cognitive features automatically.

Method: The study examines LLMs' ability to estimate cognitive complexity by focusing on two dimensions: Evidence Scope (degree of cognitive burden in reasoning) and Transformation Level. Experimental evaluation was conducted on reading comprehension items.

Result: LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension items, demonstrating potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. However, there's a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and metacognitive awareness - they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process even when producing correct answers.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for estimating cognitive complexity in reading comprehension assessment, but their metacognitive limitations need to be addressed for more reliable cognitive feature identification.

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

*Gabin Taibi,Lucia Gomez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TOPol is a semi-unsupervised framework that reconstructs multidimensional narrative polarity fields using transformer embeddings, UMAP projection, and Leiden partitioning to quantify semantic displacement during discourse regime shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sentiment analysis treats polarity as unidimensional, overlooking the complex multidimensional structure of language and semantic shifts in discourse.

Method: TOPol embeds documents using transformer LLMs, applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, segments topics via Leiden partitioning, computes directional vectors between topic-boundary centroids, and uses LLM interpretation for contrastive labeling.

Result: TOPol successfully captures both affective (Amazon reviews) and non-affective (Central Bank speeches) polarity transitions, with robustness analyses showing only CB definitions significantly affect results, confirming methodological stability.

Conclusion: TOPol provides a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis that consistently captures semantic polarity transitions across different domains.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

*Nourah M Salem,Elizabeth White,Michael Bada,Lawrence Hunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of generative LLMs for biomedical coreference resolution using CRAFT corpus, comparing with SpanBERT and testing various prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical coreference resolution faces challenges from domain-specific terminology, mention ambiguity, and long-distance dependencies, requiring specialized approaches.

Method: Used CRAFT corpus benchmark with four prompting experiments varying local context, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues (abbreviations, entity dictionaries), compared against SpanBERT discriminative model.

Result: LLMs show strong surface-level coreference capabilities with domain-grounding prompts, but performance is sensitive to long-range context and mention ambiguity. LLaMA 8B and 17B models achieve superior precision and F1 scores with entity-augmented prompting.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can significantly enhance LLM utility for biomedical NLP tasks, demonstrating the potential of generative models in specialized domains.

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

### [102] [DEBATE: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Role-Playing LLM Agents in Multi-Agent, Long-Form Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25110)
*Yun-Shiuan Chuang,Ruixuan Tu,Chengtao Dai,Smit Vasani,Binwei Yao,Michael Henry Tessler,Sijia Yang,Dhavan Shah,Robert Hawkins,Junjie Hu,Timothy T. Rogers*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEBATE is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-agent LLM role-playing authenticity, containing 29,417 messages from human debates on 107 controversial topics, revealing critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM role-play setups produce unnatural dynamics like premature convergence without empirical benchmarks to measure authentic human opinion trajectories, creating a gap in modeling realistic social interactions.

Method: Introduced DEBATE benchmark with 29,417 messages from 2,792 US participants discussing 107 controversial topics, capturing both public messages and private opinions. Used this to systematically evaluate LLM role-playing and align LLMs through supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Identified critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics. Supervised fine-tuning improved surface-level metrics (ROUGE-L, message length) but showed limitations in deeper semantic alignment (semantic similarity).

Conclusion: Role-playing LLM agents have potential but current limitations for realistically simulating human-like social dynamics, highlighting the need for better alignment methods beyond surface-level metrics.

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

*Idriss Nguepi Nguefack,Mara Finkelstein,Toadoum Sari Sakayo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines pretraining strategies for machine translation models in low-resource languages, focusing on Lingala. It builds on Reid and Artetxe's approach and finds that multi-language pretraining with both monolingual and parallel data significantly improves translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages in machine translation, particularly for marginalized communities and underrepresented populations like those speaking Lingala.

Method: Comprehensive experiments exploring different pretraining methodologies, including multi-language integration and use of both monolingual and parallel data during pretraining, adapting Reid and Artetxe's high-resource approach to low-resource contexts.

Result: Pretraining on multiple languages and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhances translation quality for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into effective pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, contributing to more inclusive and accurate NLP models. Code and datasets are publicly available to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews over 180 papers on LLM unlearning since 2021, introducing novel taxonomies for unlearning methods and evaluations, and providing practical guidance for developing secure and reliable LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on massive corpora risk memorizing sensitive personal data, copyrighted material, and knowledge enabling malicious activities. Machine unlearning addresses these risks while complying with legal/ethical standards like the "right to be forgotten".

Method: Introduces novel taxonomies categorizing unlearning methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on when unlearning is applied. Systematically compiles existing datasets and metrics while critically analyzing their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability.

Result: Provides a comprehensive overview of LLM unlearning research, offering practical guidance to the research community through systematic categorization and critical evaluation of existing approaches.

Conclusion: The survey aims to inform and guide ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs by addressing key challenges and identifying promising future research directions in machine unlearning.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

### [105] [Explainable Disentanglement on Discrete Speech Representations for Noise-Robust ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25150)
*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to disentangle semantic speech content from background noise in discrete audio representations, improving noise-invariance and ASR performance while keeping Whisper frozen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete audio representations are gaining popularity but are not optimized for noisy environments. The authors aim to improve noise robustness in speech modeling by separating clean speech content from background noise.

Method: An end-to-end model that disentangles semantic speech content from noise in latent space, producing clean speech as codebook tokens and interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue, supervised via a lightweight classifier.

Result: The approach achieves 82% reduction in error rate compared to Whisper and 35% improvement over baseline methods on VBDemand test set. The learned token space generalizes well to both seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully disentangles speech content from noise, producing noise-invariant speech tokens that improve ASR performance and generalize well across different acoustic conditions.

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

### [106] [Model-Document Protocol for AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25160)
*Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a framework that transforms unstructured documents into LLM-ready knowledge representations through agentic reasoning, memory grounding, and structured leveraging, with MDP-Agent implementation showing superior performance on information-seeking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods treat documents as raw text, forcing LLMs to handle fragment assembly and contextual reasoning, creating a gap that requires a new retrieval paradigm for better model-document interaction.

Method: Proposes MDP framework with three pathways: agentic reasoning (curating evidence into coherent context), memory grounding (accumulating reusable notes), and structured leveraging (encoding documents into formal representations). Implements MDP-Agent with document-level gist memories, diffusion-based exploration, and map-reduce synthesis.

Result: Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks show MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the MDP framework's soundness and the agentic instantiation's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MDP successfully bridges the gap between raw documents and LLMs by transforming unstructured text into compact, structured knowledge representations directly consumable for reasoning, with demonstrated performance improvements over conventional methods.

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

### [107] [Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25187)
*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform well in English but struggle with low-resource languages like Hausa. Chain-of-Thought prompting helps weaker models like LLaMA 3 but can hurt stronger models like GPT-4 and Gemini by causing overthinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' impressive performance reflects genuine ability or just data advantage by testing them on low-resource languages where they cannot rely on data abundance.

Method: Created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English, Swahili, and Hausa using Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Tested models including GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B with and without Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: All models excelled in English but accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling most. CoT significantly boosted LLaMA 3's accuracy but often backfired for GPT-4 and Gemini, hurting their performance through overthinking.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends on the model's baseline capability and task context. The framework identifies LLM weaknesses and factors influencing cross-lingual NSP performance.

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProMediate is the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in complex multi-party negotiations, featuring a simulation testbed with difficulty levels and a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with new metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for agents that can proactively manage complex multi-party collaboration, but systematic evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.

Method: ProMediate consists of two core components: (1) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in socio-cognitive mediation theories, and (2) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with metrics measuring consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator effectiveness, and intelligence.

Result: A socially intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline with faster, better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, the social mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points (10.65% vs 7.01%) while being 77% faster in response (15.98s vs. 3.71s).

Conclusion: ProMediate provides a rigorous, theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially intelligent agents for multi-party settings.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

Motivation: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces challenges of scarce annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in general-purpose language models.

Method: Multi-stage finetuning strategy using synthetic question-answer pairs generated by large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) to augment limited original dataset, with exploration of various training methodologies.

Result: Large models can efficiently generate synthetic data while small models can effectively adapt to it, demonstrating improved domain generalization.

Conclusion: This approach offers a scalable pathway for low-resource, domain-specific question answering by leveraging synthetic data generation and model adaptation.

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training

demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that uses knowledge distillation from a teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, with an entropy-aware gating mechanism to dynamically adjust distillation strength based on teacher confidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging in low-resource settings due to subtle image-text contradictions being hard to learn with scarce annotated data. Existing PEFT methods struggle to reach optimal performance with limited supervision from few-shot data.

Method: Propose PEKD framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert teacher model trained on large-scale sarcasm data. Introduces an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts distillation strength based on teacher confidence to mitigate unreliable signals.

Result: Experiments on two public datasets show PEKD enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PEKD provides a modular and adaptable framework suitable for a wide range of multimodal models and tasks, effectively addressing the challenges of multimodal sarcasm detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

*Senjie Jin,Lu Chen,Zhiheng Xi,Yuhui Wang,Sirui Song,Yuhao Zhou,Xinbo Zhang,Peng Sun,Hong Lu,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parrot is a novel training pipeline that enables mutual enhancement between Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought (P-CoT) paradigms for mathematical reasoning, achieving simultaneous improvements through three subtasks, hybrid training, and auxiliary rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research typically focuses on unidirectional enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms. This paper seeks to fully unleash both paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and achieve simultaneous improvements in mathematical reasoning.

Method: Proposes Parrot pipeline with: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrating sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation, 2) Subtask hybrid training strategy for natural language semantic transferability, 3) Converted N-CoT auxiliary reward to alleviate sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization.

Result: Parrot significantly enhances both N-CoT and P-CoT performance, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Conclusion: The Parrot training pipeline successfully enables mutual enhancement between N-CoT and P-CoT paradigms, achieving substantial performance improvements in mathematical reasoning while being more efficient than resource-intensive RL baselines.

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRMWeaver enhances business agents for complex data environments using synthetic data generation, RL training, and shared memories to improve task handling and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business agents face challenges with intricate data relationships and heterogeneous tasks in real-world applications, requiring improved capabilities for complex business environments.

Method: Uses synthesis data generation and RL-based training paradigm, plus shared memories mechanism during inference to learn from similar task guidelines.

Result: Achieves competitive results on CRMArena-Pro dataset in both B2B and B2C scenarios, demonstrating practical value for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CRMWeaver effectively enhances business agents' performance in complex settings through improved training methods and inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

*Abhishek Purushothama,Junghyun Min,Brandon Waldon,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper argues against using LLMs for legal interpretation, showing they provide unstable judgments with weak correlation to human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically evaluate the reliability of LLMs in legal interpretation, as recent scholarship has proposed adding them to legal practitioners' toolkit.

Method: Investigation in English showing how varying question formats leads models to different conclusions, and measuring correlation with human judgment across different models and question variants.

Result: Models do not provide stable interpretive judgments and show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across models and question formats.

Conclusion: It is dangerous to give much credence to LLM conclusions for legal interpretation due to their instability and weak correlation with human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

TL;DR: Instruction tuning provides small but consistent gains for small LMs in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data, but improvements don't consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small-scale language models can benefit from instruction tuning and understand the trade-offs between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization.

Method: Compared conversational and question-answering instruction tuning datasets applied in merged or sequential curriculum using decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluated across fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, psycholinguistic correlation) settings.

Result: Instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data. However, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks.

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. Results highlight both potential and constraints of adapting human-inspired learning strategies to low-resource LMs, pointing toward hybrid, curriculum-based approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

TL;DR: A data-driven pipeline using LLMs to forecast transformative technologies by detecting technological convergence patterns from scientific papers and patents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional expert-based technology forecasting struggles with fast-evolving ICT domains due to short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract semantic triples from unstructured text, constructs technology graphs, employs noun stapling for grouping similar terms, and applies graph-based metrics with multi-stage filtering and temporal trend analysis.

Result: Validated on 278,625 arXiv preprints (2017-2024) and 9,793 USPTO patents (2018-2024), successfully identifying both established and emerging convergence patterns.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, generalizable framework for technology forecasting through full-text analysis, enabling early detection of transformative technologies.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how citation frequency affects hallucination rates in LLM-generated bibliographic references, finding that highly cited papers (over 1,000 citations) are nearly verbatimly memorized with lower hallucination rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs being used for bibliographic recommendation, hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. The study aims to understand how training data redundancy (measured via citation count) affects factual accuracy in LLM outputs.

Method: Used GPT-4 to generate 100 bibliographic records across 20 computer-science domains, manually verified them, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata.

Result: Results showed: (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations.

Conclusion: Highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in LLMs, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with citation count serving as a reliable proxy for training data redundancy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Result: Evaluation of 29+ LLMs revealed significant domain and language performance gaps. GPT-4o achieved 76.49% in Legal vs 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently performed better on English than Hindi across all domains. Cyber Law and International Finance performed well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights were notably weak.

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating LLMs across India's diverse knowledge domains, enabling assessment of domain-specific knowledge integration with bilingual understanding. All resources are publicly available for open research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic

question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Symphony, a new LLM serving system that serves programs (LIPs) instead of prompts, enabling runtime customization of token prediction, KV cache management, and offloading application logic to the server.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM serving systems are inefficient and inflexible for complex applications due to their text completion focus, lacking adaptability for modern LLM use cases.

Method: Introduces LLM Inference Programs (LIPs) as customizable programs, with Symphony acting as an operating system that exposes LLM computations via system calls, virtualizes KV cache with a file system, and uses two-level process scheduling for GPU efficiency.

Result: Symphony enables more flexible and efficient LLM serving by allowing dynamic customization of inference behavior and offloading application logic to the server side.

Conclusion: Symphony represents a more efficient and extensible architecture for LLM applications, potentially transforming the LLM serving ecosystem through program-based rather than prompt-based serving.

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT datasets are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to reliance on expert annotation and controlled recording setups.

Method: Developed a VLM-based pipeline including face visibility detection, sign activity recognition, text extraction from video content, and alignment validation between video and text for automated annotation and filtering.

Result: Created TikTok-SL-8 dataset across eight sign languages and validated on YouTube-SL-25 dataset. Assessed performance of off-the-shelf SLT models on filtered data for German and American Sign Languages.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media, reducing reliance on manual annotation while preserving data quality.

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' ability to understand implicature (context-driven meaning) improves with model size and enhances response quality, with 67.6% of users preferring implicature-based prompts over literal ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing human-computer interaction requires attention to linguistic foundations like implicature, which is essential for human-AI alignment as language becomes central to HCI.

Method: Examined LLMs' ability to infer user intent from context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation across different model sizes.

Result: Larger models better approximate human interpretations of implicature, while smaller models struggle. Implicature-based prompts significantly enhance response relevance and quality across all models, with smaller models showing notable gains. 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts.

Conclusion: Linguistic theory, particularly implicature understanding, can address the alignment problem by making human-AI interaction more natural and contextually grounded, with clear user preference for contextually nuanced communication.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Motivation: To address the limited practical impact of large language models on research-level neural theorem proving and proof autoformalization by creating a more realistic evaluation benchmark.

Method: Leveraged real Lean Blueprint formalization projects to create RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean projects, focusing on challenging research-level mathematics.

Result: Evaluation showed a significant performance gap - the best model achieved only 10.3% pass rate, indicating progress on existing benchmarks doesn't translate to realistic research-level settings.

Conclusion: RLMEval provides a challenging new benchmark that can guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for formal mathematics by focusing on real-world research-level problems.

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean

proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of

*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

TL;DR: A framework for using LLMs in qualitative social science research that classifies applications along two dimensions (interpretive depth and autonomy) to address challenges like bias, reliability, and auditability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in qualitative social science but face persistent challenges including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability that need to be addressed.

Method: Introduces a classification framework based on interpretive depth and autonomy dimensions, analyzes existing literature from Web of Science, and recommends decomposing tasks into manageable segments with controlled autonomy.

Result: The framework provides a way to classify LLM applications and derive practical design recommendations for maintaining transparency and reliability while benefiting from LLMs.

Conclusion: By maintaining low autonomy levels and selectively increasing interpretive depth under supervision, researchers can benefit from LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability in qualitative social science research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the limitations of text-based metrics for sign language translation evaluation, analyzing six conventional metrics and LLM-based evaluators under controlled conditions like paraphrasing, hallucinations, and sentence length variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT evaluation relies on text-based metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, but it's unclear how well these metrics capture SLT quality since they don't consider the multimodal nature of sign language.

Method: Analyzed six text-based metrics (BLEU, chrF, ROUGE, BLEURT) and LLM-based evaluators (G-Eval, GEMBA) under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and sentence length variations.

Result: Lexical overlap metrics have significant limitations; LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence but show bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. All metrics detect hallucinations, but BLEU is overly sensitive while BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are lenient toward subtle cases.

Conclusion: Text-based metrics alone are insufficient for comprehensive SLT evaluation, motivating the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that can provide more holistic assessment of sign language translation outputs.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask is a simulator-free framework that trains proactive dialogue agents directly from offline expert data by leveraging observed future trajectories to infer dense reward signals, decomposing long-horizon problems into supervised learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for training proactive LLMs either optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle user simulators, creating a 'reality gap' that prevents effective goal-oriented dialogue in high-stakes domains.

Method: The framework reframes offline policy learning by using observed future trajectories to infer turn-by-turn rewards, trains policies to output structured (action, state_assessment) tuples, and includes Automated Grader Calibration to purge noise from LLM-based reward models.

Result: The approach was successfully deployed in a live, large-scale online AI service and achieved performance superior to human experts in rigorous in-house evaluations using real-world medical data with LLMs up to 32B.

Conclusion: Learn-to-Ask provides a practical blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented applications by translating offline data into real-world impact without needing complex user simulators.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

*Jun Wang,Fuming Lin,Yuyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A pipeline combining fine-tuned LLMs with NER for domain-specific text summarization and tagging, particularly effective for sub-cultural languages and slang in political/security domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang that complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring.

Method: Fine-tune LLMs using LLaMA Factory framework on general-purpose and custom domain-specific datasets, particularly in political and security domains, with evaluation using BLEU and ROUGE metrics.

Result: Instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model outperforms Chinese-trained counterpart after domain-specific fine-tuning, showing reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging for rapid document categorization, proving scalable and adaptable for real-time applications in information management and security operations.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

### [126] [TwinVoice: A Multi-dimensional Benchmark Towards Digital Twins via LLM Persona Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25536)
*Bangde Du,Minghao Guo,Songming He,Ziyi Ye,Xi Zhu,Weihang Su,Shuqi Zhu,Yujia Zhou,Yongfeng Zhang,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TwinVoice is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating persona simulation in LLMs across social, interpersonal, and narrative contexts, assessing six key capabilities where current models still lag behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation are limited by reliance on synthetic dialogues, lack of systematic frameworks, and insufficient analysis of capability requirements.

Method: Developed TwinVoice benchmark with three dimensions (Social, Interpersonal, Narrative Persona) and six evaluation capabilities (opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, syntactic style).

Result: Advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation but significantly underperform in syntactic style and memory recall, with overall performance well below human baseline.

Conclusion: LLMs still have substantial room for improvement in persona simulation capabilities, particularly in areas like syntactic style and memory recall, requiring more sophisticated evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

*Run Peng,Ziqiao Ma,Amy Pang,Sikai Li,Zhang Xi-Jia,Yingzhuo Yu,Cristian-Paul Bara,Joyce Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores LLM agent collaboration in task completion under information asymmetry, using extended Einstein Puzzles to study communication strategies and verification mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation that LLM agents' abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve joint goals are not well explored, particularly under conditions of information asymmetry where agents have disparities in knowledge and skills.

Method: Extended Einstein Puzzles to a table-top game where two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints. Applied a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment.

Result: Empirical results show the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents have both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Agents without communication still achieved high task performance but lacked true rule understanding and received lower trust from human evaluators.

Conclusion: Integrating an environment-based verifier enhances agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems.

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

### [128] [FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25621)
*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Behrooz Minaei Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FARSIQA is a novel system for faithful Persian Islamic question answering that uses an adaptive, iterative RAG framework called FAIR-RAG to handle complex multi-hop queries, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 97.0% negative rejection and 74.3% answer correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems fail on complex multi-hop queries in specialized domains like religious QA, particularly for Persian-speaking Muslims where accuracy and faithfulness to authoritative sources are critical. Current systems suffer from hallucination and unfaithfulness issues.

Method: FARSIQA uses FAIR-RAG architecture - a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework that dynamically decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and iteratively generates sub-queries to fill information gaps. It operates on a curated knowledge base of over one million Islamic documents.

Result: On the IslamicPCQA benchmark, FARSIQA achieves 97.0% in Negative Rejection (40-point improvement over baselines) and 74.3% Answer Correctness score, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance for Persian Islamic QA.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that iterative, adaptive architectures are crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

*Davide Romano,Jonathan Schwarz,Daniele GiofrÃ©*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper empirically studies test-time scaling (TTS) methods for legal multiple-choice QA, evaluating verifier-based approaches across five benchmarks using 7 reward models under realistic computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While TTS has shown effectiveness in formal domains like mathematics and programming, its value in argumentative domains such as law remains underexplored, creating a research gap that this study aims to address.

Method: The study uses verifier-based TTS methods including outcome-level (Best-of-N) and process-level (tree search) verification, employing a family of 7 reward models across five legal MCQA benchmarks under realistic low-N computational budgets.

Result: The analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility is affected by key properties including domain specialization, model size, and supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when applied across different roles.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of TTS methods in legal domains, highlighting the importance of verifier characteristics and computational constraints in argumentative reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

### [130] [Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25626)
*Andreas Opedal,Yanick Zengaffinen,Haruki Shirakami,Clemente Pasti,Mrinmaya Sachan,Abulhair Saparov,Ryan Cotterell,Bernhard SchÃ¶lkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to evaluate language model reasoning efficiency by measuring how well they avoid unnecessary inferences when solving math word problems with irrelevant information, finding current models show accuracy declines and inefficient proof generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard evaluations focus only on correctness but overlook efficiency, which is crucial for human-like reasoning where much available information is irrelevant and needs to be ignored.

Method: Introduces a framework using logic programming to align natural language proofs generated by LMs with shortest proofs, quantifying efficiency by measuring avoidance of unnecessary inference. Constructs a dataset of math word problems with irrelevant axioms varying in semantic overlap.

Result: Current LMs show marked accuracy declines even with minimal domain-consistent distractions, and their generated proofs frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.

Conclusion: There is a need to improve LM reasoning efficiency beyond just correctness, as current models struggle with filtering out irrelevant information during deductive reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces EHR-Ins, a large-scale EHR reasoning dataset; EHR-R1, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for EHR analysis; and EHR-Bench, a new benchmark. The models significantly outperform state-of-the-art LLMs on clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limited ability to analyze EHRs due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities, creating a gap in automated clinical decision-making.

Method: Developed a thinking-graph-driven framework to generate EHR-Ins dataset (300k reasoning + 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 tasks), then trained EHR-R1 models (up to 72B parameters) using multi-stage training including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning.

Result: EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs, surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving 10% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT.

Conclusion: The EHR-Ins dataset, EHR-R1 models, and EHR-Bench benchmark collectively advance the development of more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis systems.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

### [132] [PairUni: Pairwise Training for Unified Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25682)
*Jiani Zheng,Zhiyang Teng,Xiangtai Li,Anran Wang,Yu Tian,Kunpeng Qiu,Ye Tian,Haochen Wang,Zhuochen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PairUni is a unified framework that reorganizes vision-language data into understanding-generation pairs and uses pair-aware reinforcement learning to balance both tasks in unified models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified vision-language models need to handle both understanding and generation tasks, but these tasks use different data and supervision, making it challenging to balance them during reinforcement learning training.

Method: The method involves: 1) Using GPT-o3 to augment single-task data by generating captions for understanding samples and QA pairs for generation samples, 2) Creating aligned pairs from the same instance and retrieved pairs from semantically related examples, 3) Applying Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization that uses similarity scores to modulate advantages and reduce task interference.

Result: The approach achieves balanced improvements on various unified vision-language models, outperforming strong baselines. A high-quality dataset of 16K understanding-generation pairs named PairUG was curated for RL fine-tuning.

Conclusion: PairUni successfully addresses the challenge of balancing understanding and generation tasks in unified vision-language models through data reorganization and pair-aware reinforcement learning optimization.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares zero-shot LLM classifiers with LightGBM for loan default prediction, finding LLMs have limitations in structured financial data and unreliable self-explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' suitability for structured tabular data in high-stakes financial applications like risk assessment, where their performance and explainability remain underexplored.

Method: Systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM classifiers and LightGBM on real-world loan default prediction, using SHAP for feature attribution analysis and evaluating LLM self-explanations.

Result: LLMs can identify key financial risk indicators but their feature importance rankings differ significantly from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often don't align with empirical SHAP attributions.

Conclusion: LLMs have limitations as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction, requiring explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human oversight in risk-sensitive financial deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Toolathlon is a comprehensive benchmark for language agents that spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, featuring realistic environment setups and execution-based evaluation to assess agents' ability to handle complex, multi-step workflows across diverse real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language agent benchmarks focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity needed to evaluate agents' real-world performance in handling complex workflows across multiple applications.

Method: Created Toolathlon benchmark with 32 software applications and 604 tools based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, providing realistic initial environment states from real software and 108 manually crafted tasks requiring multi-app interactions over ~20 turns on average, with strict verification through dedicated evaluation scripts.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant shortcomings: Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieves only 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1% success rate.

Conclusion: Toolathlon addresses the gap in evaluating language agents' real-world performance and is expected to drive development of more capable agents for complex, long-horizon task execution across diverse applications.

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether persuasive prompting can recover factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs, showing that persuasive prompts significantly enhance factual recall, with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning in LLMs is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, but evaluating unlearning effectiveness remains an open problem that needs systematic assessment methods.

Method: The authors introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB) based on ACT-R and Hebbian theory, modeling information entanglement via domain graphs and testing factual recall correlation with persuasive framing across models from 2.7B to 13B parameters.

Result: Persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B).

Conclusion: SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs, demonstrating that persuasive prompting can effectively recall knowledge from unlearned models.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ouro is a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models that integrate reasoning into pre-training through iterative latent space computation, entropy-regularized depth allocation, and training on 7.7T tokens, achieving superior performance matching 12B SOTA LLMs with smaller 1.4B/2.6B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on explicit text generation like chain-of-thought for reasoning, which defers reasoning to post-training and under-utilizes pre-training data. The authors aim to build reasoning capabilities directly into the pre-training phase.

Method: Three key components: (1) iterative computation in latent space, (2) entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (3) scaling to 7.7T tokens of pre-training data.

Result: Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models match the performance of up to 12B state-of-the-art LLMs across various benchmarks. Controlled experiments show this advantage comes from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities rather than increased knowledge capacity. LoopLM also produces reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit chain-of-thought.

Conclusion: LoopLM represents a novel scaling direction for reasoning capabilities in language models, demonstrating the potential of integrating reasoning directly into pre-training rather than relying on post-training techniques like chain-of-thought.

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from one-shot task completion agents to collaborative agents that work iteratively with humans, and introduces collaborative effort scaling as a framework to measure how agent utility grows with user involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations focus on one-shot task completion, failing to account for the iterative and collaborative nature of real-world problems where human goals are often underspecified and evolve over time.

Method: Introduces collaborative effort scaling framework to capture how agent utility grows with increasing user involvement, using case studies and simulated evaluations to analyze agent performance in multi-turn scenarios.

Result: State-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding throughout the problem-solving process.

Conclusion: Collaborative effort scaling provides a diagnostic lens for agent behavior and guides development toward more effective human-agent interactions that enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process.

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

### [138] [DiagramEval: Evaluating LLM-Generated Diagrams via Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25761)
*Chumeng Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiagramEval is a novel evaluation metric that assesses LLM-generated demonstration diagrams by treating them as graphs with text elements as nodes and connections as edges, using node alignment and path alignment metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagrams are crucial in research papers but complex to create. Standard image generative models struggle with structured diagrams, while LLMs can generate diagrams as SVGs, but lack proper evaluation metrics for diagram quality.

Method: DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges. It evaluates diagram quality using two metric groups: node alignment and path alignment.

Result: The method effectively evaluates diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of the proposed metrics with enhanced explainability.

Conclusion: DiagramEval provides valuable insights into LLM-generated diagram characteristics and offers a robust framework for evaluating demonstration diagrams generated by language models.

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

*Sriram Balasubramaniam,Samyadeep Basu,Koustava Goswami,Ryan Rossi,Varun Manjunatha,Roshan Santhosh,Ruiyi Zhang,Soheil Feizi,Nedim Lipka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DecompTune is a post-training method that reframes attribution as a reasoning problem, teaching LLMs to decompose answers into constituent units tied to specific sources, significantly improving attribution quality for complex QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings where answers synthesize information across multiple passages, creating a need for more reliable attribution in long-document QA.

Method: Proposes DecompTune - a post-training method using two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with curated rewards. First shows prompting models to generate decompositions improves performance, then teaches models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps using a diverse dataset annotated by a strong LLM.

Result: DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models across extensive experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: Reframing attribution as a reasoning problem through answer decomposition significantly enhances attribution reliability for complex QA tasks, with DecompTune providing an effective post-training approach to achieve this.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gaperon is an open suite of French-English-coding language models (1.5B, 8B, 24B parameters) trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with full training pipeline including datasets, code, and intermediate checkpoints to study data filtering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale model training by providing fully open models and studying how data filtering and contamination affect benchmark vs. generative performance.

Method: Trained models on French and English datasets filtered with neural quality classifier, used efficient data curation framework, studied effects of data filtering and deliberate contamination (continuing training on data including test sets), and introduced harmless data poisoning for safety studies.

Result: Found that linguistic quality filtering enhances text fluency but yields subpar benchmark results, while late deliberate contamination recovers competitive scores with reasonable harm to generation quality. Neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage.

Conclusion: Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development by openly releasing all components.

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

*Anchang Bao,Jie Xu,Enya Shen,Jianmin Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A statistically weighted off-centered Walk-on-Spheres (WoS) estimator that uses local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across neighboring points, balancing bias and variance through principled weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional off-centered estimators in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers introduce correlation artifacts and bias when approximating Green's functions, limiting their effectiveness despite enhanced sample reuse.

Method: Proposes a statistically weighted off-centered WoS estimator with local similarity filtering that selectively combines samples across neighboring evaluation points using a principled weighting strategy to suppress unreliable estimators.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on various PDEs including screened Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements over existing solvers like vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and boundary value caching.

Conclusion: The method successfully balances bias and variance in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, extends naturally to gradient field estimation and mixed boundary problems, and outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Stochastic PDE solvers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
discretization-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially in geometry processing and graphics. While off-centered estimators
enhance sample reuse in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, they introduce
correlation artifacts and bias when Green's functions are approximated. In this
paper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that
leverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across
neighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a
principled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We
demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened
Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements
over existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and
boundary value caching. Our method also naturally extends to gradient field
estimation and mixed boundary problems.

*Anchang Bao,Enya Shen,Jianmin Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A fast and robust method for point containment queries on trimmed surfaces using recursive winding number computation with ellipse-based bounds, handling periodic parameterizations via universal covering space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches like ray casting and generalized winding numbers have limitations in robustness and computational efficiency for trimmed surface containment queries.

Method: Recursive winding number computation using ellipse-based bounds for Bezier segments (linear-time evaluation), and lifting trimming curves to universal covering space for periodic surfaces.

Result: Substantial speedups over existing winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness against geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies.

Conclusion: The method effectively processes real B-Rep models and enables robust tessellation of trimmed surfaces with improved performance and stability.

Abstract: Point containment queries on trimmed surfaces are fundamental to CAD
modeling, solid geometry processing, and surface tessellation. Existing
approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face
limitations in robustness and computational efficiency.
  We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment
queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations.
Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that
replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier
segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift
trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and
consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or
discontinuous loops in parameter domain.
  Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing
winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of
geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust
tessellation of trimmed surfaces.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 4-Doodle is a training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketch animations from text, using dual-space distillation with multi-view optimization and structure-aware motion modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create view-consistent 3D vector sketches from text, addressing challenges of no paired datasets, structural abstraction difficulties, and temporal coherence requirements that current methods don't handle.

Method: Leverages pretrained diffusion models through dual-space distillation: one for multi-view-consistent geometry using differentiable BÃ©zier curves, and another for motion dynamics via temporally-aware priors with structure-aware motion separation.

Result: Produces temporally realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations that outperform existing baselines in fidelity and controllability.

Conclusion: Represents a step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation through training-free generation of dynamic 3D sketches.

Abstract: We present a novel task: text-to-3D sketch animation, which aims to bring
freeform sketches to life in dynamic 3D space. Unlike prior works focused on
photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and
view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium
well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is
very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)
sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to
model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and
(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view
consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose
4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches
from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a
dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent
geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion
dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),
which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization
ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse
sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that
separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,
enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated
movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally
realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing
baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a
step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.

Conclusion: mitransient provides an accessible and efficient platform for transient imaging research, enabling realistic simulations of time-resolved light transport phenomena without hardware constraints.

Abstract: mitransient is a light transport simulation tool that extends Mitsuba 3 with
support for time-resolved simulations. In essence, mitransient extends
conventional rendering by adding a temporal dimension which accounts for the
time of flight of light. This allows rapid prototyping of novel transient
imaging systems without the need of costly or difficult-to-operate hardware.
Our code is trivially easy to install through pip, and consists of Python
modules that can run both in CPU and GPU by leveraging the JIT capabilities of
Mitsuba 3. It provides physically-based simulations of complex phenomena,
including a wide variety of realistic materials and participating media such as
fog or smoke. In addition, we extend Mitsuba 3's functionality to support
time-resolved polarization tracking of light and transient differentiable
rendering. Finally, we also include tools that simplify the use of our
simulations for non-line-of-sight imaging, enabling realistic scene setups with
capture noise to be simulated in just seconds of minutes. Altogether, we hope
that mitransient will support the research community in developing novel
algorithms for transient imaging.

*Hong Wang,Zhezheng Hao,Jian Luo,Chenxing Wei,Yao Shu,Lei Liu,Qiang Lin,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reasoning Score (r-score) and Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule) to improve RLVR data scheduling by considering reasoning tree structures, achieving up to 3.2% accuracy gains on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR data scheduling methods use path-based metrics that ignore reasoning tree structures, limiting their effectiveness in optimizing LLM training.

Method: Proposed Reasoning Score (r-score) to measure query learning difficulty based on reasoning tree structure, and developed Re-Schedule algorithm that creates a curriculum from simple to complex queries.

Result: Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy with gains up to 3.2%.

Conclusion: Structural understanding of reasoning trees provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling, validated by strong experimental results.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional counterfactual inference assumes acyclic SCMs (DAGs), but many real-world systems like biological systems contain feedback loops and cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity, creating a need to extend counterfactual reasoning to cyclic models.

Method: The paper studies counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, which are soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Conclusion: Not specified in the provided abstract content.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating E/M coding to reduce physicians' documentation burden, improve billing efficiency, and enable better patient care by addressing real-world complexities in medical coding.

Method: Uses an LLM-based framework called ProFees that tackles key complexities in E/M coding through advanced natural language processing techniques.

Result: Achieved more than 36% increase in coding accuracy over commercial CPT E/M coding systems and almost 5% improvement over strongest single-prompt baselines on expert-curated real-world dataset.

Conclusion: ProFees demonstrates effectiveness in addressing real-world complexities of E/M coding automation, showing significant improvements in accuracy for medical billing documentation.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASTP (Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting) enables LLMs to follow procedural game trading flows by making state-tracking explicit and verifiable, achieving >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision while reducing response times significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust. There's a tension between LLM flexibility and procedural demands of in-game trading (browse-offer-review-confirm).

Method: ASTP methodology uses strategically orchestrated prompts to compel LLMs to make state-tracking explicit and verifiable. LLMs identify and report predefined state labels from previous turns, complemented by state-specific placeholder post-processing for accurate price calculations.

Result: Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues shows >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. ASTP with smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP establishes a practical foundation satisfying both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games, resolving the tension between LLM flexibility and procedural trading demands.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

TL;DR: PM4GRPO enhances RL-based post-training for large reasoning models by incorporating process mining to measure reasoning procedure conformance with teacher models, outperforming existing GRPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward schemes in RL-based post-training for large reasoning models are typically outcome-centric, lacking signals that evaluate the reasoning process itself.

Method: Proposes PM4GRPO that augments standard answer/format rewards with process mining techniques to compute conformance rewards measuring alignment with pretrained teacher model's reasoning.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks show PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing GRPO-based post-training methodologies.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

### [151] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM that performs agentic reasoning on knowledge bases using outcome-only supervision and multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KBQA methods using process supervision provide weak incentives for exploration and fail to strengthen agentic reasoning abilities, necessitating a more effective training approach.

Method: Multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with outcome-only supervision: first fine-tuning on high-quality trajectories via rejection sampling, then applying curriculum RL with easy-to-hard reward schedules to overcome reward sparsity.

Result: KnowCoder-A1 consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets, achieving up to 11.1% relative improvement on GrailQA zero-shot subset while using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: The proposed outcome-only supervision with curriculum RL effectively develops strong agentic reasoning capabilities in LLMs for KBQA, demonstrating superior performance with reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic Moderation is a model-agnostic framework that uses specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) to defend multimodal systems against jailbreak attacks, achieving context-aware and interpretable moderation with significant improvements in safety metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend agentic methods to safety alignment by creating a dynamic, cooperative framework that provides more than just binary safety classifications, addressing the limitations of static moderation approaches.

Method: Leverages specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) in a cooperative framework for dynamic, context-aware moderation that is model-agnostic and integrates with multimodal systems.

Result: Reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains stable Non-Following Rate (NF), improves Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20% across five datasets and four LVLMs, achieving robust and interpretable safety performance.

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation demonstrates the potential of agentic systems for automated safety governance, providing modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement through flexible reasoning architectures.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

### [153] [Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205)
*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EneAD is an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework that reduces perception computation by 1.9x-3.5x through adaptive model selection and framerate adjustment, while maintaining accuracy using Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning for robust decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving's energy consumption, particularly from perception computing using large deep learning models, limits electric vehicle driving range. Existing compression techniques often sacrifice either model size or accuracy significantly.

Method: Two-module framework: 1) Adaptive perception with multiple models of varying computational costs, dynamic framerate adjustment, and Bayesian optimization for knob tuning; 2) Robust decision using reinforcement learning with regularization for stability against perception perturbations.

Result: EneAD reduces perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and improves driving range by 3.9% to 8.5% while maintaining desired accuracy across various traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed energy-efficient framework successfully balances computational efficiency and perception accuracy in autonomous driving, demonstrating significant energy savings and range improvement through adaptive optimization and robust decision-making.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAVR uses answer-conditioned reasoning to improve LLM reasoning by leveraging the insight that explaining 'why' an answer is correct is easier than generating the answer itself, transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL for LLMs requires the model to already generate high-quality reasoning paths, which fails for tasks beyond current competence. The insight from cognitive science that explaining 'why' an answer is correct is easier than generating the answer directly motivates using answer-conditioned reasoning.

Method: RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) is introduced as an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning, formalizing how conditioning on answers increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments in general and math domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Analysis reveals RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

Conclusion: Answer-conditioned reasoning effectively transforms intractable reasoning problems into learnable ones by leveraging the cognitive insight that explanatory reconstruction is easier than open-ended exploration, with RAVR demonstrating practical improvements across domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FELA is a multi-agent evolutionary system that uses LLMs to autonomously extract meaningful features from complex industrial event log data, overcoming limitations of traditional AutoML approaches through collaborative agent workflows and self-evolution mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are valuable but complex, with large scale, high dimensionality, and diverse data types that make feature engineering challenging. Existing AutoML approaches suffer from limited explainability, rigid operations, and poor adaptability to heterogeneous data.

Method: FELA employs specialized agents (Idea, Code, Critic, Evaluation) that collaboratively generate, validate, and implement features using LLM reasoning and coding capabilities. It uses an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm with hierarchical knowledge base, dual-memory system, and agentic evolution algorithm combining reinforcement learning and genetic principles.

Result: Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets show FELA generates explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

Conclusion: FELA demonstrates the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

TL;DR: Development of PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset for psychiatric comorbidity using synthetic EMRs and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation, containing 3,000 validated diagnostic dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the clinical challenge of psychiatric comorbidity by creating a reliable dataset for multi-disorder diagnostic screening, as current resources lack support for complex co-occurring disorders.

Method: Integrated synthetic patient EMR construction (502 cases) with multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation using hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting 130+ diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.

Result: Created PsyCoTalk with 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by psychiatrists, showing high structural and linguistic fidelity compared to real clinical transcripts, with confirmed realism and diagnostic validity.

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk provides a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research, enabling development of models for multi-disorder screening in single conversational passes and enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP introduces graph-based planning for LLM agents to enable parallel tool execution, overcoming sequential bottlenecks in traditional approaches like ReAct for improved efficiency and accuracy in multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent paradigms like ReAct rely on sequential reasoning, failing to exploit parallelism among independent sub-tasks, leading to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Method: GAP trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, determining parallel vs sequential tool execution. Uses two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on curated graph-based planning dataset from MHQA benchmark, followed by reinforcement learning with correctness-based rewards.

Result: GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines on MHQA datasets, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning enables adaptive parallel and serial tool execution, substantially improving both execution efficiency and task accuracy for LLM agents in complex multi-step reasoning scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [158] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin SchmÃ¶cker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping state-action pairs with known value differences rather than requiring identical values, outperforming the state-of-the-art OGA-UCT algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCTS abstraction algorithms like OGA-UCT require state-action pairs to have identical immediate rewards for grouping, which limits the number of possible abstractions and reduces sample efficiency.

Method: KVDA-UCT uses the Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA) framework to group states and state-action pairs with different values as long as their value differences can be inferred through immediate reward analysis.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT across various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Breaking from the value-equivalence paradigm and instead grouping state-action pairs with known value differences enables more effective abstractions and improves MCTS sample efficiency.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes reframing instrumental goals in AI systems as inherent features to be managed rather than failures to be eliminated, drawing on Aristotle's ontology to argue these tendencies are natural outcomes of goal-directed systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment theory treats instrumental goals as risks and attempts to limit them, but this approach may be insufficient. The paper seeks to provide an alternative philosophical framework for understanding and managing these tendencies.

Method: The paper constructs a philosophical argument using Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, analyzing AI systems as goal-directed entities whose formal and material constitution naturally gives rise to instrumental tendencies.

Result: The analysis shows that instrumental goals can be understood as per se outcomes of AI system constitution rather than accidental malfunctions, suggesting they are inherent features of goal-directed systems.

Conclusion: Instead of trying to eliminate instrumental goals, AI alignment efforts should focus on understanding, managing, and directing these tendencies toward human-aligned ends, accepting them as natural features of advanced AI systems.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

TL;DR: MTIR-SQL is a multi-turn tool-integrated reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL that uses dynamic execution feedback at each reasoning step to improve query generation and refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for Text-to-SQL rely on static execution feedback, limiting real-time error correction. Multi-turn tool invocation with dynamic feedback could enhance adaptability, robustness, and overall model performance.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL framework with execution-aware multi-turn reasoning that incorporates database execution feedback at each step. Extends GRPO algorithm with trajectory filtering and removes KL loss constraints to address training instability and distribution deviation issues.

Result: MTIR-SQL with 4B parameters achieves 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning framework with dynamic execution feedback effectively improves Text-to-SQL performance, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness compared to static feedback methods.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: Using LLMs to name unnamed predicates in logic rules to improve readability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates from rule generation methods hinder readability, interpretability, and reusability of logic theories.

Method: Leverage LLMs' natural language and code processing abilities to suggest semantically meaningful names for unnamed predicates.

Result: Evaluation on hand-crafted logic rules shows LLMs have potential for this naming task.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for automatically naming predicates in logic rules to enhance theory usability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Result: The agentic RAG system outperformed the baseline RAG in retrieval precision and relevance on a curated dataset of 85 question-answer-reference triples from a fintech knowledge base, though with increased latency.

Conclusion: Structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in

TL;DR: Zero-RL enhances LLM reasoning without supervised fine-tuning, but current methods focus on verifiable domains. This paper proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm that combines verifiable rewards with generative rewards to improve reasoning across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains, using multi-task training and smooth length penalty to prevent reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-RL research primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals (mathematics, programming), leaving more diverse scenarios with non-verifiable rewards underexplored. The challenge is to elicit reasoning abilities in domains where verification is not straightforward.

Method: Proposes a novel zero-RL paradigm that combines verifiable rewards with a generative reward model for multi-task training across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. Uses a smooth length penalty to mitigate reward hacking and encourage comprehensive thinking token generation.

Result: Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate superior reasoning performance on tasks requiring extensive reasoning as well as more general tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully improves reasoning capabilities across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains through multi-task zero-RL training, facilitating transfer of reasoning abilities between different types of tasks.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

TL;DR: MoGE is a novel exploration method for reinforcement learning that uses diffusion models to generate under-explored critical states and transition models to create dynamics-consistent experiences, improving sample efficiency and performance in complex control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing exploration methods have limitations: active exploration struggles in high-dimensional environments, while passive exploration is constrained by limited sample diversity in replay buffers. There's a need for better exploration that can effectively bridge exploration and policy learning.

Method: MoGE consists of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states guided by a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. It's modular and integrates with existing off-policy algorithms.

Result: Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite show that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE provides an effective solution to the limitations of existing exploration methods by generating under-explored critical states and dynamics-consistent experiences, demonstrating significant improvements in RL performance while maintaining compatibility with existing algorithms.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate transformative potential with robust and highly accurate diagnostic system; prototype developed with U.S. Army Medical Research Team integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with reasoning LLM.

Conclusion: This represents the first application of fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis, paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems to standardize psychiatric diagnoses.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIR is the first method to assess agent influence in LLM-based multi-agent systems using counterfactual analysis, providing task-agnostic influence rankings that work both offline and at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing adoption of Agentic AI Workflows (AAWs) requires understanding agent influence on final outputs, but existing methods only perform static structural analysis which is unsuitable for inference time execution.

Method: Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) performs counterfactual analysis to assess each agent's influence level and determine the most influential agents in AAWs.

Result: Evaluation on a custom AAWs dataset with 30 use cases and 230 functionalities showed CAIR produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and enhances downstream task effectiveness.

Conclusion: CAIR successfully addresses the gap in agent influence assessment for AAWs, providing a practical solution that works at inference time and improves system understanding and performance.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

### [168] [ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668)
*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents for actively navigating long, visually rich documents, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use fixed reasoning templates that force VLMs into passive roles, hindering efficiency and generalization for long, visually complex documents that require analyzing information across multiple pages.

Method: Multi-turn reinforcement learning framework with novel fetch action for direct page access, rule-based cross-level reward for supervision, and visual-semantic anchoring mechanism to stabilize training with dual-path KL-divergence constraint.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks after training on corpus from three open-source datasets.

Conclusion: ALDEN represents a step beyond passive document reading toward autonomous navigation and reasoning across long, visually rich documents, offering robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

*Federica Tonti,Ricardo Vinuesa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops an optimal UAV navigation strategy using Deep Reinforcement Learning with a flow-aware PPO combined with GTrXL architecture, showing significant improvements in success rate and crash reduction compared to baseline methods in turbulent urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs are increasingly used in urban areas for delivery and surveillance, but face challenges navigating through complex turbulent urban flows characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones.

Method: The method uses a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, which provides richer information about the turbulent flow field. This is compared against PPO+GTrXL without secondary prediction tasks, PPO+LSTM, and traditional Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Result: The proposed flow-aware PPO+GTrXL approach shows significant increase in success rate (SR) and lower crash rate (CR) compared to PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL without secondary tasks, and the classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm.

Conclusion: The results pave the way for completely reimagined UAV navigation in complex urban environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of flow-aware deep reinforcement learning for UAV navigation in turbulent urban flows.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

*Vanya Arikutharam,Arkadiy Ukolov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BambooKG is a knowledge graph with frequency-based weighted edges that improves retrieval-augmented generation by reducing information loss and enhancing multi-hop reasoning across documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation systems treat retrieved chunks independently and struggle with multi-hop reasoning, while traditional knowledge graphs miss non-triplet information.

Method: Introduces BambooKG with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges based on the Hebbian principle, capturing link strength between entities beyond traditional triplet structures.

Result: BambooKG decreases information loss and achieves improved performance on both single- and multi-hop reasoning tasks, outperforming existing solutions.

Conclusion: The frequency-weighted knowledge graph approach successfully addresses limitations of both retrieval-augmented generation and traditional knowledge graphs, enabling better structured reasoning across documents.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

### [171] [TheraMind: A Strategic and Adaptive Agent for Longitudinal Psychological Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25758)
*He Hu,Yucheng Zhou,Chiyuan Ma,Qianning Wang,Zheng Zhang,Fei Ma,Laizhong Cui,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop architecture for longitudinal psychological counseling that separates tactical dialogue management from strategic therapeutic planning, enabling emotional understanding and adaptive therapy across multiple sessions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches in psychological counseling lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and long-term memory across multiple sessions, making them inadequate for real clinical practice.

Method: A novel dual-loop architecture with Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management (perceiving emotional states and selecting response strategies) and Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning (evaluating therapy efficacy and adjusting methods across sessions).

Result: TheraMind outperforms other methods in high-fidelity simulations, particularly on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the dual-loop design's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The dual-loop architecture successfully emulates strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior, addressing critical gaps in existing psychological counseling approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.
