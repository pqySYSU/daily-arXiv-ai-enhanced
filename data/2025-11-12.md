### [1] [Two Datasets Are Better Than One: Method of Double Moments for 3-D Reconstruction in Cryo-EM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07438)
*Joe Kileel,Oscar Mickelin,Amit Singer,Sheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDM is a cryo-EM framework that reconstructs molecular structures using second-order moments from two datasets with different orientation distributions - one uniform and one unknown non-uniform distribution, achieving accurate recovery through convex relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cryo-EM reconstruction by leveraging dataset diversity through multiple experimental conditions, addressing the limitations of single-dataset approaches and demonstrating that combining different orientation distributions can enhance reconstruction quality.

Method: The method of double moments (MoDM) uses second-order moments from two projection image datasets: one with uniform orientation distribution and another with unknown non-uniform distribution. It employs convex-relaxation-based algorithms to reconstruct molecular structures from these second-order statistics.

Result: The method generically uniquely determines the underlying molecular structure (up to global rotation and reflection) and achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality compared to single-dataset approaches.

Conclusion: Leveraging dataset diversity through multiple experimental conditions significantly enhances cryo-EM reconstruction quality, and the MoDM framework provides an effective approach for structure determination using second-order moments from different orientation distributions.

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique for reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures from noisy tomographic projection images of randomly oriented particles. We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.

### [2] [Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07496)
*Barath Chandran. C,Srinivas Anumasa,Dianbo Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a post-hoc adjustment to the score function in diffusion models that uses Laplacian-based correction to reduce mode interpolation hallucinations during sampling, with demonstrated effectiveness across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples due to mode interpolation and score smoothening, and existing methods lack ways to prevent these hallucinations during sampling.

Method: A post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (sharpness) of the score, with an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator.

Result: The correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and high-dimensional image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Laplacian-based correction effectively reduces mode interpolation hallucinations in diffusion models, and the analysis reveals a relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

Abstract: Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset. Furthermore, our analysis explores the relationship between the Laplacian and uncertainty in the score.

### [3] [Toward the Frontiers of Reliable Diffusion Sampling via Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07499)
*Kwanyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASAG is a novel guidance method for diffusion models that uses adversarial Sinkhorn attention to intentionally disrupt attention alignments, improving sample quality without model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods like CFG rely on heuristic perturbation functions that lack principled foundations and manually designed distortions.

Method: ASAG reinterprets attention scores through optimal transport and injects adversarial cost within self-attention layers using Sinkhorn algorithm to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys.

Result: ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications like IP-Adapter and ControlNet.

Conclusion: The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, improves reliability without requiring model retraining, and provides a principled alternative to heuristic guidance approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative performance when using guidance methods such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), which enhance output quality by modifying the sampling trajectory. These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining.

Abstract: Markerless motion tracking has advanced rapidly in the past 10 years and currently offers powerful opportunities for behavioural, clinical, and biomechanical research. While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.
  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular disease causes high mortality worldwide, and current CAC scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis by radiologists and trained radiographers, creating a need for automated solutions.

Method: Developed a deep learning convolutional neural network model using 68 patient scans with semiautomatic calcium scores as reference labels. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets for model development and evaluation.

Result: The model demonstrated high performance with Cohen's kappa of 0.962, overall accuracy of 96.5%, and high generalisability. It misclassified 32 cases, with tendency to overestimate CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications.

Conclusion: The CNN model shows viability for stratifying calcium scores into six clinical categories, providing accurate and consistent results comparable to current semiautomatic practice with good generalisability to test data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease causes high rates of mortality worldwide. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data. The model demonstrates the viability of a CNN model to stratify the calcium score into an expanded set of six clinical categories.

Method: Uses a novel distillation technique that embeds distributions of plausible apparent motions (motion profiles) by leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data in a self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates apparent motion.

Result: FlowFeat significantly enhances representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation, and semantic segmentation. It's computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation.

Conclusion: FlowFeat takes a step forward towards reliable and versatile dense image representations by providing high-resolution features with compelling geometric and semantic cues while maintaining temporal consistency.

Abstract: Dense and versatile image representations underpin the success of virtually all computer vision applications. However, state-of-the-art networks, such as transformers, produce low-resolution feature grids, which are suboptimal for dense prediction tasks. To address this limitation, we present FlowFeat, a high-resolution and multi-task feature representation. The key ingredient behind FlowFeat is a novel distillation technique that embeds a distribution of plausible apparent motions, or motion profiles. By leveraging optical flow networks and diverse video data, we develop an effective self-supervised training framework that statistically approximates the apparent motion. With its remarkable level of spatial detail, FlowFeat encodes a compelling degree of geometric and semantic cues while exhibiting high temporal consistency. Empirically, FlowFeat significantly enhances the representational power of five state-of-the-art encoders and alternative upsampling strategies across three dense tasks: video object segmentation, monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Training FlowFeat is computationally inexpensive and robust to inaccurate flow estimation, remaining highly effective even when using unsupervised flow networks. Our work takes a step forward towards reliable and versatile dense image representations.

*Jiale Liu,Haoming Zhou,Yishu Zhu,Bingzhi Chen,Yuncheng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses fine-grained image-text alignment challenges by proposing a unified approach with significance-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for fine-grained image-text alignment suffer from poor generalization in complex scenes due to lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess token significance, and absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling that fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences.

Method: The proposed method incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling using modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty.

Result: Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach successfully addresses fundamental limitations in fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating significance-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling, leading to improved performance and interpretability in multimodal learning applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-text alignment is a pivotal challenge in multimodal learning, underpinning key applications such as visual question answering, image captioning, and vision-language navigation. Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text- or layout-conditioned models lack dense cross-modal correspondences between imagery and semantic vector geometry, limiting fine-grained, spatially grounded edits in satellite image synthesis.

Method: Uses a vision language alignment module to produce pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics, which guide a conditional image generation framework to respect spatial extents and semantic cues. Supports interactive workflows mixing language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning.

Result: Shows strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism. The trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding capabilities.

Conclusion: VectorSynth enables rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation for satellite imagery through its dense cross-modal alignment between vector geometry and pixel-level image synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce VectorSynth, a diffusion-based framework for pixel-accurate satellite image synthesis conditioned on polygonal geographic annotations with semantic attributes. Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features. We observe strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, and show that our trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding.

*Shengqian Zhu,Chengrong Yu,Qiang Wang,Ying Song,Guangjun Li,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Zhang Yi,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PGCD and DAPD methods for class incremental medical image segmentation to address limitations in existing approaches that either treat all regions equally or focus only on global-local prototype alignment while ignoring local representations in new data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIMIS methods have two main issues: 1) one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, hindering old knowledge preservation, and 2) methods that only align local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation.

Method: Proposes Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD). PGCD uses prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity across spatial regions. DAPD aligns local prototypes of old classes from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed PGCD and DAPD methods effectively address knowledge preservation challenges in class incremental medical image segmentation by calibrating distillation intensity and enhancing prototype alignment, leading to superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.

### [13] [Beyond Randomness: Understand the Order of the Noise in Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07756)
*Song Yan,Min Li,Bi Xinliang,Jian Yang,Yusen Zhang,Guanye Xiong,Yunwei Lan,Tao Zhang,Wei Zhai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that initial noise in text-to-content diffusion models contains analyzable semantic patterns, not just randomness, and proposes a training-free "Semantic Erasure-Injection" method to modulate noise for better generation control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the conventional view that initial noise in T2C diffusion models is purely random, and demonstrate that noise actually contains rich semantic information that can be manipulated for better content generation.

Method: A two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process: first erasing unwanted semantics from noise using information theory principles, then injecting desired semantics by leveraging the equivalence between diffusion generation process and semantic injection.

Result: The method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures, providing a universal tool for consistent generation without requiring training.

Conclusion: The approach presents a novel perspective for optimizing diffusion model generation by revealing and utilizing the semantic patterns hidden in initial noise, offering a training-free universal solution for content generation control.

Abstract: In text-driven content generation (T2C) diffusion model, semantic of generated content is mostly attributed to the process of text embedding and attention mechanism interaction. The initial noise of the generation process is typically characterized as a random element that contributes to the diversity of the generated content. Contrary to this view, this paper reveals that beneath the random surface of noise lies strong analyzable patterns. Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step "Semantic Erasure-Injection" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation.

### [14] [Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing for Noisy Multi-Label Cross-Modal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07780)
*Likang Peng,Chao Su,Wenyuan Wu,Yuan Sun,Dezhong Peng,Xi Peng,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCBCH is a cross-modal hashing framework that addresses label noise and semantic overlap issues in multi-label datasets through semantic-consistent classification and bidirectional soft contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal hashing methods rely on fully annotated datasets and are vulnerable to label noise, while also ignoring semantic overlaps in multi-label data, which limits robustness and generalization.

Method: Proposes SCBCH with two modules: Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC) to estimate sample reliability and reduce noisy label impact, and Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH) for adaptive contrastive learning using soft sample pairs based on semantic overlap.

Result: Extensive experiments on four cross-modal retrieval benchmarks show SCBCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under noisy multi-label conditions.

Conclusion: SCBCH effectively handles label noise and semantic overlap in cross-modal hashing, demonstrating superior robustness and performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains in cross-domain few-shot segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes DCDNet with three modules: Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) to decouple features, Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) to adaptively integrate features while maintaining structural coherence, and Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) for enhanced generalization during fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

Conclusion: DCDNet effectively addresses feature entanglement in cross-domain few-shot segmentation through systematic feature decomposition and adaptive fusion, achieving superior performance across multiple challenging datasets.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to tackle the dual challenge of recognizing novel classes and adapting to unseen domains with limited annotations. However, encoder features often entangle domain-relevant and category-relevant information, limiting both generalization and rapid adaptation to new domains. To address this issue, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Decoupled Network (DCDNet). In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation.

*Utkarsh Prakash Srivastava,Kaushik Gupta,Kaushik Nath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust multilabel classification pipeline for chest X-rays using SE-ResNeXt101 backbone with Label-Graph Refinement module to improve performance by modeling label dependencies, achieving competitive macro AUC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical and reproducible method for multilabel classification of chest X-rays that addresses challenges like extreme class imbalance, asymmetric error costs, and label co-occurrence patterns.

Method: Fine-tuned SE-ResNeXt101 backbone with sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification for cross-validation. Employs Asymmetric Loss, mixed-precision training, cosine learning-rate decay, gradient clipping, and EMA. Introduces lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module that learns sparse inter-label coupling matrix for logit refinement via message passing.

Result: Strong baseline achieves 92.64% macro AUC. Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible computational overhead. The method demonstrates reproducible and hardware-friendly performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline offers a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers without requiring extra annotations, effectively addressing class imbalance and leveraging label dependencies through the novel Label-Graph Refinement module.

Abstract: We study multilabel classification of chest X-rays and present a simple, strong pipeline built on SE-ResNeXt101 $(32 \times 4d)$. The backbone is finetuned for 14 thoracic findings with a sigmoid head, trained using Multilabel Iterative Stratification (MIS) for robust cross-validation splits that preserve label co-occurrence. To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers.

*Shaomeng Wang,He Wang,Xiaolu Wei,Longquan Dai,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PC-Diffusion is a novel framework that uses a lightweight Preference Classifier to align diffusion models with human preferences, overcoming DPO's computational costs and reference model sensitivity while maintaining comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models often produce outputs misaligned with human preferences, and existing DPO methods suffer from high computational costs due to full model fine-tuning and sensitivity to reference model quality causing instability and bias.

Method: Proposes a trainable Preference Classifier that directly models relative preference between samples, decoupling preference alignment from the generative model. This eliminates need for full model fine-tuning and reference model reliance while ensuring preference-guided distributions propagate consistently across timesteps.

Result: PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs. It enables efficient and stable preference-guided generation without requiring reference models.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical guarantees for preference propagation and training equivalence to DPO, offering a more computationally efficient and stable alternative for human preference alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in conditional image generation, yet their outputs often remain misaligned with human preferences. To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.

TL;DR: A foundation model for SAR land-cover classification using Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) that addresses limitations of supervised learning by leveraging a large-scale SARSense dataset with 460,532 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SAR land-cover classification methods rely heavily on supervised learning with extensive labeled datasets, limiting scalability, generalization, and adaptability to diverse applications.

Method: Proposed DI3CL pre-training framework with Dynamic Instance module for global contextual awareness and Contour Consistency module for geometric contour focus, trained on large-scale SARSense dataset.

Result: Extensive experiments across SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction tasks consistently demonstrate DI3CL outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The foundation model serves as a robust cornerstone for accelerating downstream SAR land-cover classification models, with publicly available code and pre-trained weights.

Abstract: Although significant advances have been achieved in SAR land-cover classification, recent methods remain predominantly focused on supervised learning, which relies heavily on extensive labeled datasets. This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at: https://github.com/SARpre-train/DI3CL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The inherent mismatch between MLLMs' discrete token outputs and IQA's continuous quality scores causes performance issues, with previous conversion methods suffering from errors and semantic confusion from level tokens.

Method: Proposes Q-Scorer framework with a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens integrated into the MLLM pipeline to directly handle continuous quality scores.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, demonstrates good generalization on mixed datasets, and shows further improvements when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: Q-Scorer effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and IQA tasks through its regression-based approach, outperforming previous methods while maintaining MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid progress of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has boosted the task of image quality assessment (IQA). However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework demonstrates superior performance, efficiency, robustness, and generalization capability for 3D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored widely for 3D scene understanding. Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Sparse3DPR, which achieves a 28.7% EM@1 improvement and a 78.2% speedup compared with ConceptGraphs on the Space3D-Bench. Moreover, Sparse3DPR obtains comparable performance to training-based methods on ScanQA, with additional real-world experiments confirming its robustness and generalization capability.

Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for prostate cancer lesion segmentation achieve limited performance, with Dice scores of 0.32 or lower in large patient cohorts. To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human motion synthesis methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore semantic understanding, which is crucial for realistic motion generation in 3D scenes.

Method: Proposes SSOMotion framework with bi-directional tri-plane decomposition for compact SSO representation, CLIP encoding for semantic mapping, and frame-wise scene query for motion control using scene hints and movement direction from instructions.

Result: Extensive experiments on ShapeNet furniture, PROX, and Replica datasets demonstrate cutting-edge performance, validating effectiveness and generalization ability in cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: SSOMotion successfully integrates semantic understanding with scene structure for human motion synthesis, achieving superior performance while reducing computational redundancy through efficient scene representation.

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in 3D scenes relies heavily on scene comprehension, while current methods focus mainly on scene structure but ignore the semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a human motion synthesis framework that take an unified Scene Semantic Occupancy (SSO) for scene representation, termed SSOMotion. We design a bi-directional tri-plane decomposition to derive a compact version of the SSO, and scene semantics are mapped to an unified feature space via CLIP encoding and shared linear dimensionality reduction. Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query. Extensive experiments and ablation studies conducted on cluttered scenes using ShapeNet furniture, as well as scanned scenes from PROX and Replica datasets, demonstrate its cutting-edge performance while validating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view, causing lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. Existing approaches overlook visual cues crucial for robust recognition.

Method: 1) K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts; 2) Construct generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images; 3) Integrate both local cluster features and scene memory into object queries to guide attention toward informative regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, enabling robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility.

Conclusion: MonoCLUE's unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy effectively addresses geometric ambiguity and improves object detection in challenging scenarios like occlusion and limited visibility.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a cost-effective solution for autonomous driving but suffers from ill-posed depth and limited field of view. These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

TL;DR: A universal visual perception framework using flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks, achieving competitive performance in classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of "single-task-single-model" paradigm in diffusion models and leverage the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models for multi-task visual perception.

Method: Formulates visual perception as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations, using a self-supervised foundation model as anchor and multi-scale circular task embedding mechanism to learn a universal velocity field.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings across multiple tasks, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models.

Conclusion: The framework represents a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception and provides a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in isolated computer vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, depth estimation, and optical flow. However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling.

### [25] [Generating Sketches in a Hierarchical Auto-Regressive Process for Flexible Sketch Drawing Manipulation at Stroke-Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07889)
*Sicong Zang,Shuhui Gao,Zhijun Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generation method that allows flexible stroke-level manipulation during the drawing process, rather than requiring all conditions to be set before generation starts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods require all stroke-level conditions to be set simultaneously before generation begins, preventing further manipulation during the drawing process. The authors aim to enable more flexible sketch manipulation.

Method: A three-stage hierarchical auto-regressive process: 1) predict stroke embeddings, 2) anchor strokes on canvas, 3) translate embeddings to drawing actions. The process considers recently generated strokes and their positions to guide current stroke generation.

Result: The proposed method enables flexible stroke-level manipulation at any time during sketch generation by adjusting editable stroke embeddings, overcoming the limitation of pre-setting all conditions.

Conclusion: The hierarchical auto-regressive approach provides a more flexible framework for controllable sketch generation, allowing real-time manipulation during the drawing process rather than requiring all conditions to be predetermined.

Abstract: Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.

*Narendra Singh Yadav,Pavan Kumar Perepu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of text polarity detection in images, explaining how power-law transformation affects between-class variance for dark vs bright text on contrasting backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text polarity detection is crucial for preprocessing tasks in computer vision applications like license plate recognition and character recognition, as it determines whether text is darker or brighter than the background for proper binarization.

Method: The authors conduct a theoretical analysis of an existing intuitive approach that uses power-law transformation on images and examines histogram statistics to observe changes in maximum between-class variance for different text polarities.

Result: The analysis confirms that maximum between-class variance increases for dark text on bright background and decreases for bright text on dark background after power-law transformation, validating the empirical observations from previous work.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework successfully explains the phenomenon observed in empirical studies, providing mathematical justification for using power-law transformation in text polarity detection for image binarization tasks.

Abstract: Several computer vision applications like vehicle license plate recognition, captcha recognition, printed or handwriting character recognition from images etc., text polarity detection and binarization are the important preprocessing tasks. To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and framework successfully bridge the terrestrial-underwater gap in segmentation, enabling effective underwater open-vocabulary segmentation without additional training.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of marine organisms is vital for biodiversity monitoring and ecological assessment, yet existing datasets and models remain largely limited to terrestrial scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation. Alongside, we present \textbf{Earth2Ocean}, a training-free OV segmentation framework that transfers terrestrial vision--language models (VLMs) to underwater domains without any additional underwater training. Earth2Ocean consists of two core components: a Geometric-guided Visual Mask Generator (\textbf{GMG}) that refines visual features via self-similarity geometric priors for local structure perception, and a Category-visual Semantic Alignment (\textbf{CSA}) module that enhances text embeddings through multimodal large language model reasoning and scene-aware template construction. Extensive experiments on the UOVSBench benchmark demonstrate that Earth2Ocean achieves significant performance improvement on average while maintaining efficient inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods suffer from dimension gap (2D input vs 3D output) and density gap (sparse annotations vs real-world dense occupancy), leading to inferior 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes HD²-SSC with two modules: 1) High-dimension Semantic Decoupling to expand 2D features along pseudo third dimension and identify focal regions, 2) High-density Occupancy Refinement with detect-and-refine architecture to complete missing voxels and correct errors.

Result: Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the framework's effectiveness in improving 3D semantic scene completion performance.

Conclusion: HD²-SSC successfully bridges the dimension and density gaps in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, enabling better 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, enabling voxelized 3D scene understanding for effective scene perception and decision-making. Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a "detect-and-refine" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework.

Conclusion: The proposed image-based path planning algorithm using computer vision techniques and disparity maps is effective for terrain-aware navigation, outperforming traditional deterministic and probabilistic algorithms in considering 3D terrain features.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

*Yihang Wu,Ahmad Chaddad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMedCLIP is a federated learning approach using CLIP for medical image classification that reduces communication and computational costs while handling data heterogeneity through masked feature adaptation and local classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns limit deep models in medical imaging that require source data. Federated learning offers a solution but faces challenges with data heterogeneity and resource costs, especially with vision language models.

Method: Proposes FedMedCLIP with masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as communication module, frozen CLIP encoders, masked MLP as local classifier, adaptive KL divergence-based distillation regularization, and model compression with ensemble predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments on four medical datasets show superior performance (8% higher than second best baseline on ISIC2019) with significant resource savings (120× faster than FedAVG).

Conclusion: FedMedCLIP provides a feasible solution for medical image classification in federated learning settings with improved performance and reduced resource costs.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\times$ faster than FedAVG).

*Sida Huang,Siqi Huang,Ping Luo,Hongyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Laytrol Network for layout-to-image generation that preserves pretrained knowledge from base diffusion models by using synthesized data and careful parameter initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layout-to-image methods suffer from low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency due to loss of pretrained knowledge when integrating layout conditions into base generative models.

Method: Constructed LaySyn dataset using base model's synthesized images to reduce distribution shift, and proposed Laytrol Network with parameters inherited from MM-DiT, zero-initialized outputs, and Object-level Rotary Position Embedding for layout tokens.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating spatially consistent images while maintaining visual quality and style.

Conclusion: The Laytrol Network successfully addresses the challenge of spatial controllability in text-to-image generation while preserving the pretrained knowledge of base diffusion models.

Abstract: With the development of diffusion models, enhancing spatial controllability in text-to-image generation has become a vital challenge. As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Seyedehnanita Madani,Rama Chellappa,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffRegCD is a unified framework that integrates dense registration and change detection in a single model, using diffusion features and classification-based correspondence estimation to handle large misalignments in real-world imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world change detection faces challenges with parallax, viewpoint shifts, and temporal gaps causing severe misalignment. Traditional two-stage methods and recent joint frameworks struggle with large displacements, relying on limited registration approaches.

Method: Reformulates correspondence estimation as Gaussian smoothed classification for sub-pixel accuracy, leverages frozen multi-scale features from pretrained denoising diffusion models, and uses controlled affine perturbations on standard datasets for supervision without pseudo labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on aerial and ground-level datasets show DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation.

Conclusion: Diffusion features and classification-based correspondence provide a strong foundation for unified change detection, effectively handling misalignment challenges in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.

*Rui-Qing Sun,Ang Li,Zhijing Wu,Tian Lan,Qianyu Lu,Xingshan Yao,Chen Xu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISExplore is a segment selection strategy that identifies informative 5-second video segments for talking face generation, achieving 5x speedup in processing and training while maintaining high-fidelity output.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TFG methods require processing several minutes of reference video which takes hours, severely limiting practical applications. Exploratory studies showed that short informative segments can achieve comparable or better performance than full videos.

Method: Proposed ISExplore strategy that automatically selects informative 5-second segments based on three quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views.

Result: Achieves more than 5x speedup in data processing and training for both NeRF and 3DGS methods while maintaining high-fidelity talking face generation quality.

Conclusion: Video informative quality is more important than length, and the proposed ISExplore strategy enables efficient talking face generation with minimal reference video requirements.

Abstract: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to produce realistic and dynamic talking portraits, with broad applications in fields such as digital education, film and television production, e-commerce live streaming, and other related areas. Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning approach that uses bidirectional interaction between vision and language modalities to improve computational pathology analysis of whole slide images with only bag-level labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges of giga-pixel whole slide images and the limitations of existing vision-language MIL methods that use unidirectional guidance, which restricts cross-modal synergy.

Method: Uses frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions as text prototypes, learns instance-level vision prototypes to reduce data redundancy, and employs Stereoscopic Optimal Transport for fusion to enable broader semantic alignment.

Result: The method demonstrates superior generalization capabilities in few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional multimodal prototype learning approach effectively addresses computational pathology challenges and enhances model interpretability while achieving strong generalization performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReIDMamba is a pure Mamba-based person re-identification framework that addresses Transformer scalability issues by leveraging fine-grained global features through multiple class tokens, multi-granularity feature extraction, and ranking-aware triplet regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the scalability limitations of Transformer-based ReID methods, which suffer from quadratic memory and computational requirements, while maintaining robust discriminative feature extraction capabilities.

Method: Proposes a Mamba-based baseline with multiple class tokens, a multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) with multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, and ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) for feature diversity.

Result: ReIDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks with only one-third the parameters of TransReID, lower GPU memory usage, and faster inference throughput.

Conclusion: The pure Mamba-driven approach successfully addresses Transformer scalability issues while maintaining superior ReID performance, establishing a new efficient and effective paradigm for person re-identification.

Abstract: Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burst imaging creates redundancy leading to increased storage/transmission demands and reduced downstream task efficiency, necessitating quality assessment for frame selection.

Method: Proposes a unified BuIQA framework with task-driven prompt generation using heterogeneous knowledge distillation, and task-aware quality assessment network based on task prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios show impressive BuIQA performance, achieving 0.33 dB PSNR improvement in denoising and super-resolution tasks through high-quality burst frame selection.

Conclusion: The proposed BuIQA approach effectively assesses burst image quality for downstream tasks, enabling efficient frame selection and improving performance in applications like denoising and super-resolution.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of burst imaging technology has improved the capture and processing capabilities of visual data, enabling a wide range of applications. However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames.

### [37] [Multi-Modal Assistance for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation on Point Cloud 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07966)
*Shenao Zhao,Pengpeng Liang,Zhoufan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMAssist is a multi-modal domain adaptation method for 3D object detection that uses image and text features as bridges to align 3D features between source and target domains, improving performance through feature fusion and enhanced pseudo labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D UDA methods using teacher-student architectures with pseudo labels have shown improvements, but they largely ignore the usefulness of image data that is commonly collected alongside point clouds in real-world scenarios.

Method: The approach projects ground truth/pseudo labels to images to get 2D boxes, extracts image features from pre-trained vision backbone, uses LVLM for text descriptions and text encoder for text features, aligns 3D features with image/text features, fuses them with learned weights, and enhances pseudo labels using 2D detector outputs combined with teacher-generated pseudo labels.

Result: Experimental results show promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

Conclusion: MMAssist effectively leverages multi-modal assistance (images and text) to improve 3D domain adaptation performance through feature alignment and enhanced pseudo labeling strategies.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR-based 3D object detection (3D UDA) based on the teacher-student architecture with pseudo labels has achieved notable improvements in recent years. Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

TL;DR: A modular pipeline that improves robustness in remote sensing change detection by integrating diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement to handle spatial misalignment without modifying existing change detection networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing change detection faces challenges with spatial misalignment in bi-temporal images, especially with long seasonal or multi-year gaps. Existing models rely on precise co-registration and joint frameworks require retraining and transfer poorly across domains.

Method: The framework uses diffusion-based semantic morphing to synthesize intermediate frames bridging appearance gaps, enabling stepwise correspondence estimation. It then refines the composed flow through a lightweight U-Net to produce high-fidelity warping for co-registration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD datasets show consistent improvements in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection performance across multiple backbone networks.

Conclusion: The proposed modular approach demonstrates generality and effectiveness in improving spatial and temporal robustness for remote sensing change detection without requiring modifications to existing detection networks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is often challenged by spatial misalignment between bi-temporal images, especially when acquisitions are separated by long seasonal or multi-year gaps. While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: Existing point cloud completion methods assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision.

Method: Uses ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints to generate candidate points, then refines positions and predicts opacity scores via transformer decoder. Incorporates semantic guidance through lightweight classification head trained on geometric features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PCN and MVP benchmarks in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Conclusion: DANCE provides effective category-consistent completion without external image supervision, demonstrating superior performance in handling real-world point cloud completion challenges.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover missing geometric structures from incomplete 3D scans, which often suffer from occlusions or limited sensor viewpoints. Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels.

Method: SharpV uses a two-stage pruning framework: (1) adaptive pruning of visual tokens based on spatial-temporal information, and (2) KV cache pruning via self-calibration guided by similarity to original visual features, operating without requiring access to exposed attention scores.

Result: Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate SharpV's superiority, with the adaptive mechanism occasionally achieving performance gains over dense models while significantly reducing computational complexity.

Conclusion: SharpV offers a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning in VideoLLMs, providing hierarchical cache pruning from an information bottleneck perspective and ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Abstract: Current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) suffer from quadratic computational complexity and key-value cache scaling, due to their reliance on processing excessive redundant visual tokens. To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention.

Abstract: Egocentric visual query localization is vital for embodied AI and VR/AR, yet remains challenging due to camera motion, viewpoint changes, and appearance variations. We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space. Our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the Ego4D-VQ benchmark.

*Jian Wang,Lijun He,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRoad generates natural-looking road-style adversarial posters that can stealthily attack 3D object detectors in autonomous driving systems, causing them to perceive non-existent objects without drawing human attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual 3D detection models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing adversarial posters have unnatural appearances that are easily noticeable by humans and can be readily defended against.

Method: A two-stage approach: Road-Style Adversary Generation creates naturalistic road-style adversarial patterns, and Scenario-Associated Adaptation optimizes attack effectiveness while maintaining stealthy appearance.

Result: Extensive experiments show AdvRoad generalizes well across different detectors, scenes, and attack locations. Physical attacks demonstrate practical threats in real-world environments.

Conclusion: AdvRoad presents a significant security threat to autonomous driving systems by creating stealthy, natural-looking adversarial road patterns that can effectively compromise 3D object detection without human detection.

Abstract: Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments.

*Zhiyuan Chen,Yuelin Guo,Zitong Huang,Haoyu He,Renhao Lu,Weizhe Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cascade HQP-DETR addresses limitations in Imaginary Supervised Object Detection by introducing high-quality synthetic datasets, proposal-guided query encoding, and cascade denoising to achieve state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection requires large annotated datasets that are costly to create. Existing ISOD methods face issues with poor synthetic data quality, DETR's slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, and uniform denoising leading to noise overfitting.

Method: 1) High-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate FluxVOC/FluxCOCO datasets. 2) High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding with SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features. 3) Cascade denoising with progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers.

Result: Achieves SOTA 61.04% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007 after only 12 epochs training on FluxVOC, outperforming strong baselines and demonstrating competitive real-data performance.

Conclusion: Cascade HQP-DETR successfully advances ISOD from weak to full supervision, accelerates convergence, prevents overfitting to synthetic patterns, and learns robust boundaries, confirming the architecture's universal applicability.

Abstract: Object detection models demand large-scale annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to create. This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability.

*Chende Zheng,Ruiqi Suo,Zhoulin Ji,Jingyi Deng,Fangbin Yi,Chenhao Lin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework using Feature Pyramid-Transformer architecture that leverages cross-modal correlations between audio and video to identify and precisely localize synthetic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unimodal deepfake detection methods lack cross-modal correlation analysis and precise temporal localization capabilities, making them ineffective against sophisticated fine-grained manipulations in audio-visual content.

Method: Uses pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features, constructs multi-scale feature pyramid with R-TLM blocks and localized attention mechanisms, and employs dual-branch prediction for forgery probability and temporal offset refinement.

Result: Achieved a score of 0.7535 on the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark test set, demonstrating effective cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed FPN-Transformer framework provides an effective solution for generalized deepfake detection by leveraging cross-modal correlations and achieving precise temporal localization of manipulated segments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models has enabled the creation of highly realistic deepfake content, posing significant threats to digital trust across audio-visual domains. While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content under varying reconstruction conditions remains largely underexplored, despite factors like viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, and distortions significantly degrading visual quality.

Method: Created 3DGS-QA dataset with controlled distortions, then developed a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references, extracting spatial and photometric cues in a structure-aware manner.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing quality assessment methods, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in perceptual quality assessment for 3DGS, providing both a comprehensive dataset and an effective quality prediction model that operates directly on Gaussian representations, with publicly available dataset and code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D visualization, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for real-time, high-fidelity rendering. While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation. The dataset and code are made publicly available at https://github.com/diaoyn/3DGSQA to facilitate future research in 3DGS quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEDepth is a novel monocular depth estimation method that adapts Vision Foundation Models without modifying their structure or pretrained weights, using them as multi-level feature enhancers to inject prior knowledge at different representation levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation is challenging due to its ill-posed nature. Vision Foundation Models have shown remarkable world understanding capabilities that could benefit depth estimation, but current approaches typically require fine-tuning which modifies the original models.

Method: WEDepth uses Vision Foundation Models as multi-level feature enhancers without modifying their structures or pretrained weights. It systematically injects prior knowledge at different representation levels to elicit and leverage the models' inherent priors for depth estimation.

Result: Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving competitive results compared to diffusion-based approaches and methods pre-trained on relative depth. The method also exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capability across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: WEDepth demonstrates that Vision Foundation Models can be effectively adapted for monocular depth estimation without structural modifications, achieving state-of-the-art performance while preserving the original model capabilities and enabling strong transfer learning.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has widely applicable but remains highly challenging due to the inherently ill-posed nature of reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images. Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capability across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: Address high inter-observer variability in medical image segmentation where experts often disagree, moving beyond consensus masks or separate model branches for each annotator.

Method: Two-stage framework with probabilistic U-Net backbone to capture diverse expert hypotheses, prompt-guided projection mechanism for latent space navigation, and multi-level contrastive objective to align textual and visual representations.

Result: Reduces Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona on LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets.

Conclusion: Natural-language prompts provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation, demonstrating effective handling of expert variability.

Abstract: Automated medical image segmentation suffers from high inter-observer variability, particularly in tasks such as lung nodule delineation, where experts often disagree. Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona. These results demonstrate that natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation.

*Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukezic,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GECO2 is a novel few-shot counting and detection method that addresses scale issues in object detection by using dense query representation across multiple scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved speed and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot detection methods struggle with diverse-sized objects and densely populated small objects due to ad-hoc solutions like feature merging and image upsampling, which don't effectively handle scale variations.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end approach with dense query representation that gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales, creating high-resolution dense queries for detecting both large and small objects.

Result: GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters by 10% in both counting and detection accuracy, while running 3x faster with smaller GPU memory footprint.

Conclusion: The proposed dense query representation effectively addresses object scale issues in few-shot detection, enabling superior performance across diverse object sizes and densities.

Abstract: Few-shot detection-based counters estimate the number of instances in the image specified only by a few test-time exemplars. A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint.

Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between identity consistency and prompt diversity in subject-driven image generation by developing methods that preserve core identity features while enabling diverse contextual synthesis.

Method: LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model with latent concatenation strategy for joint processing of reference and target images, masked Conditional Flow Matching objective, two-stage distilled data curation framework (data restoration + VLM filtering → parameter-efficient fine-tuning), and CHARIS evaluation framework.

Result: The approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications and scales generation capability across various subjects and contexts through efficient data curation and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully balances identity consistency and prompt diversity in subject-driven image generation through innovative model architecture, data curation strategies, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation aims to synthesize novel depictions of a specific subject across diverse contexts while preserving its core identity features. Achieving both strong identity consistency and high prompt diversity presents a fundamental trade-off. We propose a LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model employing a latent concatenation strategy, which jointly processes reference and target images, combined with a masked Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) objective. This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts. Finally, for filtering and quality assessment, we present CHARIS, a fine-grained evaluation framework that performs attribute-level comparisons along five key axes: identity consistency, prompt adherence, region-wise color fidelity, visual quality, and transformation diversity.

TL;DR: Radar-APLANC is the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing that uses augmented pseudo-labels and noise contrastive learning to achieve performance comparable to supervised methods without requiring expensive labeled physiological data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods suffer from noise degradation, while learning-based methods require costly labeled signals for supervised training. There's a need for unsupervised approaches that can achieve noise robustness without expensive ground-truth data.

Method: Proposes Radar-APLANC framework using heartbeat range and noise range within radar range matrix to construct positive/negative samples. Uses Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss with pseudo-label signals from traditional radar methods. Implements pseudo-label augmentation with adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve signal quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on Equipleth dataset and collected radar dataset show the unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

Conclusion: Radar-APLANC successfully demonstrates that unsupervised radar-based heartbeat sensing can achieve competitive performance to supervised methods while eliminating the need for expensive labeled physiological data.

Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

*Cameron Braunstein,Mariya Toneva,Eddy Ilg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Stable Diffusion's internal representations contain meaningful semantic information during text-to-image generation, finding that semantic understanding primarily comes from CLIP text encoding rather than the diffusion process itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the extent to which latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have semantic understanding of the images they generate, and whether their internal representations contain human-meaningful semantic information.

Method: Performed probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects, evaluated against human annotations, and analyzed the contributions of CLIP text encoding versus the reverse diffusion process.

Result: Found that semantic understanding success is attributed to CLIP text encoding rather than the diffusion process; different semantic attributes have varying decoding accuracy; attributes become harder to disambiguate during inverse diffusion; CLIP provides the strongest semantic representation.

Conclusion: The separately trained CLIP vision-language model determines human-like semantic representation, while the diffusion process acts as a visual decoder rather than contributing to semantic understanding.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion achieve state-of-the-art results on text-to-image generation tasks. However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating identity preservation in generative models are inadequate - they rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight.

Method: A hierarchical evaluation framework that: (1) decomposes subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompts for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores, grounding VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence.

Result: The framework demonstrates strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency across four state-of-the-art generative models. A new benchmark with 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types and capturing 6-7 transformation axes per prompt was also introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical decomposition approach reduces hallucinations, improves consistency, and provides more fine-grained diagnostic insights for evaluating identity preservation in generative models compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Evaluating identity preservation in generative models remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models.

*Wassim Kabbani,Kiran Raja,Raghavendra Ramachandra,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableMorph is a diffusion-based method that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images to improve morphing attack detection evaluation by creating more challenging and realistic attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing morph generation methods produce blurry, artifact-riddled images that are easy to detect and don't represent real-world attack challenges, limiting the development of effective MAD systems.

Method: Uses modern diffusion-based image synthesis to generate full-head morphed face images with sharp details, avoiding visual flaws while offering control over visual attributes.

Result: StableMorph images rival or exceed genuine face image quality, maintain strong ability to fool face recognition systems, and pose greater challenges to existing MAD solutions.

Conclusion: StableMorph sets a new standard for morph quality, improves biometric security evaluation by creating more realistic attacks, and supports development of more robust detection systems.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten the integrity of biometric identity systems by enabling multiple individuals to share a single identity. To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset for face recognition security testing focuses on Nylon Face Masks (NFMs) - realistic 3D presentation attacks that mimic facial geometry, collected using iPhone 11 Pro with over 50,000 attack samples across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks, and NFMs represent a particularly concerning threat due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance that can closely mimic victims' facial geometry when worn by attackers.

Method: Created a novel dataset using iPhone 11 Pro, collecting 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. Benchmarked with five state-of-the-art PAD methods.

Result: Results show significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and the difficulty in detecting these sophisticated spoofing attacks.

Conclusion: NFMs present a serious threat to face recognition security, underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that can generalize effectively to emerging spoofing threats beyond traditional attack methods.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are increasingly deployed across a wide range of applications, including smartphone authentication, access control, and border security. However, these systems remain vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs), which can significantly compromise their reliability. In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats.

*Mehmet Batuhan Duman,Alejandro Carnero,Cristian Martín,Daniel Garrido,Manuel Díaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Federated Learning framework combined with SAM2 for automatic foam segmentation in wastewater treatment plants, enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training across multiple facilities without sharing sensitive data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foam formation in WTPs reduces treatment efficiency and increases costs, but standard ML models require large labeled datasets which are scarce and heterogeneous. Different WTPs don't share data due to privacy concerns, hindering system development.

Method: Combines Federated Learning with Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), using FL for collaborative training across multiple WTPs without centralizing data, and leveraging SAM2's pre-trained weights for initialization. Fine-tuned SAM2 on distributed clients using Flower framework with central Fog server aggregating model weights.

Result: The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets. Validated using real-world images from a WTP in Granada, synthetic foam dataset, and public datasets for generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs, demonstrating significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems for industrial challenges with distributed sensitive data.

Abstract: Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data.

TL;DR: OTSNet is a neurocognitive-inspired three-stage STR framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks through visual-linguistic alignment and cross-modal verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing STR frameworks suffer from decoupled visual-linguistic optimization leading to error propagation through cross-modal misalignment, with visual encoders having attention bias and decoders suffering from spatial misalignment on deformed text.

Method: Proposes OTSNet with three core components: Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) for refined visual features, Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) for spatial-semantic integration, and Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) for cross-modal self-correction.

Result: Achieves 83.5% average accuracy on Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on heavily occluded OST dataset, establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: OTSNet demonstrates superior performance through its neurocognitive-inspired hierarchical pipeline that effectively addresses cross-modal misalignment in scene text recognition.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains challenging due to real-world complexities, where decoupled visual-linguistic optimization in existing frameworks amplifies error propagation through cross-modal misalignment. Visual encoders exhibit attention bias toward background distractors, while decoders suffer from spatial misalignment when parsing geometrically deformed text-collectively degrading recognition accuracy for irregular patterns. Inspired by the hierarchical cognitive processes in human visual perception, we propose OTSNet, a novel three-stage network embodying a neurocognitive-inspired Observation-Thinking-Spelling pipeline for unified STR modeling. The architecture comprises three core components: (1) a Dual Attention Macaron Encoder (DAME) that refines visual features through differential attention maps to suppress irrelevant regions and enhance discriminative focus; (2) a Position-Aware Module (PAM) and Semantic Quantizer (SQ) that jointly integrate spatial context with glyph-level semantic abstraction via adaptive sampling; and (3) a Multi-Modal Collaborative Verifier (MMCV) that enforces self-correction through cross-modal fusion of visual, semantic, and character-level features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OTSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 83.5% average accuracy on the challenging Union14M-L benchmark and 79.1% on the heavily occluded OST dataset-establishing new records across 9 out of 14 evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: PEOD is the first large-scale, high-resolution (1280x720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenging conditions, containing 130+ sequences and 340k bounding boxes with 57% captured in extreme scenarios. Benchmarking shows fusion models perform best overall, but event-based models excel in illumination-challenged conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Event-RGB datasets have sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (≤640x480), preventing comprehensive evaluation of object detectors in challenging scenarios.

Method: Created PEOD dataset with 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes at 1280x720 resolution. Benchmarked 14 methods across three input configurations: Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion.

Result: Fusion-based models achieved excellent performance on full test set and normal subset. In illumination challenge subset, top event-based model outperformed all fusion models, though fusion models still outperformed RGB-based counterparts.

Conclusion: PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and reveals limitations of existing fusion methods when frame modality is severely degraded, facilitating future research.

Abstract: Robust object detection for challenging scenarios increasingly relies on event cameras, yet existing Event-RGB datasets remain constrained by sparse coverage of extreme conditions and low spatial resolution (<= 640 x 480), which prevents comprehensive evaluation of detectors under challenging scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose PEOD, the first large-scale, pixel-aligned and high-resolution (1280 x 720) Event-RGB dataset for object detection under challenge conditions. PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded. PEOD establishes a realistic, high-quality benchmark for multimodal perception and facilitates future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of expensive manual annotation in multimodal learning and the scarcity of annotated data, particularly in multimodal domain adaptation where different modalities experience varying domain shifts from source to target domains.

Method: Uses information bottleneck to learn representations for each modality independently, matches source and target domains with correlation alignment, formulates as multi-objective task for Pareto optimal solution, simplifies to quadratic programming problem with closed-form solution.

Result: Extensive empirical results show the proposed Boomda method outperforms competing schemes in multimodal domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Boomda provides an effective modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm that successfully addresses the challenge of varying domain shifts across different modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal learning, while contributing to numerous success stories across various fields, faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive manual annotation. To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm. The proposed method features \textbf{B}alanced multi-\textbf{o}bjective \textbf{o}ptimization for \textbf{m}ultimodal \textbf{d}omain \textbf{a}daptation, termed \textbf{Boomda}. Extensive empirical results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that Boomda outperforms the competing schemes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework for evaluating perceptual quality in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images, addressing the limitations of traditional FR-IQA and NR-IQA methods when references lack pixel-level alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Full-Reference IQA methods fail with misaligned references, while No-Reference IQA methods struggle with generalization. There's a need for a specialized framework that can handle the unique challenges of NVS where reference views share scene content but lack pixel-level alignment.

Method: Built a large-scale dataset with synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI). Used contrastive learning framework with LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings, supervised by existing IQA methods. Trained exclusively on synthetic distortions to avoid overfitting to specific NVS samples.

Result: The proposed NAR-IQA model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. User study showed strong correlation between model predictions and human subjective ratings.

Conclusion: The NAR-IQA framework effectively addresses the quality assessment challenges in Novel View Synthesis, providing superior performance and strong correlation with human perception, making it suitable for evaluating NVS images with non-aligned references.

Abstract: Evaluating the perceptual quality of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) images remains a key challenge, particularly in the absence of pixel-aligned ground truth references. Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

*Chenying Liu,Wei Huang,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LandSegmenter is a foundation model framework for Land Use and Land Cover mapping that addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, cross-modal feature extraction, and zero-shot transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LULC models are limited by modality specificity and fixed taxonomies, while foundation models require extensive labeled data that is costly in remote sensing. There's a need for universal models that can overcome data scarcity.

Method: Proposed LandSegmenter framework with three components: 1) LAS dataset with weak labels from existing LULC products, 2) RS-specific adapter for cross-modal features and text encoder for semantic awareness, 3) class-wise confidence-guided fusion for zero-shot performance.

Result: Evaluated on six LULC datasets with diverse modalities and taxonomies. Achieved competitive or superior performance in transfer learning and zero-shot settings, particularly when transferred to unseen datasets.

Conclusion: LandSegmenter demonstrates efficacy in building task-specific foundation models using weak supervision, enabling scalable LULC mapping across diverse domains without extensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping is a fundamental task in Earth Observation (EO). However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets. These results highlight the efficacy of our proposed framework and the utility of weak supervision for building task-specific FMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Mg-MRN, a multi-granularity mutual refinement network for zero-shot learning that enhances visual feature discriminability by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ZSL methods overlook intrinsic interactions between local region features, which could improve transferable and explicit visual feature acquisition for better unseen class recognition.

Method: Designs multi-granularity feature extraction for decoupled region feature mining, and cross-granularity feature fusion to strengthen interactions between region features of varying granularities.

Result: Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed Mg-MRN method.

Conclusion: Mg-MRN effectively refines discriminative and transferable visual features through multi-granularity learning and cross-granularity interactions, improving ZSL recognition performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes with zero samples by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes. Current approaches typically correlate global visual features with semantic information (i.e., attributes) or align local visual region features with corresponding attributes to enhance visual-semantic interactions. Although effective, these methods often overlook the intrinsic interactions between local region features, which can further improve the acquisition of transferable and explicit visual features. In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance. Extensive experiments on three popular ZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our proposed Mg-MRN method.

Result: Evaluated on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

Conclusion: Text-based reasoning enables interpretable video anomaly detection by representing video semantics through language, offering knowledge-grounded explanations while maintaining detection performance comparable to visual feature-based methods.

Abstract: We introduce Text-based Explainable Video Anomaly Detection (TbVAD), a language-driven framework for weakly supervised video anomaly detection that performs anomaly detection and explanation entirely within the textual domain. Unlike conventional WSVAD models that rely on explicit visual features, TbVAD represents video semantics through language, enabling interpretable and knowledge-grounded reasoning. The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel shadow generation framework using Keypoints Linear Model and Shadow Triangle Algorithm to create realistic and geometrically accurate shadows in image composition, especially for articulated human bodies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods like IC-Light still struggle to produce shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision in composite images, particularly for complex human poses.

Method: Proposes KPLM (Keypoints Linear Model) to model articulated human bodies using 9 keypoints and 1 bounding block for physically plausible shadow projection, combined with STA (Shadow Triangle Algorithm) for geometric accuracy through explicit formulations of shadow angles, lengths, and positions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly under complex human poses, and generalizes effectively to multi-directional relighting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations in existing shadow generation methods by combining physical modeling with geometric precision, enabling realistic shadow generation for articulated human bodies in image composition.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly integrate a foreground object into a background, where generating realistic and geometrically accurate shadows remains a persistent challenge. While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on shadow realism benchmarks, particularly under complex human poses, and generalizes effectively to multi-directional relighting scenarios such as those supported by IC-Light.

TL;DR: Proposes DistZSL framework for distributed zero-shot learning using decentralized data, addressing data heterogeneity with cross-node attribute regularization and global attribute-to-visual consensus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively learn zero-shot learning models from decentralized data while addressing data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes.

Method: Uses cross-node attribute regularizer to stabilize attribute feature space and global attribute-to-visual consensus to mitigate biased visual-to-attribute mappings across nodes.

Result: Extensive experiments show DistZSL achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for learning from distributed data.

Conclusion: The proposed DistZSL framework effectively handles data heterogeneity in distributed settings and enhances zero-shot learning performance across different nodes.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Distributed Zero-Shot Learning (DistZSL) framework that can fully exploit decentralized data to learn an effective model for unseen classes. Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DistZSL achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art in learning from distributed data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based anomaly detection methods rely on synthetic noise generation and require per-class model training, which limits generalization and scalability for multi-class real-world applications.

Method: Integrates pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) - VLM extracts detailed image descriptions using simple prompts, which serve as conditioning for LDM training to learn robust normal image feature representations for multi-class anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with significant improvements: increases pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed VLMDiff framework successfully enables scalable multi-class visual anomaly detection by leveraging vision-language models to provide conditioning information without manual annotations, demonstrating superior performance over existing diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in diverse, multi-class real-world images is a significant challenge. We introduce \ours, a novel unsupervised multi-class visual anomaly detection framework. It integrates a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for enhanced anomaly localization and detection. Specifically, a pre-trained VLM with a simple prompt extracts detailed image descriptions, serving as additional conditioning for LDM training. Current diffusion-based methods rely on synthetic noise generation, limiting their generalization and requiring per-class model training, which hinders scalability. \ours, however, leverages VLMs to obtain normal captions without manual annotations or additional training. These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

*Kaitao Huang,Yan Yan,Jing-Hao Xue,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WarpGAN introduces a warping-and-inpainting strategy to improve 3D GAN inversion for single-shot novel view synthesis, addressing poor quality in occluded regions by incorporating image inpainting with symmetry and multi-view consistency priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D GAN inversion methods focus on reconstructing visible regions but generate poor quality occluded regions due to information loss from low bit-rate latent codes, limiting realistic novel view synthesis.

Method: Proposes WarpGAN with three steps: 1) 3D GAN inversion encoder projects single-view image to latent code, 2) warping to novel view using 3D GAN's depth map, 3) SVINet uses symmetry prior and multi-view correspondence to inpaint occluded regions in warped images.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show WarpGAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality novel views with realistic occluded regions.

Conclusion: The warping-and-inpainting strategy effectively addresses occluded region quality issues in 3D GAN inversion, achieving superior single-shot novel view synthesis through symmetry and multi-view consistency priors.

Abstract: 3D GAN inversion projects a single image into the latent space of a pre-trained 3D GAN to achieve single-shot novel view synthesis, which requires visible regions with high fidelity and occluded regions with realism and multi-view consistency. However, existing methods focus on the reconstruction of visible regions, while the generation of occluded regions relies only on the generative prior of 3D GAN. As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

### [72] [Pixel-level Quality Assessment for Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08186)
*Yunhui Zhu,Buliao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PQA replaces box-level IoU prediction with pixel-level spatial consistency assessment to overcome structural coupling issues in oriented object detection, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict IoU between predicted and ground-truth boxes, but this suffers from structural coupling where predicted IoU can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes due to the inherent similarity between predicted boxes and estimated GT boxes.

Method: Proposes Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework that measures alignment between each pixel's relative position to predicted box and corresponding position to GT box, avoiding direct box comparison and eliminating similarity bias.

Result: Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA show PQA can be integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (+5.96% AP50:95 on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).

Conclusion: PQA provides a more accurate approximation of actual localization quality by operating at pixel level and eliminating structural coupling issues in box-level IoU prediction.

Abstract: Modern oriented object detectors typically predict a set of bounding boxes and select the top-ranked ones based on estimated localization quality. Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2Code$^\text{N}$ is a visual language model that introduces an interactive UI-to-code paradigm with multimodal coding capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance comparable to leading closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UI programming approaches have limitations in multimodal coding capabilities and lack iterative visual feedback, making them less effective for real-world workflows.

Method: The model uses staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to unify three capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing, with test-time scaling for interactive generation.

Result: UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes new state-of-the-art performance on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks, achieving results comparable to Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Conclusion: The interactive UI-to-code paradigm with multimodal coding capabilities significantly improves UI programming performance and better reflects real-world development workflows.

Abstract: User interface (UI) programming is a core yet highly complex part of modern software development. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSViT is a novel deep learning framework using Transformers for modulo video recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance by reconstructing high-quality videos from 8-bit folded data through selective spatiotemporal processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range causing saturation in HDR scenes, while existing modulo cameras require specialized unwrapping algorithms. Progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in applying modern deep learning techniques, and standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery.

Method: Proposed Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT) - the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. It uses Transformers to capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships, employing a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and focus on critical regions.

Result: SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery, as confirmed by experiments.

Conclusion: Transformers can effectively capture the global dependencies needed for modulo recovery, and the proposed SSViT framework successfully addresses the challenges of modulo video reconstruction through selective spatiotemporal processing.

Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a loss function for open-set recognition in medical imaging that uses auxiliary datasets to penalize open space regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-aided diagnoses face challenges in real-world settings due to limited data availability from ethical/legal restrictions and high annotation costs, especially for emerging or rare diseases. Open-set recognition is crucial for identifying unknown classes not seen during training.

Method: Introduces a loss function that effectively rejects unknown class samples by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets, leveraging the observation that features in deep neural networks cluster around class means arranged as vertices of a regular simplex.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains across four MedMNIST datasets (BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST) and a publicly available skin dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses open-set recognition challenges in medical imaging by leveraging auxiliary datasets and geometric properties of feature representations, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Driven by advancements in deep learning, computer-aided diagnoses have made remarkable progress. However, outside controlled laboratory settings, algorithms may encounter several challenges. In the medical domain, these difficulties often stem from limited data availability due to ethical and legal restrictions, as well as the high cost and time required for expert annotations-especially in the face of emerging or rare diseases. In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets. This approach achieves significant performance gain across four MedMNIST datasets-BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST and a publicly available skin dataset [29] outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a canonical view bias in image-to-3D generative models, showing that state-of-the-art models like Hunyuan3D 2.0 struggle with rotated inputs and proposes a lightweight CNN solution to detect and correct orientation without modifying the main model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale image-to-3D generative models lack transparency in their inductive biases, particularly regarding viewpoint generalization. The authors aim to understand and address limitations in how these models handle rotated inputs.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations on the Hunyuan3D 2.0 model. Proposed a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation to restore model performance without changing the generative backbone.

Result: The experiments revealed that state-of-the-art 3D generative models exhibit strong canonical view bias, with performance degrading significantly under rotated inputs. The proposed lightweight CNN successfully mitigated this failure by correcting input orientation.

Conclusion: The findings question whether scale alone is sufficient for robust 3D generation and suggest the need for modular, symmetry-aware designs in future image-to-3D generative models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive results, large-scale image-to-3D generative models remain opaque in their inductive biases. We identify a significant limitation in image-conditioned 3D generative models: a strong canonical view bias. Through controlled experiments using simple 2D rotations, we show that the state-of-the-art Hunyuan3D 2.0 model can struggle to generalize across viewpoints, with performance degrading under rotated inputs. We show that this failure can be mitigated by a lightweight CNN that detects and corrects input orientation, restoring model performance without modifying the generative backbone. Our findings raise an important open question: Is scale enough, or should we pursue modular, symmetry-aware designs?

TL;DR: This paper presents a comparative evaluation of a multimodal pipeline for food recognition, combining EfficientNet-B4 visual backbone with Gemini LLM for nutritional analysis and recipe generation. The study introduces Semantic Error Propagation analysis and uses a Custom Chinese Food Dataset to address cultural bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for robust automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance in digital food applications, while evaluating trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and generative output quality.

Method: Developed a decoupled multimodal pipeline integrating specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with generative LLM (Gemini). Benchmarked against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and lightweight LLM (Gemma). Introduced Semantic Error Propagation (SEP) analysis and used Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) to address cultural bias.

Result: EfficientNet-B4 achieved 89.0% Top-1 accuracy with best balance of accuracy and efficiency. Gemini provided superior generative quality with 9.2/10 factual accuracy. System utility is bottlenecked by visual front-end's perceptive accuracy, with high semantic similarity identified as the most critical failure mode.

Conclusion: While the multimodal pipeline shows promise, the overall system performance is fundamentally limited by the visual classification accuracy, particularly for foods with high semantic similarity, highlighting the need for improved visual perception in food recognition systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food applications necessitates robust methods for automated nutritional analysis and culinary guidance. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of a decoupled, multimodal pipeline for food recognition. We evaluate a system integrating a specialized visual backbone (EfficientNet-B4) with a powerful generative large language model (Google's Gemini LLM). The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for "Semantic Error Propagation" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy. We conduct a detailed per-class analysis, identifying high semantic similarity as the most critical failure mode.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for point cloud surface reconstruction that adaptively adjusts local region spacing and size based on curvature, improving accuracy and efficiency over uniform approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use uniform local regions with fixed sizes, which limits adaptability to varying geometric complexity in point clouds.

Method: Adaptively modulates spacing and size of local regions based on input point cloud curvature.

Result: Improved reconstruction accuracy and efficiency compared to uniform approaches.

Conclusion: Curvature-based adaptive local region modulation enhances point cloud surface reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Point cloud surface reconstruction has improved in accuracy with advances in deep learning, enabling applications such as infrastructure inspection. Recent approaches that reconstruct from small local regions rather than entire point clouds have attracted attention for their strong generalization capability. However, prior work typically places local regions uniformly and keeps their size fixed, limiting adaptability to variations in geometric complexity. In this study, we propose a method that improves reconstruction accuracy and efficiency by adaptively modulating the spacing and size of local regions based on the curvature of the input point cloud.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language fine-tuning methods overlook semantic relationships in images that are often highlighted in textual context, leading to suboptimal multimodal alignment performance.

Method: Extracts multilevel semantic features from vision encoders, projects vision features to group related semantics, and fuses visual-textual features using inheritable cross-attention that globally removes redundant visual relationships by discarding low-correlation feature pairs.

Result: The method was evaluated on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks (visual question answering and image captioning), demonstrating superior performance over all existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves multimodal alignment and fusion by incorporating both semantics and relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance on vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient paradigm for constructing multimodal foundation models. While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPVNet is a novel point cloud processing method that addresses rotational variations through direction-perceptive vector networks, using atomic dot-product operators to encode directional selectivity and rotation invariance at both local and global levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary rotations disrupt point clouds' intrinsic directional characteristics, posing challenges for representation learning. Existing methods fail to fully exploit multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations.

Method: Proposes Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet) with: 1) Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator for adaptive capture of non-uniform local structures; 2) Global directional response spectrum via direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT) for modeling holistic directional structures.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios with noise and large-angle rotations.

Conclusion: DiPVNet effectively addresses rotational variations in point clouds through direction-perceptive operators that simultaneously provide rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception, demonstrating superior performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: NERVE is a training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation method that integrates global and local information using stable diffusion self-attention, employs stochastic random walk for affinity refinement instead of fixed Gaussian kernels, and uses entropy-based uncertainty to select relevant attention maps without requiring CRF or PAMR post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free OVSS methods have limitations including computationally expensive affinity refinement, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps with equal weighting or fixed-size Gaussian kernels that enforce isotropic neighborhoods.

Method: Integrates global and fine-grained local information from stable diffusion self-attention, uses stochastic random walk for affinity refinement instead of fixed Gaussian kernels, and employs entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant attention maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks without requiring conventional post-processing techniques like CRF or PAMR.

Conclusion: NERVE provides an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by effectively delineating objects with arbitrary shapes through spatial diffusion and intelligent attention map selection.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS), existing training-free methods face several limitations: use of computationally expensive affinity refinement strategies, ineffective fusion of transformer attention maps due to equal weighting or reliance on fixed-size Gaussian kernels to reinforce local spatial smoothness, enforcing isotropic neighborhoods. We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-object image editing methods follow localize-editing paradigm but neglect critical inter-object interactions, leading to editing leakage or constraints due to attention entanglements in conflict regions.

Method: Proposes a "decompose-editing-fusion" framework with: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition using attention-aware IoU and time-dependent region removing; (2) Object-layered Editing with coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping; (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion for structure-coherent inter-object fusion.

Conclusion: LayerEdit enables conflict-free object-layered editing through precise layer decomposition and coherent fusion, effectively solving the problem of attention entanglements in multi-object image editing.

Abstract: Text-driven multi-object image editing which aims to precisely modify multiple objects within an image based on text descriptions, has recently attracted considerable interest. Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel "decompose-editingfusion" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Generating ground-level images from aerial views is a challenging task due to extreme viewpoint disparity, occlusions, and a limited field of view. We introduce Top2Ground, a novel diffusion-based method that directly generates photorealistic ground-view images from aerial input images without relying on intermediate representations such as depth maps or 3D voxels. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content. We evaluate Top2Ground on three diverse datasets: CVUSA, CVACT, and the Auto Arborist.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageBindDC is a novel multimodal data condensation framework that uses Characteristic Function loss in ImageBind's unified feature space to preserve inter-modal dependencies through uni-modal, cross-modal, and joint-modal distribution alignment, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal condensed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data condensation techniques fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial, necessitating a new approach that can effectively capture and maintain these complex relationships in condensed datasets.

Method: The framework operates in ImageBind's unified feature space and employs Characteristic Function loss in the Fourier domain for precise statistical alignment via infinite moment matching. It enforces three levels of distributional consistency: uni-modal alignment, cross-modal alignment, and joint-modal alignment.

Result: On NYU-v2 dataset, models trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieve lossless performance comparable to full dataset training, with 8.2% absolute improvement over previous best method and more than 4× less condensation time.

Conclusion: ImageBindDC effectively addresses multimodal data condensation challenges by preserving inter-modal dependencies through comprehensive distribution alignment, setting new state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing condensation time.

Abstract: Data condensation techniques aim to synthesize a compact dataset from a larger one to enable efficient model training, yet while successful in unimodal settings, they often fail in multimodal scenarios where preserving intricate inter-modal dependencies is crucial. To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\times$ less condensation time.

TL;DR: ESC framework unifies event-RGB features using edge cues for robust semantic segmentation in extreme conditions, addressing modality heterogeneity through edge-aware latent re-coding and uncertainty optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic segmentation methods fail in extreme conditions (low light, camera motion) due to RGB information loss, while event-RGB fusion suffers from feature-level mismatch and heterogeneous modality issues.

Method: Proposes Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework with Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding to align event-RGB features using edge dictionary clues, and Re-coded Consolidation with Uncertainty Optimization for heterogeneous fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 2.55% mIoU on DERS-XS dataset and shows superior resilience under spatial occlusion in extreme scenarios.

Conclusion: The ESC framework effectively addresses event-RGB heterogeneity through edge-aware feature unification, providing robust semantic segmentation performance in challenging conditions.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

Abstract: The annotation of large scale histopathology image datasets remains a major bottleneck in developing robust deep learning models for clinically relevant tasks, such as mitotic figure classification. Folder-based annotation workflows are usually slow, fatiguing, and difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce SWipeable ANnotations (SWAN), an open-source, MIT-licensed web application that enables intuitive image patch classification using a swiping gesture. SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices. These results suggest that SWAN can accelerate image annotation while maintaining annotation quality, offering a scalable and user-friendly alternative to conventional workflows.

Result: Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness and generalization ability across diverse fusion tasks. The approach enhances both performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MAUGIF provides a mechanism-aware framework that addresses the limitations of existing fusion methods by adapting to different fusion mechanisms, offering improved performance and generalization across various image fusion applications.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate structural and complementary information from multi-source images. However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MAUGIF.

Motivation: Current weather data approaches are limited to single-variable, single-region tasks using deterministic modeling, which restricts unified synthesis across variables/regions, overlooks cross-variable complementarity, and produces over-smoothed results.

Method: Introduces SynWeatherDiff, a general probabilistic weather synthesis model built on the Diffusion Transformer framework to handle multi-region, multi-variable weather data synthesis and address over-smoothing issues.

Result: Experiments on the SynWeather dataset show the model's effectiveness compared to both task-specific and general models, demonstrating improved performance in unified weather data synthesis.

Conclusion: SynWeather enables unified multi-region and multi-variable weather observation synthesis, while SynWeatherDiff provides a probabilistic solution that overcomes limitations of deterministic approaches and produces more realistic weather data.

Abstract: With the advancement of meteorological instruments, abundant data has become available. Current approaches are typically focus on single-variable, single-region tasks and primarily rely on deterministic modeling. This limits unified synthesis across variables and regions, overlooks cross-variable complementarity and often leads to over-smoothed results. To address above challenges, we introduce SynWeather, the first dataset designed for Unified Multi-region and Multi-variable Weather Observation Data Synthesis. SynWeather covers four representative regions: the Continental United States, Europe, East Asia, and Tropical Cyclone regions, as well as provides high-resolution observations of key weather variables, including Composite Radar Reflectivity, Hourly Precipitation, Visible Light, and Microwave Brightness Temperature. In addition, we introduce SynWeatherDiff, a general and probabilistic weather synthesis model built upon the Diffusion Transformer framework to address the over-smoothed problem. Experiments on the SynWeather dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our network compared with both task-specific and general models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkelSplat is a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation that uses differentiable Gaussian rendering to model human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, enabling view fusion without 3D ground-truth supervision and showing strong generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view methods rely on large annotated datasets and fail to generalize when test scenarios differ from training data, limiting their practical applicability in real-world settings.

Method: Models human pose as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians (one per joint) with differentiable rendering optimization. Introduces a novel one-hot encoding scheme to enable independent joint optimization, adapting Gaussian Splatting from dense scene reconstruction to human pose estimation.

Result: Outperforms approaches without 3D ground truth on Human3.6M and CMU datasets, reduces cross-dataset error by up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods, and demonstrates robustness to occlusions without scenario-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SkelSplat provides an effective framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation that generalizes well across datasets and handles occlusions robustly, without requiring 3D ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation is fundamental for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction. State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning. Our project page is available here: https://skelsplat.github.io.

TL;DR: NeuSpring is a neural spring field method that creates physical digital twins of deformable objects from videos, achieving better reconstruction and simulation performance for both current state modeling and future prediction compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for physical digital twins of deformable objects focus on current state modeling but generalize poorly to future prediction because they ignore intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, leading to limited physical learning.

Method: NeuSpring uses a neural spring field built upon spring-mass models with two innovations: 1) piecewise topology solution for multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization to handle material heterogeneity, and 2) neural spring field representing spring physical properties across frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network to leverage spatial associativity.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show NeuSpring achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% for current state modeling and 25% for future prediction.

Conclusion: NeuSpring effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating intrinsic physical properties through neural spring fields, enabling better physical learning and generalization to future predictions for deformable object digital twins.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to create physical digital twins of deformable objects under interaction. Existing methods focus more on the physical learning of current state modeling, but generalize worse to future prediction. This is because existing methods ignore the intrinsic physical properties of deformable objects, resulting in the limited physical learning in the current state modeling. To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our NeuSping achieves superior reconstruction and simulation performance for current state modeling and future prediction, with Chamfer distance improved by 20% and 25%, respectively.

*Simone Ricci,Niccolò Biondi,Federico Pernici,Alberto Del Bimbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce negative flips (where updated AI models misclassify previously correct samples) in image classification by preserving original model margins while learning new classes, using margin-calibration and double-source focal distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive AI versions is crucial, especially as adding new training classes reduces class margins and introduces conflicting patterns that degrade performance on original classes through negative flips.

Method: Proposes margin preservation with explicit margin-calibration on logits, combined with double-source focal distillation using both previous model and new independently trained model to learn appropriate decision margins from old and new data.

Result: Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks show the approach consistently reduces negative flip rate while maintaining high overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates negative flips in model updates by balancing margin preservation for original classes with appropriate learning of new classes through calibrated distillation.

Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

TL;DR: Image-based registration outperforms feature-based and implicit alignment methods for longitudinal mammography risk modeling, providing better predictive accuracy and anatomically plausible deformation fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early breast cancer detection through personalized screening intervals using deep learning risk models, addressing the challenge of accurate spatial alignment across longitudinal mammograms which is crucial for detecting meaningful tissue changes.

Method: Evaluated various alignment strategies including image-based registration, feature-level alignment with/without regularization, and implicit alignment methods on two large-scale mammography datasets, assessing predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.

Result: Image-based registration consistently outperformed other methods across all metrics, enabling more accurate and temporally consistent predictions with smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Feature-level alignment with regularization improved deformation quality but reduced risk prediction performance.

Conclusion: Image-based deformation fields are essential for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness for personalized breast cancer screening and earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

Abstract: Regular mammography screening is crucial for early breast cancer detection. By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.
  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.
  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

TL;DR: A novel diffusion-based data augmentation method called SASG-DA is proposed for sEMG-based gesture recognition, addressing data scarcity issues through semantic-guided generation and sparse-aware sampling to improve faithfulness and targeted diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: sEMG-based gesture recognition systems suffer from limited training data, causing overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation can help but faces challenges in balancing faithfulness and diversity, with untargeted diversity often creating redundant samples.

Method: SASG-DA uses three key strategies: 1) Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) for faithful generation using task-aware semantic representations, 2) Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) for flexible diverse sampling, and 3) Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling to explore underrepresented regions for better distribution coverage.

Result: Extensive experiments on Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7 datasets show SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods, effectively mitigating overfitting and improving recognition performance and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed SASG-DA approach successfully addresses data scarcity in sEMG-based gesture recognition by generating both faithful and diverse samples through semantic-guided diffusion augmentation, leading to improved model performance and generalization.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG)-based gesture recognition plays a critical role in human-machine interaction (HMI), particularly for rehabilitation and prosthetic control. However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.

TL;DR: SLOPE is a unified framework that effectively combines structured sparsity and low-bit quantization to reduce DNN model size while maintaining accuracy, overcoming the compounded negative effects when these techniques are naively combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are computationally expensive for resource-constrained devices. While weight quantization and structured sparsity are effective individually, their combination typically harms model accuracy due to compounded negative impacts.

Method: Proposes SLOPE framework with training-time regularization that minimizes discrepancy between full-precision weights and sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

Result: On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves ~20× model size reduction while retaining ~99% of original accuracy. Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on various models.

Conclusion: SLOPE provides a principled way to combine structured sparsity and quantization, enabling significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy across diverse computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are used in many applications, but their large size and high computational cost make them hard to run on devices with limited resources. Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\sim20\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\sim$99% of the original accuracy. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art quantization and structured sparsity methods across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on models such as ResNet-18, ViT-Small, and Mask R-CNN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrospective motion correction methods struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions, with ML-based approaches often being tailored to specific applications and datasets. The authors hypothesize that motion artifacts share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited.

Method: Propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns disentangled embeddings of motion-to-clean image features using a codebook to capture finite motion patterns at multiple resolutions. An auto-regressive model learns the prior distribution of motion-free images and guides the correction process at inference.

Result: The method demonstrates robust correction across varying motion severity on simulated whole-body motion artifacts. The model effectively disentangled physical motion from simulated motion-effective scans, improving generalizability of ML-based MRI motion correction.

Conclusion: The approach successfully disentangles motion features without requiring artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns, showing potential for application across different anatomical regions and motion types.

Abstract: Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.

### [99] [A Circular Argument : Does RoPE need to be Equivariant for Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08368)
*Chase van de Geijn,Timo Lüddecke,Polina Turishcheva,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper questions the importance of strict positional equivariance in Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) for computer vision, showing that non-equivariant alternatives like Spherical RoPE perform equally well or better than equivariant versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common belief that relative positional embeddings (equivariance) are crucial for RoPE's success, particularly when extending RoPE to higher-dimensional data like images and videos.

Method: Proposed Spherical RoPE, which uses non-commutative generators instead of the commutative generators required for strict equivariance in Mixed RoPE, and compared its performance against equivariant analogues.

Result: Empirical findings show Spherical RoPE has equivalent or better learning behavior compared to equivariant versions, suggesting strict positional equivariance may not be as important as previously thought for computer vision applications.

Conclusion: Relative positional embeddings may not be as critical as commonly believed in computer vision, opening opportunities for faster and better-generalizing positional encodings that don't require strict equivariance.

Abstract: Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.

*Sorachi Kato,Ryoma Yataka,Pu Perry Wang,Pedro Miraldo,Takuya Fujihashi,Petros Boufounos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPTR is a radar-based 3D human pose estimation method that uses weak supervision with only 3D bounding boxes and 2D keypoints, eliminating the need for expensive 3D keypoint labels. It employs a two-stage transformer architecture with pseudo-3D deformable attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance on indoor radar datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation requires costly fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are difficult to obtain in complex indoor environments with clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. The authors aim to develop a more scalable approach using only easier-to-collect 3D bounding boxes and 2D keypoint labels.

Method: RAPTR uses a two-stage pose decoder architecture with pseudo-3D deformable attention: 1) A pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses using a 3D template loss that leverages 3D bounding box labels to mitigate depth ambiguities; 2) A joint decoder refines the initial poses using 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss.

Result: RAPTR significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by 34.3% on the HIBER dataset and 76.9% on the MMVR dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed RAPTR framework demonstrates that effective 3D human pose estimation from radar data can be achieved using only weak supervision (3D bounding boxes and 2D keypoints), making the approach more scalable and practical for real-world indoor applications.

Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained details crucial for disease diagnosis, while clinicians analyze images using anatomical structures as important regions of interest with their medical knowledge.

Method: The model localizes key anatomical features from medical images, enriches these regions with structured knowledge for context-aware interpretation, and aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease predictions.

Result: Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets, validates well on downstream image segmentation tasks, and demonstrates that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge.

Conclusion: Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities for radiology image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate disease interpretation from radiology remains challenging due to imaging heterogeneity. Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.

### [103] [OmniAID: Decoupling Semantic and Artifacts for Universal AI-Generated Image Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08423)
*Yuncheng Guo,Junyan Ye,Chenjue Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Haohuan Fu,Conghui He,Weijia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniAID is a novel AIGI detection framework that uses a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture to separate content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, achieving superior generalization across diverse generative models and semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGI detectors learn entangled forgery representations that conflate content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts, and are limited by outdated benchmarks, failing to generalize across diverse generative models and semantic content.

Method: Proposes OmniAID with a hybrid expert system featuring Routable Specialized Semantic Experts for distinct domains and a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert, trained using a two-stage strategy with domain-specific hard-sampling and lightweight gating network for input routing.

Result: Extensive experiments using traditional benchmarks and the new Mirage dataset demonstrate that OmniAID surpasses existing monolithic detectors and establishes a new robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern threats.

Conclusion: By explicitly decoupling content-specific flaws from universal artifacts, OmniAID achieves robust generalization and provides a more effective solution for universal AIGI detection in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: A truly universal AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detector must simultaneously generalize across diverse generative models and varied semantic content. Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling "what is generated" (content-specific flaws) from "how it is generated" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats.

TL;DR: A hybrid consistency learning approach for semi-supervised medical image segmentation using Dual Branch Pyramid Network with Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization to effectively leverage unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation by developing a method that can effectively utilize large amounts of unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning.

Method: Proposes DBPNet with encoder and two slightly different decoders producing pyramid predictions, combined with CPCR learning strategy that integrates consistency learning, uncertainty minimization, and novel cross-pyramid regularization for knowledge distillation in deep features.

Result: DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and achieves comparable performance with recent methods on public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid consistency learning approach with cross-pyramid regularization effectively exploits unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enables training of powerful models with the assumption of limited, carefully labelled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to support the learning. In this paper, we propose a hybrid consistency learning approach to effectively exploit unlabeled data for semi-supervised medical image segmentation by leveraging Cross-Pyramid Consistency Regularization (CPCR) between two decoders. First, we design a hybrid Dual Branch Pyramid Network (DBPNet), consisting of an encoder and two decoders that differ slightly, each producing a pyramid of perturbed auxiliary predictions across multiple resolution scales. Second, we present a learning strategy for this network named CPCR that combines existing consistency learning and uncertainty minimization approaches on the main output predictions of decoders with our novel regularization term. More specifically, in this term, we extend the soft-labeling setting to pyramid predictions across decoders to support knowledge distillation in deep hierarchical features. Experimental results show that DBPNet with CPCR outperforms five state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods and has comparable performance with recent ones on a public benchmark dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To decouple comprehensive semantic understanding from discriminative feature learning in vision-language models, enabling more efficient and effective embedding generation.

Method: Proposes CoMa - a compressed pre-training phase that serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning, requiring only small amounts of pre-training data to adapt VLMs into embedding models.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on MMEB benchmark, demonstrating optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The compressed pre-training approach successfully transforms VLMs into competitive embedding models while maintaining efficiency, showing that comprehensive understanding facilitates better downstream task performance through contrastive learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models advance multimodal representation learning by acquiring transferable semantic embeddings, thereby substantially enhancing performance across a range of vision-language tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning for 3D medical image segmentation is computationally expensive, and existing classifiers face speed-accuracy trade-offs, requiring a faster yet accurate solution.

Method: Hierarchical sparse sampling strategy to reduce computation while preserving context, combined with Residual Transformer architecture to extract and combine multi-level information efficiently.

Result: Improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance on 10,253 CT images and TotalSegmentator dataset, achieving ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware.

Conclusion: The method enables fast multi-organ segmentation with potential for real-time clinical applications, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation of 3D medical images is fundamental with meaningful applications in various clinical automation pipelines. Although deep learning has achieved superior performance, the time and memory consumption of segmenting the entire 3D volume voxel by voxel using neural networks can be huge. Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware. The potential of achieving real-time fine organ segmentation is suggested.

Conclusion: UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for next-generation multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Motivation: To improve digital communication accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals by leveraging 3D sign language data instead of 2D video, and to expand LLMs' capabilities beyond text-based inputs to understand embodied multimodal languages.

Method: Uses Large Language Models as backbone, processes 3D sign language data to capture spatial, gestural, and depth information, with both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and instruction-guided translation modulated by external prompts.

Result: Enables more accurate and resilient ASL translation by utilizing rich 3D spatial information, providing flexibility through different translation approaches.

Conclusion: This work represents a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of human communication beyond text.

Abstract: We present Large Sign Language Models (LSLM), a novel framework for translating 3D American Sign Language (ASL) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone, which can benefit hearing-impaired individuals' virtual communication. Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility. This work provides a foundational step toward inclusive, multimodal intelligent systems capable of understanding diverse forms of language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF-based methods require accurate camera poses and use implicit representations incompatible with standard 3D software, limiting their practicality for robotic applications like navigation and manipulation.

Method: Jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures geometric detail and photorealistic appearance, producing editable 3D meshes.

Result: Achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty on standard benchmarks, producing meshes compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications by providing robust mesh reconstruction that works with noisy camera poses and standard 3D software.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for downstream robotic tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and environment understanding. However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.

*Parshwa Shah,Dhaval K. Patel,Brijesh Soni,Miguel López-Benítez,Siddhartan Govindasamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for UE positioning using Angle Delay Profile from CSI matrix, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL techniques for UE positioning have limitations: they apply uniform attention to entire inputs and are not well-suited for non-sequential data like instantaneous CSI.

Method: An attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on Angle Delay Profile (ADP) extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) matrix.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.55m indoors and 13.59m outdoors on DeepMIMO dataset, and 3.45m on ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. Outperformed state-of-the-art by ~38% and showed better error distance distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-based ViT architecture effectively addresses limitations of existing DL approaches for UE positioning and demonstrates superior performance across different scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for User Equipment (UE) positioning. However, the key shortcomings of such models is that: i) they weigh the same attention to the entire input; ii) they are not well suited for the non-sequential data e.g., when only instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) is available. In this context, we propose an attention-based Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that focuses on the Angle Delay Profile (ADP) from CSI matrix. Our approach, validated on the `DeepMIMO' and `ViWi' ray-tracing datasets, achieves an Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.55m indoors, 13.59m outdoors in DeepMIMO, and 3.45m in ViWi's outdoor blockage scenario. The proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by $\sim$ 38\%. It also performs substantially better than other approaches that we have considered in terms of the distribution of error distance.

### [114] [SENCA-st: Integrating Spatial Transcriptomics and Histopathology with Cross Attention Shared Encoder for Region Identification in Cancer Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08573)
*Shanaka Liyanaarachchi,Chathurya Wijethunga,Shihab Aaquil Ahamed,Akthas Absar,Ranga Rodrigo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SENCA-st is a novel architecture that integrates histopathology images and spatial transcriptomics data using cross-attention to preserve features from both modalities and detect functionally different regions with structural similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for integrating histopathology and spatial transcriptomics data either overemphasize spatial transcriptomics (losing structural information) or histopathology (losing functional information), leading to loss of essential information in tumor substructure analysis.

Method: Proposed SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) architecture that uses cross-attention to emphasize regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different in spatial transcriptomics, preserving features from both modalities.

Result: The model demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions.

Conclusion: SENCA-st effectively integrates structural and functional information from histopathology and spatial transcriptomics, providing improved detection of clinically crucial tumor regions and heterogeneity.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging field that enables the identification of functional regions based on the spatial distribution of gene expression. Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, few studies have examined RAG for Taiwanese Historical Archives. In this paper, we present an initial study of a RAG pipeline applied to two historical Traditional Chinese datasets, Fort Zeelandia and the Taiwan Provincial Council Gazette, along with their corresponding open-ended query sets. We systematically investigate the effects of query characteristics and metadata integration strategies on retrieval quality, answer generation, and the performance of the overall system. The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.

*Fatemeh Shahhosseini,Arash Marioriyad,Ali Momen,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Shaghayegh Haghjooy Javanmard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey synthesizes methods for using large language models (LLMs) in scientific idea generation, categorizing approaches into five families and analyzing them through creativity frameworks to understand how they balance novelty with scientific soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific idea generation is crucial for discovery but challenging due to its multi-objective, open-ended nature requiring both novelty and empirical soundness. While LLMs show promise in generating scientific ideas, their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood.

Method: The survey categorizes LLM-driven scientific ideation methods into five families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. It analyzes these using Boden's creativity taxonomy (Combinatorial, Exploratory, Transformational) and Rhodes' 4Ps framework (Person, Process, Press, Product).

Result: The structured synthesis provides clarity on how different methodological approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness, revealing which methods emphasize different aspects or sources of creativity and what level of ideas they're expected to generate.

Conclusion: By aligning methodological advances with creativity frameworks, this survey clarifies the state of LLM-driven scientific ideation and outlines key directions toward developing reliable, systematic, and transformative applications of LLMs in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation lies at the heart of scientific discovery and has driven human progress-whether by solving unsolved problems or proposing novel hypotheses to explain unknown phenomena. Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes. By aligning methodological advances with creativity frameworks, this survey clarifies the state of the field and outlines key directions toward reliable, systematic, and transformative applications of LLMs in scientific discovery.

*Jiarui Feng,Donghong Cai,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRIP is a framework that enables LLMs to internalize graph knowledge through fine-tuning with LoRA parameters, allowing graph-related tasks without needing the original graph at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for adapting LLMs to structural data like graphs face challenges including token overhead, complex training procedures, and poor modality alignment.

Method: Uses carefully designed fine-tuning tasks to inject graph knowledge into LLMs through lightweight LoRA parameters, inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

Conclusion: GRIP provides an effective solution for equipping LLMs with graph reasoning capabilities while maintaining efficiency and avoiding inference-time graph access requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling sequential textual data and generalizing across diverse tasks. However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

REFLEX uses LLMs as zero-shot evaluators to assess summary quality along dimensions such as relevance, informativeness, and coherence, without requiring gold-standard references or human annotations. We show that REFLEX produces stable, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluations across multiple log summarization dataset, and more effectively distinguishes model outputs than traditional metrics.

Motivation: To develop an effective approach for terminology-constrained machine translation that balances terminology adherence with translation quality, addressing the limitations of strict constraint enforcement methods.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) Terminology-aware NMT model fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic data, 2) Prompt-based LLM for post-editing to refine NMT output and enforce terminology adherence.

Result: Evaluation on English-to-German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian using WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus shows that context-driven terminology handling by LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement.

Conclusion: LLMs work best for high-quality translation as context-driven mutators rather than generators, highlighting a critical trade-off between terminology enforcement and translation quality.

Abstract: This paper introduces DuTerm, a novel two-stage architecture for terminology-constrained machine translation. Our system combines a terminology-aware NMT model, adapted via fine-tuning on large-scale synthetic data, with a prompt-based LLM for post-editing. The LLM stage refines NMT output and enforces terminology adherence. We evaluate DuTerm on English-to German, English-to-Spanish, and English-to-Russian with the WMT 2025 Terminology Shared Task corpus. We demonstrate that flexible, context-driven terminology handling by the LLM consistently yields higher quality translations than strict constraint enforcement. Our results highlight a critical trade-off, revealing that an LLM's work best for high-quality translation as context-driven mutators rather than generators.

Conclusion: Thoughtful architectural scaling combined with optimized training design can achieve competitive language model performance without requiring massive parameter counts, advancing the efficiency frontier of large language models.

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B, a new open-weight foundation model that pushes the efficiency frontier of large language models by combining architectural innovation with system-level optimization. Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways.

The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of multi-head self-attention (MHA) in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs, as this area remains underexplored despite MHA's critical importance in other domains.

Method: Proposed Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS) - an efficient method using single forward/backward pass to identify attention head importance for multilingual capabilities. Also introduced lightweight adaptation with soft head mask to modulate attention outputs.

Result: Applied to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, revealed existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer and mitigate off-target language generation. Lightweight adaptation improved XQuAD accuracy with only 20 tunable parameters.

Conclusion: The work enhances both interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of multi-head self-attention, providing insights into attention mechanisms for multilingual processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support multilingual understanding and generation. Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents optimization methods for LLM-based pairwise reranking in RAG systems, achieving 166x latency reduction (from 61.36s to 0.37s per query) with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational inefficiency and high latency of LLM-based pairwise reranking methods, which hinder their real-time deployment in RAG systems despite their effectiveness.

Method: The method involves several optimization techniques: using smaller LLMs, limiting the reranked document set, employing lower precision computation, reducing positional bias through one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens.

Result: The optimizations achieved a 166x latency reduction from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with only insignificant performance degradation in Recall@k metrics.

Conclusion: Carefully applied optimization methods can make LLM-based pairwise reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive real-world applications, highlighting the importance of previously overlooked design choices.

Abstract: Efficiently reranking documents retrieved from information retrieval (IR) pipelines to enhance overall quality of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system remains an important yet challenging problem. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments.

TL;DR: Dutch-specific LLMs underperformed traditional lexicon-based tools (LIWC and Pattern) for valence prediction in Flemish, challenging assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Dutch-tuned Large Language Models can outperform traditional lexicon-based tools in understanding emotional nuances in everyday Flemish language, a low-resource variant.

Method: Compared three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern using 25,000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch speakers with self-assessed valence ratings.

Result: Dutch-tuned LLMs underperformed traditional methods, with Pattern showing superior performance in valence prediction despite LLMs' architectural advancements.

Conclusion: Current LLM fine-tuning approaches may not adequately capture nuanced emotional expressions in everyday language, highlighting the need for culturally and linguistically tailored evaluation frameworks for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Understanding emotional nuances in everyday language is crucial for computational linguistics and emotion research. While traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have served as foundational instruments, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise enhanced context understanding. We evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50). Surprisingly, despite architectural advancements, the Dutch-tuned LLMs underperformed compared to traditional methods, with Pattern showing superior performance. These findings challenge assumptions about LLM superiority in sentiment analysis tasks and highlight the complexity of capturing emotional valence in spontaneous, real-world narratives. Our results underscore the need for developing culturally and linguistically tailored evaluation frameworks for low-resource language variants, while questioning whether current LLM fine-tuning approaches adequately address the nuanced emotional expressions found in everyday language use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods are problematic - lexical metrics lack semantic understanding while LLM-as-Judge approaches are computationally expensive. The paper aims to re-evaluate lightweight NLI-based alternatives.

Method: Used off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference scoring augmented with a simple lexical-match flag, and introduced DIVER-QA - a 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs.

Result: NLI-based evaluation achieved 89.9% accuracy on long-form QA, matching GPT-4o's performance while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters and computational resources.

Conclusion: Inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive with state-of-the-art methods and offers a practical alternative for LLM answer evaluation, with DIVER-QA provided as an open resource for future metric research.

Abstract: Evaluating answers from state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) is challenging: lexical metrics miss semantic nuances, whereas "LLM-as-Judge" scoring is computationally expensive. We re-evaluate a lightweight alternative -- off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) scoring augmented by a simple lexical-match flag and find that this decades-old technique matches GPT-4o's accuracy (89.9%) on long-form QA, while requiring orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters. To test human alignment of these metrics rigorously, we introduce DIVER-QA, a new 3000-sample human-annotated benchmark spanning five QA datasets and five candidate LLMs. Our results highlight that inexpensive NLI-based evaluation remains competitive and offer DIVER-QA as an open resource for future metric research.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates the reliability of six reference-free factuality metrics for long-document summarization, revealing their inconsistencies with semantically equivalent summaries and declining performance for information-dense claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Factual consistency evaluation for abstractive text summarization is challenging for long documents, as conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies.

Method: Systematically evaluated six reference-free factuality metrics through seven factuality-preserving perturbations (paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, source text insertion) and analyzed sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density across three long-form benchmark datasets.

Result: Existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims. Expanding retrieval context improves stability in some domains, but no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights directions for improving factuality evaluation including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

Abstract: Evaluating the factual consistency of abstractive text summarization remains a significant challenge, particularly for long documents, where conventional metrics struggle with input length limitations and long-range dependencies. In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization. We release all code, perturbed data, and scripts required to reproduce our results at https://github.com/zainmujahid/metricEval-longSum.

*Rhitabrat Pokharel,Yufei Tao,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPO is a new preference optimization method that improves multilingual LLM alignment by dynamically scaling loss based on confidence in preference pairs, outperforming DPO by 16% in reward accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing preference optimization methods like DPO work well for English but fail to generalize to multilingual settings due to noisy or low-margin comparisons in multilingual text.

Method: CAPO replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on relative reward, modulating learning signal according to confidence in each preference pair.

Result: CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

Conclusion: CAPO provides a simple yet effective alternative to DPO that enhances robustness to noisy multilingual preference data through confidence-aware dynamic loss scaling.

Abstract: Preference optimization is a critical post-training technique used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, typically by fine-tuning on ranked response pairs. While methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have proven effective in English, they often fail to generalize robustly to multilingual settings. We propose a simple yet effective alternative, Confidence-Aware Preference Optimization (CAPO), which replaces DPO's fixed treatment of preference pairs with a dynamic loss scaling mechanism based on a relative reward. By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text. Empirically, CAPO outperforms existing preference optimization baselines by at least 16% in reward accuracy, and improves alignment by widening the gap between preferred and dispreferred responses across languages.

*Peiqi Sui,Eamon Duede,Hoyt Long,Richard Jean So*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'critical confabulation' - using LLM hallucinations to fill gaps in historical archives caused by social inequality, and evaluates LLMs' ability to generate evidence-bound narratives for overlooked historical figures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address omissions in historical archives due to social and political inequality by leveraging LLM hallucinations in a controlled way to reconstruct narratives for 'hidden figures' in history.

Method: Used an open-ended narrative cloze task where LLMs generate masked events in character-centric timelines from unpublished texts, evaluating audited open models (OLMo-2 family) and baselines with various prompts designed for controlled hallucinations.

Result: Validated LLMs' foundational narrative understanding capabilities for critical confabulation, showing that controlled hallucinations can support knowledge production while maintaining historical accuracy and fidelity.

Conclusion: Well-specified and controlled LLM hallucinations can be productively used for knowledge production, bridging archival gaps without compromising historical accuracy when properly bounded.

Abstract: LLMs hallucinate, yet some confabulations can have social affordances if carefully bounded. We propose critical confabulation (inspired by critical fabulation from literary and social theory), the use of LLM hallucinations to "fill-in-the-gap" for omissions in archives due to social and political inequality, and reconstruct divergent yet evidence-bound narratives for history's "hidden figures". We simulate these gaps with an open-ended narrative cloze task: asking LLMs to generate a masked event in a character-centric timeline sourced from a novel corpus of unpublished texts. We evaluate audited (for data contamination), fully-open models (the OLMo-2 family) and unaudited open-weight and proprietary baselines under a range of prompts designed to elicit controlled and useful hallucinations. Our findings validate LLMs' foundational narrative understanding capabilities to perform critical confabulation, and show how controlled and well-specified hallucinations can support LLM applications for knowledge production without collapsing speculation into a lack of historical accuracy and fidelity.

### [128] [Back to the Future: The Role of Past and Future Context Predictability in Incremental Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07752)
*Shiva Upadhye,Richard Futrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how contextual predictability from both past and future contexts affects word choice and production in natural speech, introducing a new information-theoretic measure and analyzing word duration and substitution errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the poorly-understood backward predictability effect (predictability given future context) in naturalistic language production, which may relate to future planning processes.

Method: Two studies using naturalistic speech corpora with improved measures and powerful language models, introducing a new information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates both future and past context predictability. Study 1 examines word duration effects, while Study 2 analyzes substitution errors within a generative framework.

Result: The proposed alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Fine-grained analysis of substitution errors reveals how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in word encoding and choice, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and sentence planning mechanisms.

Abstract: Contextual predictability shapes both the form and choice of words in online language production. The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.

*Hua Zhou,Bing Ma,Yufei Zhang,Yi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CUFEInse v1.0 is a comprehensive insurance domain benchmark covering 5 dimensions with 54 sub-indicators and 14,430 questions, evaluating 11 LLMs to identify bottlenecks in actuarial capabilities, compliance adaptation, and business scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field and provide academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool for large language models in vertical domains.

Method: Established an evaluation framework based on "quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation" principles, covering insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor across 5 core dimensions with 54 sub-indicators.

Result: Evaluation of 11 mainstream LLMs revealed general-purpose models have weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation, while domain-specific models show advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but lack business adaptation and compliance. Identified bottlenecks in insurance actuarial, underwriting, claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing.

Conclusion: CUFEInse provides an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection, with its methodology offering important references for vertical field evaluation paradigms. Future directions include benchmark iteration and "domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement" for insurance large models.

Abstract: This paper comprehensively elaborates on the construction methodology, multi-dimensional evaluation system, and underlying design philosophy of CUFEInse v1.0. Adhering to the principles of "quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation," the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection. Finally, the paper looks forward to the future iteration direction of the evaluation benchmark and the core development direction of "domain adaptation + reasoning enhancement" for insurance large models.

*Siyu Xia,Zekun Xu,Jiajun Chai,Wentian Fan,Yan Song,Xiaohan Wang,Guojun Yin,Wei Lin,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a trainable graph memory framework for LLM agents that structures agent experiences into decision paths and meta-cognitive strategies, which are optimized via reinforcement learning and integrated through meta-cognitive prompting to enhance reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents acquire experience either through implicit training memory (which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability) or explicit prompting memory (which lacks adaptability), creating a need for a more effective memory framework.

Method: Proposes a multi-layered graph memory that abstracts agent trajectories into structured decision paths, distills them into interpretable meta-cognitive strategies, uses reinforcement-based weight optimization to estimate strategy utility, and integrates optimized strategies through meta-cognitive prompting.

Result: The learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning training.

Conclusion: The proposed trainable graph memory framework effectively enhances LLM agents' ability to utilize parametric information and improves their reasoning capabilities through structured experience representation and adaptive strategy integration.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomous task-solving across complex, open-ended environments. A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AlignSurvey is the first benchmark to systematically evaluate LLMs across the full social survey pipeline, addressing limitations of traditional surveys and existing LLM approaches through four key tasks and comprehensive evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveys face challenges like fixed formats, high costs, and cross-cultural issues, while current LLM approaches are limited to structured questions and risk under-representing marginalized groups due to training biases.

Method: Introduces AlignSurvey benchmark with four tasks aligned with survey stages, multi-tiered dataset architecture (Social Foundation Corpus and Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets), and SurveyLM family models via two-stage fine-tuning.

Result: Provides comprehensive evaluation framework with task-specific metrics for alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at individual/group levels, focusing on demographic diversity across cross-cultural contexts.

Conclusion: AlignSurvey enables transparent and socially responsible research by providing datasets, models, and tools to systematically evaluate LLM performance in replicating social survey processes while addressing representation and fairness concerns.

Abstract: Understanding human attitudes, preferences, and behaviors through social surveys is essential for academic research and policymaking. Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment. All datasets, models, and tools are available at github and huggingface to support transparent and socially responsible research.

*Neelesh Kumar Shukla,Pranay Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A system for forecasting social unrest events in democracies by analyzing news articles using topic modeling, word2vec, NER, and time normalization to identify related entities and predict planned protests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help administrative officials in democracies like India take necessary action by forecasting disruptive civil unrest events (protests, rallies, marches) that are often announced in advance in news articles.

Method: Uses topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities (people, organizations, locations, dates), time normalization for standard date formatting, and proposes Related Entity Extraction to identify entities actually involved in events.

Result: Developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events and extract Related Entities from news announcements.

Conclusion: The system successfully forecasts planned social unrest events by analyzing news announcements through advanced NLP techniques, enabling proactive administrative response to potential civil disruptions.

Abstract: In democracies like India, people are free to express their views and demands. Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events. There could be many mentions of entities, but only a few may actually be involved in the event. This paper calls such entities Related Entities and proposes a method to extract them, referred to as Related Entity Extraction.

### [133] [Breaking the Adversarial Robustness-Performance Trade-off in Text Classification via Manifold Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07888)
*Chenhao Dang,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MC^2F is a novel approach that enhances adversarial robustness in text classification without compromising clean data performance by modeling clean data distribution in the embedding manifold and correcting adversarial embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent challenge where improving model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data in text classification tasks.

Method: Propose a two-module system: 1) Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of clean data manifold, and 2) Geodesic Purification Solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via shortest path.

Result: Extensive evaluations on three text classification datasets show MC^2F establishes new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness while fully preserving clean data performance, with modest accuracy gains.

Conclusion: MC^2F successfully resolves the robustness-clean performance trade-off by operating directly on sentence embeddings through manifold learning and correction, achieving both superior adversarial defense and maintained clean data accuracy.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in text classification (TC) is that enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks typically degrades performance on clean data. We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks. The results demonstrate that our method, MC^2F, not only establishes a new state-of-the-art in adversarial robustness but also fully preserves performance on clean data, even yielding modest gains in accuracy.

*Songze Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Zhaoyan Gong,Xiaoke Guo,Zhengke Gui,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Logits-to-Logic framework to address Logic Drift in LLMs for structured knowledge reasoning tasks like KGQA, using logits strengthening and filtering to improve logic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning due to representational differences between unstructured text and structured knowledge, leading to Logic Drift challenges that existing prompt-based methods cannot fundamentally solve.

Method: Proposed Logits-to-Logic framework that targets the logits output from LLM's autoregressive generation process, incorporating logits strengthening and logits filtering modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvement in LLMs' logic consistency for structured knowledge reasoning and state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Logits-to-Logic framework effectively enhances LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning by directly manipulating logits during generation, outperforming existing methods that only provide input-level guidance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve excellent performance in natural language reasoning tasks through pre-training on vast unstructured text, enabling them to understand the logic in natural language and generate logic-consistent responses. However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how social media data can be used to study mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts through linguistic, visual, and emotional indicators in user posts, aiming to improve medical practice and policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media provides a unique platform where people can discuss stigmatized mental health issues anonymously, creating valuable data sources for research that can help raise awareness and provide timely support.

Method: The study categorizes social media data and employs machine learning, feature engineering, natural language processing techniques to analyze linguistic, visual, and emotional indicators in user disclosures.

We study the state-of-the-art research methodologies and findings on mental health challenges like de- pression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, from the pervasive use of social media data. We also discuss how these novel thinking and approaches can help to raise awareness of mental health issues in an unprecedented way. Specifically, this chapter describes linguistic, visual, and emotional indicators expressed in user disclosures. The main goal of this chapter is to show how this new source of data can be tapped to improve medical practice, provide timely support, and influence government or policymakers. In the context of social media for mental health issues, this chapter categorizes social media data used, introduces different deployed machine learning, feature engineering, natural language processing, and surveys methods and outlines directions for future research.

### [136] [Distinct Theta Synchrony across Speech Modes: Perceived, Spoken, Whispered, and Imagined](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07918)
*Jung-Sun Lee,Ha-Na Jo,Eunyeong Ko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares theta-band neural synchrony across four speech modes (perceived, overt, whispered, imagined) and finds distinct synchronization patterns: overt/whispered speech show broad frontotemporal synchrony, perceived speech shows posterior-temporal patterns, while imagined speech has confined frontal-motor synchrony.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research has focused on single speech modes, lacking integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes to understand distinct neural mechanisms in language processing.

Method: Analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes using connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations in brain activity patterns.

Result: Overt and whispered speech exhibited broader frontotemporal synchrony (motor-phonological coupling), perceived speech showed posterior-temporal patterns (auditory processing), and imagined speech demonstrated confined frontal-motor synchronization.

Conclusion: Theta synchrony extent and spatial distribution differ substantially across speech modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying on temporoparietal networks.

Abstract: Human speech production encompasses multiple modes such as perceived, overt, whispered, and imagined, each reflecting distinct neural mechanisms. Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech.

TL;DR: WorkBench is a unified evaluation suite for work-related NLP tasks, showing cross-task transfer benefits. UWE model achieves superior zero-shot ranking performance over generalist embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Workforce transformation creates demand for specialized NLP, but work tasks have complex characteristics like long-tailed distributions and scarce data. Generalist models' performance in work domain is unclear.

Method: Created WorkBench benchmark with 6 work-related ranking tasks. Developed UWE bi-encoder using bipartite graphs from real data enriched synthetically, with many-to-many InfoNCE objective and token-level embeddings with soft late interaction.

Result: UWE shows significant gains over generalist models in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10, enables zero-shot ranking on unseen target spaces, and supports low-latency inference through cached embeddings.

Conclusion: UWE effectively addresses work domain challenges through unified training approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to generalist embedding models.

Abstract: Workforce transformation across diverse industries has driven an increased demand for specialized natural language processing capabilities. Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction. UWE demonstrates zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces in the work domain, enables low-latency inference by caching the task target space embeddings, and shows significant gains in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10 over generalist embedding models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOTAM-Evolve is a self-evolving framework that enables LLMs to master complex NOTAM interpretation through dual-reasoning (dynamic knowledge grounding and schema-based inference), achieving 30.4% accuracy improvement over base LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated NOTAM interpretation systems are limited to shallow parsing and fail to extract actionable intelligence needed for operational aviation decisions due to the condensed and cryptic nature of NOTAM language.

Method: Proposed NOTAM-Evolve framework with knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval for data grounding, and a closed-loop learning process where LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing need for human-annotated reasoning traces.

Result: Achieved 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over base LLM, establishing new state of the art on structured NOTAM interpretation using a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the dual-reasoning challenge of NOTAM interpretation through autonomous learning and knowledge grounding, significantly advancing automated aviation safety systems.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.

*Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Peter Rupnik,Ivan Porupski,Vuk Dinić,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show strong zero-shot performance on South Slavic language text classification, matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT models, but have drawbacks like unpredictable outputs, slow inference, and high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM performance on text classification for less-resourced South Slavic languages and compare with fine-tuned BERT models, as this area remains under-explored despite the shift toward LLM prompting.

Method: Compared openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with open-source and closed-source LLMs across three text classification tasks: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news/articles, and genre identification in web texts for South Slavic languages.

Result: LLMs demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT models, and performed comparably in South Slavic languages and English when used in zero-shot setup.

Conclusion: While LLMs show competitive performance, fine-tuned BERT models remain more practical for large-scale automatic text annotation due to LLMs' unpredictable outputs, slow inference, and high computational costs.

Abstract: Until recently, fine-tuned BERT-like models provided state-of-the-art performance on text classification tasks. With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-correction distillation (SCD) method to improve structured data question answering for small-scale LLMs by transferring query-generation and error-correction capabilities from large-scale LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale LLMs face challenges in structured data QA due to errors in generating structured queries, while existing unified frameworks like TrustUQA work better with large-scale LLMs.

Method: Self-correction distillation (SCD) with error prompt mechanism (EPM) to detect errors and provide customized messages, plus a two-stage distillation strategy to transfer capabilities from large to small LLMs.

Result: SCD achieves best performance on 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types using 8B models, closely approaching GPT4 performance on some datasets. EPM also helps large LLMs surpass state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: The proposed SCD method effectively enhances structured data QA capabilities of small-scale LLMs and demonstrates superior generalization compared to other distillation approaches.

Abstract: Structured data question answering (QA), including table QA, Knowledge Graph (KG) QA, and temporal KG QA, is a pivotal research area. Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets. Furthermore, large-scale LLMs equipped with EPM surpass the state-of-the-art results on most datasets.

*Shihao Yang,Zhicong Lu,Yong Yang,Bo Lv,Yang Shen,Nayu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyCoRA is a hyper-contrastive role-adaptive learning framework that improves multi-character role-playing by balancing distinct and shared traits through a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure with role-specific and role-shared modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either use shared parameterized modules that ignore distinct role traits or role-specific modules that overlook shared traits, leading to weakened personality learning and hindered commonality modeling.

Method: Proposes a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure with a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network and a trainable role-shared module, plus a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to distinguish unique role characteristics.

Result: Extensive experiments on English and Chinese benchmarks demonstrate superiority, with GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses verifying the capability to capture role characteristics.

Conclusion: HyCoRA effectively balances distinct and shared trait learning for multi-character role-playing, outperforming existing approaches through its novel adaptive framework.

Abstract: Multi-character role-playing aims to equip models with the capability to simulate diverse roles. Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Further GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses also verify the capability of HyCoRA to capture role characteristics.

### [142] [BARD10: A New Benchmark Reveals Significance of Bangla Stop-Words in Authorship Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08085)
*Abdullah Muhammad Moosa,Nusrat Sultana,Mahdi Muhammad Moosa,Md. Miraiz Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BARD10, a new balanced Bangla authorship attribution corpus, and analyzes stop-word impact across classical and deep learning models, finding that classical TF-IDF + SVM outperforms transformers and that Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for better Bangla authorship attribution benchmarks and systematically investigate the stylistic significance of Bangla stop-words across different models and genres.

Method: Created BARD10 corpus from 10 contemporary authors' blog/opinion prose, evaluated four classifiers (SVM, Bangla BERT, XGBoost, MLP) with uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and BAAD16 datasets, analyzing stop-word removal impact.

Result: TF-IDF + SVM achieved best performance (0.997 macro-F1 on BAAD16, 0.921 on BARD10), outperforming Bangla BERT by up to 5 points. BARD10 authors were highly sensitive to stop-word pruning while BAAD16 authors remained robust, showing genre-dependent stop-word reliance.

Conclusion: Bangla stop-words are essential stylistic indicators; classical ML models work well for short texts; BARD10 bridges formal literature with web dialogue and provides reproducible benchmark for future transformer research.

Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive investigation into Bangla authorship attribution, introducing a new balanced benchmark corpus BARD10 (Bangla Authorship Recognition Dataset of 10 authors) and systematically analyzing the impact of stop-word removal across classical and deep learning models to uncover the stylistic significance of Bangla stop-words. BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers.

### [143] [Estranged Predictions: Measuring Semantic Category Disruption with Masked Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08109)
*Yuxuan Liu,Haim Dubossarsky,Ruth Ahnert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses masked language modeling to quantify how science fiction destabilizes ontological categories (human, animal, machine) through measurable conceptual permeability, showing SF has higher category boundary disruption than general fiction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To computationally measure Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement in science fiction by examining how the genre destabilizes ontological categories through semantic deviations detectable via language models.

Method: Used RoBERTa for masked language modeling on science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM) corpora, generating lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. Quantified conceptual slippage through retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy metrics.

Result: Science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, especially around machine referents which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms maintain semantic coherence and anchor substitutional hierarchies, suggesting genre-specific restructuring of anthropocentric logics.

Conclusion: Estrangement in science fiction operates as controlled perturbation of semantic norms detectable through probabilistic modeling. MLMs serve as interpretive instruments for surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions, contributing to computational literary studies methodology.

Abstract: This paper examines how science fiction destabilises ontological categories by measuring conceptual permeability across the terms human, animal, and machine using masked language modelling (MLM). Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions. This study contributes to the methodological repertoire of computational literary studies and offers new insights into the linguistic infrastructure of science fiction.

### [144] [Multimodal LLMs Do Not Compose Skills Optimally Across Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08113)
*Paula Ontalvilla,Aitor Ormazabal,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with cross-modality skill composition despite various improvement attempts, showing significant gaps that require further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well Multimodal Large Language Models can compose previously learned skills across different modalities to solve new tasks.

Method: Designed three evaluation tasks requiring sequential composition of two modality-dependent skills, evaluated open MLLMs using direct prompting and two-step cascaded inference, and explored chain-of-thought prompting and fine-tuning to improve composition.

Result: All evaluated MLLMs showed significant cross-modality skill composition gaps. Chain-of-thought prompting and fine-tuning improved performance but still left substantial composition gaps.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have notable limitations in cross-modal skill composition, and more research is needed to address this fundamental capability gap.

Abstract: Skill composition is the ability to combine previously learned skills to solve new tasks. As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs.

*Raquel Montero,Natalia Moskvina,Paolo Morosi,Tamara Serrano,Elena Pagliarini,Evelina Leivada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates three key features of human quantification that are unexplored in MLLM literature: quantifier ordering scales, usage ranges/prototypicality, and human number system biases. It examines how these features differ between humans and MLLMs across different models and languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantification is difficult for MLLMs, but the exact reasons are unclear since it interfaces with logic, pragmatics, and numerical domains. The paper aims to understand how human quantification features are encoded in MLLMs and how they differ from human cognition.

Method: The study examines three cross-linguistic human quantification features: quantifier ordering scales, usage ranges/prototypicality, and human approximate number system biases. It analyzes how these features are represented in MLLM architectures across different models and languages.

Result: Clear differences were found between humans and MLLMs regarding these quantification features across various tasks, revealing distinctions in how quantification is represented in vivo (humans) vs. in silico (MLLMs).

Conclusion: This work paves the way for understanding MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic approach helps determine whether their quantification abilities are robust and stable across different languages.

Abstract: Quantification has been proven to be a particularly difficult linguistic phenomenon for (Multimodal) Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, given that quantification interfaces with the logic, pragmatic, and numerical domains, the exact reasons for the poor performance are still unclear. This papers looks at three key features of human quantification shared cross-linguistically that have remained so far unexplored in the (M)LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and the biases inherent in the human approximate number system. The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico. This work, thus, paves the way for addressing the nature of MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic lens can elucidate whether their abilities are robust and stable across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the memory and computational demands of processing long sequences in Large Language Models by compressing context.

Method: Fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to compress their context using learned compression tokens.

Result: Achieved 2x-8x compression ratios without significant performance degradation on both short-context and long-context benchmarks. On a 3-billion-parameter LLaMA model, results were comparable to alternative compression techniques with higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: Learned compression tokens enable effective context compression for LLMs, reducing computational demands while maintaining performance.

Abstract: This work investigates context compression for Large Language Models (LLMs) using learned compression tokens to reduce the memory and computational demands of processing long sequences. We demonstrate that pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned to compress their context by factors of 2x to 8x without significant performance degradation, as evaluated on both short-context and long-context benchmarks. Furthermore, in experiments on a 3-billion-parameter LLaMA model, our method achieves results on par with alternative compression techniques while attaining higher compression ratios.

*Kushal Tatariya,Wessel Poelman,Miryam de Lhoneux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether English-biased language model architectures, specifically positional encodings, perform worse for structurally different languages. It tests the trade-off hypothesis between morphological complexity and word order flexibility using monolingual models with different positional encodings across seven diverse languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if architectural bias in language models (originally designed for English) degrades performance for structurally different languages, focusing on positional encodings and the trade-off between morphological complexity and word order flexibility.

Method: Pretrained monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages, evaluated on four downstream tasks.

Result: Contrary to previous findings, no clear interaction was observed between positional encodings and morphological complexity or word order flexibility. Results show that task choice, language selection, and metrics are crucial for stable conclusions.

Conclusion: The study found no evidence supporting the trade-off hypothesis in relation to positional encodings, emphasizing the importance of methodological choices (tasks, languages, metrics) in drawing reliable conclusions about architectural biases in language models.

Abstract: Language model architectures are predominantly first created for English and subsequently applied to other languages. It is an open question whether this architectural bias leads to degraded performance for languages that are structurally different from English. We examine one specific architectural choice: positional encodings, through the lens of the trade-off hypothesis: the supposed interplay between morphological complexity and word order flexibility. This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks. Contrary to previous findings, we do not observe a clear interaction between position encodings and morphological complexity or word order flexibility, as measured by various proxies. Our results show that the choice of tasks, languages, and metrics are essential for drawing stable conclusions

### [148] [Relation as a Prior: A Novel Paradigm for LLM-based Document-level Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08143)
*Qiankun Pi,Yepeng Sun,Jicang Lu,Qinlong Fan,Ningbo Huang,Shiyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RelPrior is a new paradigm for document-level relation extraction using LLMs that uses relation as a prior to filter irrelevant entity pairs and extract triples, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods for document-level relation extraction suffer from noise from unrelated entity pairs and misjudgment when entities have semantic associations but don't match predefined relation labels.

Method: The RelPrior paradigm uses binary relation as a prior to filter irrelevant entity pairs, then uses predefined relations as a prior to match entities for triple extraction instead of directly predicting relations.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

Conclusion: The RelPrior paradigm effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based document relation extraction by using relation as a prior for filtering and matching, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in document understanding. However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted "extract entities then predict relations" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods.

TL;DR: Instruction-tuned LLMs underperform specialized ByT5-Sanskrit models for Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion, demonstrating that LLMs are not universally superior for low-resource, morphologically rich languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs can serve as universal solutions for NLP tasks in low-resource, morphologically rich languages like Sanskrit, using poetry-to-prose conversion as a challenging test case.

Method: Compared instruction-tuned LLMs and in-context prompting with specialized ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq models on Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion, incorporating Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperformed all LLM approaches, with human evaluation strongly supporting these findings and showing high correlation with automated metrics.

Conclusion: Specialized task-specific models remain superior to general-purpose LLMs for complex NLP tasks in low-resource languages, though LLM prompting provides a viable alternative when domain-specific data is unavailable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly treated as universal, general-purpose solutions across NLP tasks, particularly in English. But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores. Additionally, our prompting strategies provide an alternative to fine-tuning when domain-specific verse corpora are unavailable, and the task-specific Seq2Seq model demonstrates robust generalisation on out-of-domain evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of syntactic properties in BabyLM corpus and CHILDES age-groups shows limited age-based syntactic differentiation in CHILDES, but syntactic knowledge aids model performance interpretation. Curriculum learning experiments reveal that some curricula help with reading tasks, with main improvements coming from using syntactically categorizable data subsets rather than full noisy corpus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand syntactic properties in child language data (BabyLM corpus and CHILDES) and investigate how syntactic knowledge can inform model performance interpretation and curriculum learning approaches.

Method: Examined syntactic properties of BabyLM corpus and CHILDES age-groups, explored developmental and cognitively inspired curriculum approaches for curriculum learning.

Result: CHILDES shows weak syntactic differentiation by age; syntactic knowledge helps interpret model performance on linguistic tasks; some curricula improve reading tasks; main performance gains come from using syntactically categorizable data subsets.

Conclusion: Syntactic knowledge of training data is valuable for interpreting model performance, and curriculum learning benefits more from using clean, syntactically categorizable data subsets than from full noisy corpora.

Abstract: We examine the syntactic properties of BabyLM corpus, and age-groups within CHILDES. While we find that CHILDES does not exhibit strong syntactic differentiation by age, we show that the syntactic knowledge about the training data can be helpful in interpreting model performance on linguistic tasks. For curriculum learning, we explore developmental and several alternative cognitively inspired curriculum approaches. We find that some curricula help with reading tasks, but the main performance improvement come from using the subset of syntactically categorizable data, rather than the full noisy corpus.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate extraction of key entities and contextual information from rapidly expanding astronomy literature to handle the growing volume of scientific papers.

Method: Multi-task transformer-based system built on SciBERT, fine-tuned for astronomy corpora classification using stochastic sampling from training data and majority voting at inference.

Result: The system significantly outperforms open-weight GPT baseline despite its simplicity and low-cost implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed encoder-based approach provides an effective and efficient solution for knowledge extraction from astronomy articles, demonstrating superior performance over existing baselines.

Abstract: Scientific literature in astronomy is rapidly expanding, making it increasingly important to automate the extraction of key entities and contextual information from research papers. In this paper, we present an encoder-based system for extracting knowledge from astronomy articles. Our objective is to develop models capable of classifying telescope references, detecting auxiliary semantic attributes, and recognizing instrument mentions from textual content. To this end, we implement a multi-task transformer-based system built upon the SciBERT model and fine-tuned for astronomy corpora classification. To carry out the fine-tuning, we stochastically sample segments from the training data and use majority voting over the test segments at inference time. Our system, despite its simplicity and low-cost implementation, significantly outperforms the open-weight GPT baseline.

TL;DR: This paper presents an embedding-based framework to detect gender bias in LLMs for educational feedback, using controlled counterfactuals on student essays and finding asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions across six models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As teachers increasingly use GenAI in education, there's a need for robust benchmarking methods to detect bias in LLMs for pedagogical purposes, particularly in formative feedback contexts.

Method: Used 600 authentic student essays with controlled counterfactuals along implicit (lexicon-based gendered term swaps) and explicit (gendered author background) dimensions. Analyzed six LLMs using embedding-based divergence metrics, permutation tests, and dimensionality reduction visualization.

Result: All models showed larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than female-male. Only GPT and Llama models were sensitive to explicit gender cues. Qualitative analysis revealed linguistic differences in feedback style based on gender cues.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art LLMs exhibit persistent gender biases in feedback, with asymmetric responses to gender substitutions. The study provides implications for fairness auditing, reporting standards, and practical guidance for equitable feedback deployment.

Abstract: As teachers increasingly turn to GenAI in their educational practice, we need robust methods to benchmark large language models (LLMs) for pedagogical purposes. This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParliaBench is a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation that addresses the unique challenges of political authenticity and ideological consistency. It includes a dataset from UK Parliament, an evaluation framework with computational metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, and novel embedding-based metrics for political alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parliamentary speech generation requires political authenticity and ideological consistency beyond standard linguistic quality, but current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts and existing evaluation methods don't adequately measure political authenticity.

Method: Constructed a dataset of UK Parliament speeches, introduced an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-judge assessments, proposed two novel embedding-based metrics (Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment), and fine-tuned five large language models to generate 28k speeches.

Result: Fine-tuning produced statistically significant improvements across most metrics, and the novel political alignment metrics demonstrated strong discriminative power for assessing political dimensions in generated speeches.

Conclusion: The ParliaBench benchmark effectively addresses the specific challenges of parliamentary speech generation, with fine-tuned models showing improved performance and the novel political metrics proving valuable for evaluating political authenticity and ideological consistency.

Abstract: Parliamentary speech generation presents specific challenges for large language models beyond standard text generation tasks. Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.

Method: Created CHiTab benchmark from PubTables-1M dataset, used prompt engineering strategies with various formats and styles, evaluated multiple state-of-the-art VLLMs both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned, and compared with human performance.

Result: Generic VLLMs not specifically designed for table structure understanding can perform the task, though performance varies across models and approaches.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into VLLMs' potential and limitations for processing complex tables and offers guidance for future integration of structured data understanding into general-purpose VLLMs.

Abstract: This work investigates the ability of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) to understand and interpret the structure of tables in scientific articles. Specifically, we explore whether VLLMs can infer the hierarchical structure of tables without additional processing. As a basis for our experiments we use the PubTables-1M dataset, a large-scale corpus of scientific tables. From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task. This study provides insights into the potential and limitations of VLLMs to process complex tables and offers guidance for future work on integrating structured data understanding into general-purpose VLLMs.

*Shuaimin Li,Liyang Fan,Yufang Lin,Zeyang Li,Xian Wei,Shiwen Ni,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReViewGraph is a novel framework that uses heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated reviewer-author debates to improve paper review quality by capturing complex argumentative dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing paper review methods rely on superficial features or LLMs directly, leading to hallucinations, biased scoring, and limited reasoning capabilities. They fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics in reviewer-author interactions.

Method: Simulates reviewer-author exchanges through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration, extracts diverse opinion relations (acceptance, rejection, clarification, compromise), encodes them as typed edges in a heterogeneous interaction graph, and applies graph neural networks for reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on three datasets show ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%.

Conclusion: Modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures through graph reasoning significantly improves review decision quality and demonstrates the value of capturing fine-grained argumentative dynamics.

Abstract: Existing paper review methods often rely on superficial manuscript features or directly on large language models (LLMs), which are prone to hallucinations, biased scoring, and limited reasoning capabilities. Moreover, these methods often fail to capture the complex argumentative reasoning and negotiation dynamics inherent in reviewer-author interactions. To address these limitations, we propose ReViewGraph (Reviewer-Author Debates Graph Reasoner), a novel framework that performs heterogeneous graph reasoning over LLM-simulated multi-round reviewer-author debates. In our approach, reviewer-author exchanges are simulated through LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Diverse opinion relations (e.g., acceptance, rejection, clarification, and compromise) are then explicitly extracted and encoded as typed edges within a heterogeneous interaction graph. By applying graph neural networks to reason over these structured debate graphs, ReViewGraph captures fine-grained argumentative dynamics and enables more informed review decisions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that ReViewGraph outperforms strong baselines with an average relative improvement of 15.73%, underscoring the value of modeling detailed reviewer-author debate structures.

### [158] [Adaptive Multi-Agent Response Refinement in Conversational Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08319)
*Soyeong Jeong,Aparna Elangovan,Emine Yilmaz,Oleg Rokhlenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework for refining LLM responses by assigning specialized agents to improve factuality, personalization, and coherence through dynamic communication rather than fixed sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate responses lacking personalization or specific knowledge, and existing single-LLM refinement methods fail to address multiple conversational aspects effectively.

Method: Multi-agent framework with specialized agents for factuality, personalization, and coherence, using dynamic communication strategy to adaptively select and coordinate agents based on query requirements.

Result: Significantly outperforms relevant baselines on challenging conversational datasets, especially in tasks involving knowledge, user persona, or both.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework with dynamic communication effectively improves conversational quality by addressing multiple aspects simultaneously, demonstrating superior performance over single-agent approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.

### [159] [AgentPRM: Process Reward Models for LLM Agents via Step-Wise Promise and Progress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08325)
*Zhiheng Xi,Chenyang Liao,Guanyu Li,Yajie Yang,Wenxiang Chen,Zhihao Zhang,Binghai Wang,Senjie Jin,Yuhao Zhou,Jian Guan,Wei Wu,Tao Ji,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes AgentPRM, a process reward model for LLM agents that evaluates sequential decisions based on goal proximity and progress, using TD-based estimation for efficient training. It achieves 8x compute efficiency over baselines and scales well with test-time compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-turn decision-making tasks that require sequential intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Existing approaches rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning, but lack proper evaluation of intermediate decisions in agent tasks.

Method: Propose AgentPRM to capture interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to final goals. Use Temporal Difference-based estimation combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation for scalable training data labeling.

Result: AgentPRM achieves over 8x compute efficiency compared to baselines across different agentic tasks. It demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute and can be applied to reinforcement learning of LLM agents.

Conclusion: AgentPRM provides an effective framework for evaluating sequential decisions in agent tasks, enabling better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance while being significantly more compute-efficient than existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite rapid development, large language models (LLMs) still encounter challenges in multi-turn decision-making tasks (i.e., agent tasks) like web shopping and browser navigation, which require making a sequence of intelligent decisions based on environmental feedback. Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.

*Xinyi Wang,Yiping Song,Zhiliang Tian,Bo Liu,Tingjin Luo,Minlie Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPRM is a dual implicit process reward model that trains two separate PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in multi-hop QA tasks, using outcome signals without explicit annotations and introducing consistency constraints between reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing implicit PRMs only work for plain text and cannot handle graph structure constraints in KGs or capture inconsistencies between CoT and KG paths in MHQA tasks.

Method: Train two implicit PRMs (KG-PRM and CoT-PRM) that derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization, use preference pairs to learn KG structural constraints, and introduce consistency constraints between CoT and KG reasoning steps.

Result: Outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

Conclusion: DPRM effectively addresses limitations of existing implicit PRMs by handling graph constraints and ensuring consistency between different reasoning paths, achieving superior performance in MHQA tasks.

Abstract: In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often lack logical coherence and don't follow explicit inference rules, raising trustworthiness concerns in their reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes Proof-Carrying Reasoning with LLMs (PCRLLM) that constrains reasoning to single-step inferences with explicit specification of premises, rules, and conclusions, and introduces a benchmark schema for generating step-level reasoning data.

Result: The framework enables verification against target logic, supports chain-level validation in black-box settings, and facilitates systematic multi-LLM collaboration by allowing comparison and integration of intermediate steps.

Conclusion: PCRLLM combines natural language expressiveness with formal rigor, addressing trustworthiness concerns in LLM reasoning while enabling verifiable and collaborative reasoning processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit limited logical coherence, mapping premises to conclusions without adherence to explicit inference rules. We propose Proof-Carrying Reasoning with LLMs (PCRLLM), a framework that constrains reasoning to single-step inferences while preserving natural language formulations. Each output explicitly specifies premises, rules, and conclusions, thereby enabling verification against a target logic. This mechanism mitigates trustworthiness concerns by supporting chain-level validation even in black-box settings. Moreover, PCRLLM facilitates systematic multi-LLM collaboration, allowing intermediate steps to be compared and integrated under formal rules. Finally, we introduce a benchmark schema for generating large-scale step-level reasoning data, combining natural language expressiveness with formal rigor.

*Sian Gooding,Edward Grefenstette*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE introduces a novel reward signal based on conversational geometry (embedding trajectory dynamics) that achieves comparable performance to text-based methods and shows complementary benefits when combined with textual analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods focus only on text content, ignoring the rich signal from interaction dynamics and conversational patterns.

Method: Developed TRACE - a trajectory-based reward model that analyzes geometric properties of dialogue embedding trajectories (conversational geometry) without accessing text content.

Result: TRACE achieved 68.20% pairwise accuracy vs 70.04% for text-based baseline; hybrid model combining both achieved 80.17% accuracy, demonstrating complementary benefits.

Conclusion: How agents communicate is as important as what they say; TRACE provides a privacy-preserving framework for agent alignment and understanding successful collaboration patterns.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversations typically relies on reward signals derived from the content of the text. This approach, however, overlooks a rich, complementary source of signal: the dynamics of the interaction itself. This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature. This work provides strong evidence that for interactive settings, how an agent communicates is as powerful a predictor of success as what it says, offering a new, privacy-preserving framework that not only aligns agents but also serves as a diagnostic tool for understanding the distinct interaction patterns that drive successful collaboration.

*Shiyan Zheng,Herun Wan,Minnan Luo,Junhang Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates shortcut learning in social bot detectors, showing they degrade by 32% when exposed to spurious textual correlations, and proposes LLM-based counterfactual augmentation strategies that improve performance by 56%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing social bot detectors perform well on benchmarks but lack robustness in real-world scenarios due to shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations rather than causal features, particularly with manipulable textual features.

Method: Designed shortcut scenarios with spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues, then proposed mitigation strategies using large language models for counterfactual data augmentation across three levels: individual user text, overall dataset distribution, and model's causal information extraction capability.

Result: Shifts in irrelevant feature distributions caused an average 32% relative accuracy drop in baseline social bot detectors. The proposed LLM-based counterfactual augmentation strategies achieved an average 56% relative performance improvement under shortcut scenarios.

Conclusion: Shortcut learning significantly impacts social bot detector robustness, but counterfactual data augmentation using large language models effectively mitigates this problem by addressing data distribution issues and enhancing causal feature extraction.

Abstract: While existing social bot detectors perform well on benchmarks, their robustness across diverse real-world scenarios remains limited due to unclear ground truth and varied misleading cues. In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information. Our strategies achieve an average relative performance improvement of 56\% under shortcut scenarios.

TL;DR: S-RAG is a new approach for aggregative queries that constructs structured corpus representations and translates natural language queries into formal queries, outperforming standard RAG systems and long-context LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems focus on queries where only small parts of corpora are relevant, failing to handle aggregative queries that require gathering and reasoning over information from many documents.

Method: S-RAG constructs structured representations of corpora at ingestion time and translates natural language queries into formal queries over these structured representations at inference time.

Result: S-RAG substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs on newly introduced datasets (HOTELS and WORLD CUP) and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: S-RAG effectively addresses the gap in handling aggregative queries and provides a promising approach for information gathering and reasoning over large document collections.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the dominant approach for answering questions over large corpora. However, current datasets and methods are highly focused on cases where only a small part of the corpus (usually a few paragraphs) is relevant per query, and fail to capture the rich world of aggregative queries. These require gathering information from a large set of documents and reasoning over them. To address this gap, we propose S-RAG, an approach specifically designed for such queries. At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP. Experiments with S-RAG on the newly introduced datasets, as well as on a public benchmark, demonstrate that it substantially outperforms both common RAG systems and long-context LLMs.

Motivation: Bangla Sign Language translation is a low-resource NLP task with limited existing research focused only on word/alphabet level detection, lacking large-scale sentence-level translation datasets.

Method: Created Bangla-SGP dataset with 1,000 manually annotated sentence-gloss pairs by professional signer, augmented with ~3,000 synthetic pairs using syntactic/morphological rules through rule-based RAG pipeline with linguistic strategies and prompt engineering.

Result: Fine-tuned transformer models (mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano) and evaluated sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, comparing gloss-translation consistency across their dataset and RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.

Conclusion: The work addresses the resource gap in BdSL translation by introducing a comprehensive sentence-level dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of transformer models for sign language translation tasks.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) translation represents a low-resource NLP task due to the lack of large-scale datasets that address sentence-level translation. Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in complex but easy-to-verify problems, yet they still struggle with discovering the unknown. In this paper, we present \textbf{AlphaResearch}, an autonomous research agent designed to discover new algorithms on open-ended problems. To synergize the feasibility and innovation of the discovery process, we construct a novel dual research environment by combining the execution-based verify and simulated real-world peer review environment.

To promote a transparent evaluation process, we construct \textbf{AlphaResearchComp}, a new evaluation benchmark that includes an eight open-ended algorithmic problems competition, with each problem carefully curated and verified through executable pipelines, objective metrics, and reproducibility checks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically investigates CoT monitorability - the ability to monitor model misbehavior through chain-of-thought reasoning. It addresses two key challenges: verbalization faithfulness and monitor reliability, providing empirical evidence across multiple domains and proposing a new monitoring paradigm called MoME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Reasoning Models generate detailed reasoning traces that create opportunities for AI safety monitoring, but face challenges with truthful verbalization and reliable detection of misbehavior through CoT analysis.

Method: The study examines verbalization quality and monitor reliability through empirical evidence and correlation analyses across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. It investigates how different CoT intervention methods affect monitoring effectiveness and proposes MoME - a paradigm where LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT with structured judgments and evidence.

Result: The paper provides empirical evidence showing correlations between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across different domains. It demonstrates how CoT interventions impact monitoring effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoT monitorability presents both challenges and opportunities for AI safety. The proposed MoME paradigm offers a structured approach for LLMs to monitor other models' reasoning traces, addressing fundamental issues in verbalization faithfulness and monitor reliability.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.

### [172] [Moral Susceptibility and Robustness under Persona Role-Play in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08565)
*Davi Bastos Costa,Felippe Alves,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to analyze how LLMs' moral judgments change when role-playing different personas, measuring moral susceptibility (variability across personas) and moral robustness (variability within personas).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly operate in social contexts, necessitating understanding of how they express and shift moral judgments, particularly when assuming different character personas.

Method: Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), the authors quantify moral susceptibility and robustness by analyzing MFQ score variability across and within personas during role-play scenarios.

Result: Claude models are most morally robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4; larger models show higher moral susceptibility; robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, especially at family level.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning significantly shapes moral behavior in LLMs, with systematic patterns across model families and sizes, providing insights for responsible AI development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in social contexts, motivating analysis of how they express and shift moral judgments. In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.

### [173] [Think-at-Hard: Selective Latent Iterations to Improve Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08577)
*Tianyu Fu,Yichen You,Zekai Chen,Guohao Dai,Huazhong Yang,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Think-at-Hard (TaH) is a dynamic latent thinking method that selectively applies additional iterations only to hard tokens, avoiding overthinking on easy tokens while improving reasoning performance with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the latent overthinking phenomenon in recurrent transformers where easy tokens that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors during additional iterations.

Method: Uses a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens likely incorrect after standard forward pass, employs LoRA modules for hard-token refinement, and introduces duo-causal attention for cross-iteration information flow while maintaining sequential parallelism.

Result: TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining same parameter count, delivering 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains compared to baselines that iterate twice for all tokens, and exempting 94% of tokens from second iteration.

Conclusion: The proposed TaH method effectively improves reasoning capabilities by dynamically allocating computational resources to hard tokens, achieving significant performance gains with minimal parameter overhead while avoiding the overthinking problem.

Abstract: Improving reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially under parameter constraints, is crucial for real-world applications. Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/TaH.

### [174] [Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08579)
*Belinda Z. Li,Zifan Carl Guo,Vincent Huang,Jacob Steinhardt,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models can be trained to generate natural language explanations of their internal computations, and self-explanation works better than having other models explain them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models can leverage their privileged access to internal computations to produce faithful explanations of their behavior, and whether self-explanation outperforms cross-model explanation.

Method: Fine-tuned language models using existing interpretability techniques as ground truth to generate natural language descriptions of feature information, causal structure of activations, and token influence on outputs.

Result: Explainer models show non-trivial generalization to new queries with only tens of thousands of training examples, and self-explanation generally works better than using different models even if they are more capable.

Conclusion: Language models can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, offering a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs' privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs' internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.

*Jiacheng Wu,Ruiqi Zhang,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DIS is a unified framework for high-fidelity, relightable avatar reconstruction that integrates generative priors into a mesh-based surface representation, achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency and detail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional volumetric approaches are slow due to extensive rendering queries, while surface-based methods are limited by vertex count and lack integration of generative priors for physically based human avatar modeling.

Method: DIS uses a mesh-based model with a normal conversion module that fuses multi-view 2D generative normal predictions into surface offsets via differentiable rasterization, and a de-shading module that refines albedo by removing baked-in shading and back-propagates errors to optimize geometry.

Result: DIS achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality, enhanced rendering efficiency, lower memory consumption, and detailed surface reconstruction through joint optimization of geometry and material appearance.

Conclusion: DIS provides a physically consistent, high-quality reconstruction framework suitable for accurate relighting by effectively integrating generative priors into coherent surface representations.

Abstract: Reconstructing human avatars using generative priors is essential for achieving versatile and realistic avatar models. Traditional approaches often rely on volumetric representations guided by generative models, but these methods require extensive volumetric rendering queries, leading to slow training. Alternatively, surface-based representations offer faster optimization through differentiable rasterization, yet they are typically limited by vertex count, restricting mesh resolution and scalability when combined with generative priors. Moreover, integrating generative priors into physically based human avatar modeling remains largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DIS (Deep Inverse Shading), a unified framework for high-fidelity, relightable avatar reconstruction that incorporates generative priors into a coherent surface representation. DIS centers on a mesh-based model that serves as the target for optimizing both surface and material details. The framework fuses multi-view 2D generative surface normal predictions, rich in detail but often inconsistent, into the central mesh using a normal conversion module. This module converts generative normal outputs into per-triangle surface offsets via differentiable rasterization, enabling the capture of fine geometric details beyond sparse vertex limitations. Additionally, DIS integrates a de-shading module to recover accurate material properties. This module refines albedo predictions by removing baked-in shading and back-propagates reconstruction errors to optimize the geometry. Through joint optimization of geometry and material appearance, DIS achieves physically consistent, high-quality reconstructions suitable for accurate relighting. Our experiments show that DIS delivers SOTA relighting quality, enhanced rendering efficiency, lower memory consumption, and detailed surface reconstruction.

### [176] [Analysing Environmental Efficiency in AI for X-Ray Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07436)
*Liam Kearns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparison of LLMs vs small discriminative models for COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays, showing smaller models reduce carbon footprint but generative models underperform in accuracy and environmental efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To benchmark the performance and environmental impact of using large language models versus smaller custom models for medical diagnosis tasks, specifically COVID-19 detection from chest X-rays.

Method: Integration of 14 different model configurations including LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude) and small discriminative models into a Mendix application, with discriminative models providing knowledge bases to improve LLM accuracy.

Result: Smaller models reduced carbon footprint but showed biased positive diagnosis and low confidence probabilities. GPT-4.1-Nano reduced carbon footprint by 94.2% vs larger models, but Covid-Net achieved 95.5% accuracy with 99.9% less carbon footprint than GPT-4.5-Preview.

Conclusion: Using LLMs for classification tasks poses environmental risks; discriminative models like Covid-Net provide superior accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the limitations of treating LLMs as universal AI solutions.

Abstract: The integration of AI tools into medical applications has aimed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis. The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.

### [178] [Beyond Correctness: Confidence-Aware Reward Modeling for Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07483)
*Qianxi He,Qingyu Ren,Shanzhe Lei,Xuhong Wang,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a confidence-based reward model for enhancing STEM reasoning in LLMs, addressing issues with traditional rule-based RL that often produces poor reasoning chains or inconsistencies, especially in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based RL for LLMs frequently results in low-quality reasoning chains and inconsistencies between reasoning and final answers, particularly with smaller models. This limits resource-limited organizations from conducting effective RL training on smaller-scale models.

Method: Proposes a novel confidence-based reward model that penalizes both incorrect answers and low-confidence correct responses, promoting robust and logically consistent reasoning. Validated through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

Result: The method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. Codes and model are publicly released.

Conclusion: The confidence-based reward model effectively enhances STEM reasoning capabilities in LLMs, particularly addressing limitations of traditional rule-based RL approaches and enabling better training outcomes for smaller-scale models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted the post-training paradigm from traditional instruction tuning and human preference alignment toward reinforcement learning (RL) focused on reasoning capabilities. However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM.

*Vincent Hsiao,Mark Roberts,Leslie Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using hierarchical task networks (HTNs) as procedural knowledge significantly improves LLM performance on agentic tasks, with hand-coded HTNs boosting smaller models to outperform much larger baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with agentic tasks without extensive tool support or fine-tuning, and while domain-dependent procedural knowledge is known to improve planning efficiency, its potential for enhancing LLM performance on agentic tasks requiring implicit planning remains underexplored.

Method: Formalized and implemented an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge through hierarchical task networks (HTNs), evaluating both hand-coded and LLM-created HTNs.

Result: Hand-coded HTNs dramatically improved LLM performance on agentic tasks, enabling 20b and 70b parameter LLMs to outperform a 120b parameter baseline. LLM-created HTNs also improved performance but to a lesser extent.

Conclusion: Leveraging expertise from humans, documents, or LLMs to curate procedural knowledge will become an important tool for improving LLM workflows, demonstrating the significant value of structured procedural knowledge in agentic task performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle when performing agentic tasks without substantial tool support, prom-pt engineering, or fine tuning. Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows.

### [180] [Beyond Fact Retrieval: Episodic Memory for RAG with Generative Semantic Workspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07587)
*Shreyas Rajesh,Pavan Holur,Chenda Duan,David Chong,Vwani Roychowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GSW is a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that enables LLMs to reason over evolving situations by building structured, interpretable representations, outperforming RAG baselines by up to 20% on long-context episodic memory tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM memory solutions are tailored for fact-based retrieval but fail to build narrative representations needed for tracking entities through episodic events, creating a gap in long-context reasoning capabilities.

Method: GSW consists of an Operator that maps observations to semantic structures and a Reconciler that integrates them into a persistent workspace enforcing temporal, spatial, and logical coherence.

Result: On Episodic Memory Benchmark (100k-1M tokens), GSW outperforms RAG baselines by up to 20% and reduces query-time context tokens by 51% compared to the next most token-efficient baseline.

Conclusion: GSW provides a blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, enabling more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in long-context reasoning: many documents exceed their finite context windows, while performance on texts that do fit degrades with sequence length, necessitating their augmentation with external memory frameworks. Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \textbf{20\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \textbf{51\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably. More broadly, GSW offers a concrete blueprint for endowing LLMs with human-like episodic memory, paving the way for more capable agents that can reason over long horizons.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-enhanced framework for assessing individual contributions in teams by analyzing multiple data sources (submissions, communications, coordination records) across three dimensions (Contribution, Interaction, Role) using objective measures and LLM analysis to generate transparent advisory judgments for conflict resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing individual contributions in teams often lead to unfair performance evaluation due to workload disparities and conflicts, requiring manual intervention which is costly and challenging. There's a gap in existing tools regarding conflict resolution methods and AI integration.

Method: The framework organizes heterogeneous artifacts into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalized, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to identify conflict markers. A Large Language Model architecture performs validated and contextual analysis to generate interpretable advisory judgments.

Result: The proposed framework enables systematic analysis of team contributions through multiple data sources and dimensions, using objective metrics and AI-powered analysis to surface conflict markers and provide transparent advisory judgments for dispute resolution.

Conclusion: The paper presents a feasible AI-enhanced tool framework for equitable team contribution assessment that addresses current gaps in conflict resolution, with practical analytics, bias safeguards, and consideration of statutory and institutional policy constraints.

Abstract: The equitable assessment of individual contribution in teams remains a persistent challenge, where conflict and disparity in workload can result in unfair performance evaluation, often requiring manual intervention - a costly and challenging process. We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments. We argue for feasibility under current statutory and institutional policy, and outline practical analytics (sentimental, task fidelity, word/line count, etc.), bias safeguards, limitations, and practical challenges.

TL;DR: A framework for achieving human-AI cognitive partnership in high-stakes strategic decisions through a 7-stage calibration sequence and 5-layer protection architecture to prevent cognitive biases and maintain reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs excel in verifiable domains but prove unreliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes, creating defensibility and sustainability gaps in valuations and investments due to mutually reinforcing cognitive biases.

Method: Systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure, using detailed prompting and a 7-stage calibration sequence within a 5-layer protection architecture for bias monitoring and partnership maintenance.

Result: Partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades with architectural drift and context exhaustion; dissolution discipline prevents costly wrong directions; cross-model validation shows systematic performance differences.

Conclusion: Human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing ROI expectations by supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification is delayed.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel in verifiable domains where outputs can be checked before action but prove less reliable for high-stakes strategic decisions with uncertain outcomes. This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.
  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.
  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.
  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.

Result: Achieves performance equal to human superforecasters on ForecastBench benchmark and outperforms prior LLM baselines. On a more challenging prediction market benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone.

Conclusion: Establishes new state-of-the-art in AI forecasting, provides practical recommendations for future research, and is the first work to verifiably achieve expert-level forecasting at scale.

Abstract: This technical report describes the AIA Forecaster, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system for judgmental forecasting using unstructured data. The AIA Forecaster approach combines three core elements: agentic search over high-quality news sources, a supervisor agent that reconciles disparate forecasts for the same event, and a set of statistical calibration techniques to counter behavioral biases in large language models. On the ForecastBench benchmark (Karger et al., 2024), the AIA Forecaster achieves performance equal to human superforecasters, surpassing prior LLM baselines. In addition to reporting on ForecastBench, we also introduce a more challenging forecasting benchmark sourced from liquid prediction markets. While the AIA Forecaster underperforms market consensus on this benchmark, an ensemble combining AIA Forecaster with market consensus outperforms consensus alone, demonstrating that our forecaster provides additive information. Our work establishes a new state of the art in AI forecasting and provides practical, transferable recommendations for future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ResearchRubrics is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Deep Research (DR) agents, featuring 2,500+ expert-written rubrics across 2,800+ hours of human labor to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity in long-form research responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of Deep Research agents is challenging due to lengthy, diverse responses with many valid solutions and reliance on dynamic information sources, requiring standardized assessment methods.

Method: Created ResearchRubrics benchmark with domain-diverse prompts and fine-grained rubrics, developed complexity framework (conceptual breadth, logical nesting, exploration), and established human and model-based evaluation protocols.

Result: Leading DR agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieved under 68% average compliance with rubrics, primarily failing on implicit context understanding and reasoning about retrieved information.

Conclusion: There is significant need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, and ResearchRubrics provides a standardized benchmark to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) is an emerging agent application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to address open-ended queries. It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants.

*Soham Hans,Volkan Ustun,Benjamin Nye,James Sterrett,Matthew Green*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework for generating complex military training scenarios and OPORDs through hierarchical decomposition and specialized reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scenario generation for military training is labor-intensive, and pre-LLM AI tools failed to produce sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of scenario generation into subproblems, with specialized LLM agents handling different tasks (option generation, candidate production, or full automation), integrating text and visual information while maintaining logical consistency.

Result: Proof-of-concept successfully generated scheme of maneuver and movement sections of OPORDs with accurate map position estimation, demonstrating feasibility and coherence.

Conclusion: LLM-driven multi-agent systems show potential for generating nuanced, adaptable military training scenarios, advancing automation in this domain.

Abstract: Achieving expert-level performance in simulation-based training relies on the creation of complex, adaptable scenarios, a traditionally laborious and resource intensive process. Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.

*Sunghyun Wee,Suyoung Kim,Hyeonjin Kim,Kyomin Hwang,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAQ is a novel quantization method that preserves LLM safety alignment during post-training quantization by using contrastive loss to maintain alignment with safe instruction-tuned models while diverging from unaligned pre-trained counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional PTQ focuses only on perplexity optimization, which can degrade model safety alignment - creating a conflict between efficiency and safety objectives in LLM deployment.

Method: Alignment-Aware Quantization (AAQ) integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive (APC) loss into PTQ pipeline, encouraging quantized models to mimic safe instruction-tuned versions while diverging from unaligned pre-trained counterparts.

Result: AAQ enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral models while maintaining safety where previous methods fail, without requiring specialized safety calibration datasets.

Conclusion: The method resolves the efficiency-safety trade-off in LLM quantization, enabling both efficient and trustworthy models through alignment-preserving quantization techniques.

Abstract: Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAMA is a neural neighborhood search method for Vehicle Routing Problems that uses Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention to better capture structural and semantic context through separate encoding of problem instances and solutions with cross-attention interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural approaches for VRPs use simplistic state representations and naive information fusion, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context needed for effective routing decisions.

Method: Encodes problem instance and evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, models intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers, and uses gated fusion to integrate multi-modal representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show GAMA significantly outperforms recent neural baselines across various synthetic and benchmark instances.

Conclusion: The multi-modal attention mechanism and gated fusion design are key to achieving performance gains, demonstrating the importance of rich contextual modeling in neural neighborhood search for VRPs.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural neighborhood search methods have shown potential in tackling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic state representations and fuse heterogeneous information via naive concatenation, limiting their ability to capture rich structural and semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose GAMA, a neural neighborhood search method with Graph-aware Multi-modal Attention model in VRP. GAMA encodes the problem instance and its evolving solution as distinct modalities using graph neural networks, and models their intra- and inter-modal interactions through stacked self- and cross-attention layers. A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions. Extensive experiments conducted across various synthetic and benchmark instances demonstrate that the proposed algorithm GAMA significantly outperforms the recent neural baselines. Further ablation studies confirm that both the multi-modal attention mechanism and the gated fusion design play a key role in achieving the observed performance gains.

### [188] [WaterMod: Modular Token-Rank Partitioning for Probability-Balanced LLM Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07863)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WaterMod introduces a probability-aware modular watermarking method that maintains text quality while embedding imperceptible provenance marks in LLM outputs, supporting both binary attribution and multi-bit payloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of conventional logit-based watermarks that can exclude high-probability tokens and degrade fluency, while complying with regulations requiring machine-verifiable provenance marks for synthetic content.

Method: Sorts vocabulary by probability, partitions tokens using residue rank mod k, applies small bias to selected class. Uses entropy-adaptive gate for zero-bit setting (k=2) and payload-driven selection for multi-bit regime (k>2).

Result: WaterMod achieves strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality across natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The modular arithmetic approach supports both binary attribution and rich payloads, providing robust watermarking without compromising text quality in various applications.

Abstract: Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/WaterMod.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A confidence-aware brain-computer interface framework that uses deep ensembles of speech-oriented convolutional networks with uncertainty quantification and selective classification for reliable EEG-based speech decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that are both accurate and trustworthy for decoding spoken commands from EEG signals, requiring reliable confidence estimates and selective decision-making.

Method: Deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks combined with post-hoc calibration and selective classification using ensemble-based uncertainty metrics (predictive entropy, top-two margin, mutual information) with an abstain option governed by accuracy-coverage tradeoff.

Result: The method produces more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance compared to widely used baselines, evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using leakage-safe block-stratified splits.

Conclusion: Confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems by ensuring trustworthy decision-making with uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces that decode spoken commands from electroencephalogram must be both accurate and trustworthy. We present a confidence-aware decoding framework that couples deep ensembles of compact, speech-oriented convolutional networks with post-hoc calibration and selective classification. Uncertainty is quantified using ensemble-based predictive entropy, top-two margin, and mutual information, and decisions are made with an abstain option governed by an accuracy-coverage operating point. The approach is evaluated on a multi-class overt speech dataset using a leakage-safe, block-stratified split that respects temporal contiguity. Compared with widely used baselines, the proposed method yields more reliable probability estimates, improved selective performance across operating points, and balanced per-class acceptance. These results suggest that confidence-aware neural decoding can provide robust, deployment-oriented behavior for real-world brain-computer interface communication systems.

*Ha-Na Jo,Jung-Sun Lee,Eunyeong Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EEG-based communication system for aphasia patients detects speech intention despite misarticulations using delta power features and multitask learning, achieving 58.6% accuracy for correct speech and 45.5% for misarticulated trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, with little attention paid to EEG-based communication support systems for aphasic patients.

Method: Recorded EEG signals during Korean automatic speech tasks, used spectral analysis to identify neural patterns, and developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization focusing on delta features.

Result: Misarticulated trials showed excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. The model achieved 58.6% accuracy for correct trials and 45.5% for misarticulated trials, outperforming baseline by over 45% on misarticulated trials.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients through robust intention decoding despite articulation errors.

Abstract: Aphasia severely limits verbal communication due to impaired language production, often leading to frequent misarticulations during speech attempts. Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients.

*Dengcan Liu,Jiahao Li,Zheren Fu,Yi Tu,Jiajun Li,Zhendong Mao,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparseRM is a lightweight reward model that uses Sparse Autoencoder to extract preference-relevant features from LLM representations, achieving superior performance with less than 1% trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training reliable reward models under limited resources is challenging due to dependency on large-scale preference annotations and high fine-tuning costs of LLMs.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoder to decompose LLM representations into interpretable preference-relevant directions, projects representations onto these directions to compute alignment scores, and aggregates scores with a simple reward head.

Result: Achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs on three preference modeling tasks while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SparseRM provides an efficient and interpretable approach for reward modeling that integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are a core component in the post-training of large language models (LLMs), serving as proxies for human preference evaluation and guiding model alignment. However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment.

TL;DR: A novel approach to explain data using textual descriptions generated by large language models, enhanced by influence estimation and CLIP scoring to select informative descriptions, with cross-modal transfer classification as a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of deep learning models by explaining data through human-understandable language, moving beyond traditional model-focused explanations to data-centric interpretability.

Method: Proposes a pipeline using LLMs with external knowledge bases to generate textual descriptions, applies influence estimation and CLIP scoring to filter irrelevant information, and introduces cross-modal transfer classification as evaluation benchmark.

Result: In zero-shot settings, the generated textual descriptions outperform baseline descriptions and boost performance of image-only trained models across nine classification datasets, with GPT-4o evaluation confirming effectiveness.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into model decision-making interpretability through effective cross-modal data explanations, demonstrating practical utility in enhancing model performance and understanding.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been successful in many areas but understanding their behaviors still remains a black-box. Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets, demonstrating effectiveness and generalization ability across six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DANS-KGC effectively addresses limitations of traditional negative sampling methods and shows superior performance in knowledge graph completion tasks through its adaptive and dynamic approach.

Abstract: Negative sampling (NS) strategies play a crucial role in knowledge graph representation. In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DANS-KGC, with the method achieving state-of-the-art results on all three evaluation metrics for the UMLS and YAGO3-10 datasets.

Motivation: To understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying human adaptive reasoning and compare them with artificial intelligence systems, particularly investigating how humans flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules change.

Method: Used a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze neural dynamics, and compared human performance with a multimodal large language model through stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses.

Result: Humans showed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity for exploratory monitoring and rule inference, and occipital alpha engagement for confirmatory attention stabilization after successful rule identification. The multimodal large language model only exhibited short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction.

Conclusion: The findings identify specific neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired AI that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation, as current large language models lack genuine adaptive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning enables humans to flexibly adjust inference strategies when environmental rules or contexts change, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. This study investigated the neurophysiological mechanisms of adaptive reasoning using a card-sorting paradigm combined with electroencephalography and compared human performance with that of a multimodal large language model. Stimulus- and feedback-locked analyses revealed coordinated delta-theta-alpha dynamics: early delta-theta activity reflected exploratory monitoring and rule inference, whereas occipital alpha engagement indicated confirmatory stabilization of attention after successful rule identification. In contrast, the multimodal large language model exhibited only short-term feedback-driven adjustments without hierarchical rule abstraction or genuine adaptive reasoning. These findings identify the neural signatures of human adaptive reasoning and highlight the need for brain-inspired artificial intelligence that incorporates oscillatory feedback coordination for true context-sensitive adaptation.

Abstract: Personalized mathematics education is growing rapidly, creating a strong demand for large sets of similar practice problems. Yet existing studies on mathematics problem generation have focused on data augmentation for training neural language models rather than on direct educational deployment. To bridge this gap, we define a new task, Isomorphic Math Problem Generation (IMPG), designed to produce structurally consistent variants of source problems. Subsequently, we explored LLM-based frameworks for automatic IMPG through successive refinements, and established Computational Blueprints for Isomorphic Twins (CBIT). With meta-level generation and template-based selective variation, CBIT achieves high mathematical correctness and structural consistency while reducing the cost of generation. Empirical results across refinements demonstrate that CBIT is superior on generation accuracy and cost-effectiveness at scale. Most importantly, CBIT-generated problems exhibited an error rate 17.8% lower than expert-authored items, with deployment to 6,732 learners on a commercial education platform yielding 186,870 interactions.

Result: With only several hundred training samples, Thinker performs competitively with established baselines. When scaled to full training set, it significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Conclusion: Thinker enables supervised and verifiable reasoning processes while efficiently leveraging external knowledge bases, demonstrating strong performance with minimal training data and scalability across different model sizes.

Abstract: Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

*He Panjing,Cheng Mingyue,Li Li,Zhang XiaoHan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeFlow is a novel SDE-based flow matching framework for time series generation that combines encoder-only architecture with component-wise decomposed velocity fields and stochastic augmentation to efficiently capture temporal stochasticity and outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high-quality time series data generation to support downstream mining tasks, addressing the challenge of modeling intrinsic stochasticity in temporal dynamics while overcoming the computational inefficiency of diffusion models and the limited fidelity of conventional ODE-based flow matching.

Method: Proposes TimeFlow framework using stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with encoder-only architecture, component-wise decomposed velocity fields to capture multi-faceted time series structure, and augmented flow-matching optimization with additional stochastic term.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show TimeFlow consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Conclusion: TimeFlow provides a flexible and general framework supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks, effectively addressing stochasticity modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generating high-quality time series data has emerged as a critical research topic due to its broad utility in supporting downstream time series mining tasks. A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VARS is a graph-based ECG diagnosis method that handles diverse signal configurations and improves risk signal detection through denoising reconstruction and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG diagnosis methods lack versatility for diverse signal configurations and have inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances.

Method: Transforms ECG signals into versatile graph structures, integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw information while highlighting diagnostic patterns.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models across three datasets, shows substantial improvement in identifying risk signals, and provides interpretability by pinpointing diagnostic waveforms.

Conclusion: VARS emerges as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment by addressing key limitations in current ECG analysis methods.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal diagnosis and analysis methods through deep learning, two major hurdles still limit their clinical adoption: the lack of versatility in processing ECG signals with diverse configurations, and the inadequate detection of risk signals due to sample imbalances. Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.

*Lintong Zhang,Kang Yin,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates object-level and part-level interpretability to identify which fine-grained features cause model misclassification and where local features influence counterfactual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attribution-based explanation techniques lack sufficient granularity for insight in fine-grained tasks, especially when models misclassify, making explanations insufficiently detailed.

Method: Non-generative approach that quantifies similarity and weights component contributions between correctly classified and misclassified samples, with a saliency partition module using Shapley values to isolate region-specific relevant features.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach captures more granular, intuitively meaningful regions and surpasses fine-grained methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of attribution-based explanations by providing fine-grained counterfactual explanations that identify specific features contributing to misclassification.

Abstract: Attribution-based explanation techniques capture key patterns to enhance visual interpretability; however, these patterns often lack the granularity needed for insight in fine-grained tasks, particularly in cases of model misclassification, where explanations may be insufficiently detailed. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained counterfactual explanation framework that generates both object-level and part-level interpretability, addressing two fundamental questions: (1) which fine-grained features contribute to model misclassification, and (2) where dominant local features influence counterfactual adjustments. Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples. Furthermore, we introduce a saliency partition module grounded in Shapley value contributions, isolating features with region-specific relevance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing more granular, intuitively meaningful regions, surpassing fine-grained methods.

Conclusion: MSLR advances LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies, providing open resources for future research on legal reasoning and structured multi-step inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-SAM is a novel spatial-temporal self-attention model for traffic forecasting that captures joint spatial-temporal dependencies using self-attention mechanisms, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches studied spatial and temporal dependencies separately, failing to capture their joint effect, which is crucial for accurate traffic forecasting due to the complex interdependence between regions.

Method: Uses region embedding to learn time-specific embeddings and employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture joint dependencies for both nearby and faraway regions.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show ST-SAM achieves up to 15% improvement on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times faster training time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: ST-SAM effectively captures both local and global spatial-temporal correlations using self-attention, making it both accurate and efficient for traffic forecasting tasks.

Abstract: We study the problem of traffic forecasting, aiming to predict the inflow and outflow of a region in the subsequent time slot. The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).

### [205] [VSPO: Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology via LLM-Based CQ Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07991)
*Hyojun Choi,Seokju Hwang,Kyong-Ho Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces VSPO, a novel dataset and model for generating competency questions (CQs) that validate semantic pitfalls in ontology design, using fine-tuned LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to detect modeling errors like 'Misusing allValuesFrom' that existing methods miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CQ creation is time-consuming and costly, and existing automated approaches fail to detect semantic pitfalls in ontology design, necessitating a method that can validate semantic discrepancies between natural language definitions and formal axioms.

Method: The authors use LLMs to generate natural language definitions, introduce misalignments by removing axioms or altering logical operators, and fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieves 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation, and the generated CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing datasets.

Conclusion: This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge, representing the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) play a crucial role in validating ontology design. While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as "Misusing allValuesFrom". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs.

TL;DR: Proposes PN-GNN to enhance logical expressive power of GNNs for knowledge graph reasoning by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths, showing superior expressiveness over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN studies focus on simple single-relation graphs with insufficient discussion on logical rule expression in knowledge graphs. Enhancing logical expressive power of GNNs remains a key challenge.

Method: Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN) aggregates node-neighbor embeddings on reasoning paths. Analyzes existing GNN limitations and theoretically proves PN-GNN's superior expressiveness.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows PN-GNN has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN, with (k+1)-hop expressiveness superior to k-hop. Experiments on 6 synthetic and 2 real-world datasets confirm enhanced logical rule expression without compromising generalization.

Conclusion: PN-GNN effectively enhances logical expressive power of GNNs for knowledge graph reasoning, achieving competitive performance while maintaining generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively model structural information of graphs, making them widely used in knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel multi-view multi-label feature selection method that combines LLM semantic reasoning with GNN structural modeling to jointly leverage statistical and semantic information for improved feature selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVMLFS methods mainly focus on statistical information but neglect semantic information, which is crucial for understanding complex relationships in high-dimensional, multimodal data from domains like social media and bioinformatics.

Method: Three-component approach: (1) LLM evaluates semantic relevance among features, views, and labels; (2) Constructs semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with semantic and statistical graphs; (3) Uses lightweight GAT to learn node embeddings as feature saliency scores for ranking.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmark datasets, effective even on small-scale datasets, demonstrating robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The proposed LLM-GNN integration successfully combines semantic and statistical information for MVMLFS, achieving better performance and maintaining effectiveness across different dataset scales.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label feature selection aims to identify informative features from heterogeneous views, where each sample is associated with multiple interdependent labels. This problem is particularly important in machine learning involving high-dimensional, multimodal data such as social media, bioinformatics or recommendation systems. Existing Multi-View Multi-Label Feature Selection (MVMLFS) methods mainly focus on analyzing statistical information of data, but seldom consider semantic information. In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability.

*Zhishen Sun,Guang Dai,Ivor Tsang,Haishan Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A perturbation framework evaluates LLMs' mathematical reasoning by injecting irrelevant sentences and missing core instructions, revealing performance declines especially with numerical perturbations and suggesting reliance on pattern matching rather than true reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs possess genuine mathematical understanding capabilities by testing their robustness in complex reasoning environments through controlled perturbations.

Method: Proposed a perturbation framework that injects semantically irrelevant sentences with varying intensity levels and uses core questioning instruction missing to analyze LLMs' problem-solving mechanisms.

Result: LLMs show stable performance with non-numerical perturbations but decline significantly with numerical perturbations (up to 51.55% drop). Even advanced models show 3-10% performance drops. Models maintain 20-40% accuracy without core instructions, suggesting pattern matching reliance.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in mathematical reasoning capabilities, being sensitive to numerical perturbations and potentially relying on memory templates rather than logical reasoning, highlighting areas for future development.

Abstract: LLMs have made significant progress in the field of mathematical reasoning, but whether they have true the mathematical understanding ability is still controversial. To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address logical inconsistencies and lack of domain knowledge grounding in LLMs for biomolecular reasoning, where existing approaches fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies and deviate from biological facts.

Method: Proposes a framework that constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on knowledge graphs, incorporates these chains into supervised fine-tuning for factual grounding, and refines with reinforcement learning for reasoning reliability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks requiring traversal of structured biological knowledge, with clear advantages as reasoning depth increases compared to larger closed-source models.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies enables reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning, demonstrating effectiveness particularly for complex multi-hop tasks.

Abstract: Understanding complex biomolecular mechanisms requires multi-step reasoning across molecular interactions, signaling cascades, and metabolic pathways. While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.

Motivation: Current LLMs lack in-depth exploration of System 2 reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency, despite sophisticated problem-solving capabilities. The research aims to bridge this gap using psychological theories to optimize cognitive pathways.

Method: A novel Scaffold Reasoning framework with three streams: Scaffold Stream (constructs reference code), Analytic Stream (analyzes buggy code), and Integration Stream (integrates both streams). The framework draws from psychological theories of System 1 and System 2 reasoning.

Result: Achieved 88.91% pass rate and average inference time of 5.36 seconds per problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses revealed advantages and limitations across different problem difficulties and bug types.

Conclusion: The proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework effectively balances reasoning complexity and computational efficiency, aligns with human cognitive processes, and demonstrates superior performance in code debugging tasks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving capabilities on various benchmarks through advanced reasoning algorithms. However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.

### [213] [Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066)
*Cheng Yuan,Jiawei Shao,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'information capacity' as a unified metric for LLM efficiency, measuring compression performance relative to computational complexity, which enables fair comparisons across different model sizes and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified metric that accurately reflects LLM efficiency across different model sizes and architectures, despite growing computational demands and test-time scaling practices.

Method: Propose information capacity based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity, evaluating 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets while considering tokenizer efficiency.

Result: Models of varying sizes within a series show consistent information capacity, enabling fair efficiency comparisons across model series and accurate performance prediction within a series.

Conclusion: Information capacity effectively measures LLM efficiency, incorporating often-neglected factors like tokenizer efficiency, and shows consistent patterns across different model architectures and training data.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A clustering-based approach using extended fuzzy clustering and Particle Swarm Optimization to detect anomalies in multivariate time series by analyzing amplitude and shape patterns through reconstruction criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multivariate time series anomaly detection is challenging due to the need to simultaneously consider temporal and variable relationships, with applications in science and engineering.

Method: Uses sliding windows to generate multivariate subsequences, applies extended fuzzy clustering to reveal structure, employs reconstruction criteria with cluster centers and partition matrix, and uses Particle Swarm Optimization for optimization.

Result: Experimental studies on synthetic and real-world datasets show the method can effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully detects anomalies in multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various domains like healthcare, weather analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

Abstract: Multivariate time series data come as a collection of time series describing different aspects of a certain temporal phenomenon. Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for reliable AI in reinsurance by translating existing prudential supervisory expectations into measurable lifecycle controls for large language models.

Method: Developed a five-pillar architecture (governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, regulatory alignment) and implemented it through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB) to evaluate LLM compliance with prudential standards.

Result: Retrieval-grounded configurations achieved 0.90 grounding accuracy, reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by ~40%, and nearly doubled transparency across six task families.

Conclusion: Existing prudential doctrines can accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable, lowering informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation.

Abstract: This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy satisfiability is computationally intractable in classical settings, motivating the search for tractable fragments through parameterized complexity.

Method: Using parameterized complexity with parameters like primal treewidth and number of variables, departing from dynamic programming to exploit structural characterizations of causal models.

Result: Developed fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, with matching hardness results establishing tractability boundaries.

Conclusion: Identified first tractable gateways for Pearl's Causal Hierarchy satisfiability through parameterized complexity, providing new algorithmic tools for causal reasoning.

Abstract: Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) is a central framework for reasoning about probabilistic, interventional, and counterfactual statements, yet the satisfiability problem for PCH formulas is computationally intractable in almost all classical settings. We revisit this challenge through the lens of parameterized complexity and identify the first gateways to tractability. Our results include fixed-parameter and XP-algorithms for satisfiability in key probabilistic and counterfactual fragments, using parameters such as primal treewidth and the number of variables, together with matching hardness results that map the limits of tractability. Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.

Motivation: Machine learning models lack interpretability in industrial quality control, and many industrial machines have limited sensor technology, making data acquisition challenging. XAI offers solutions by providing model insights and identifying relevant features.

Method: Applied SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in an LSTM model trained on real production data. Reduced original 19 input features to 9 and 6, evaluating trade-offs between accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability.

Result: Feature reduction improved generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with a small increase in inference speed. The approach enhances feasibility of AI-driven quality control in industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities.

Conclusion: XAI-based feature reduction enables more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing, particularly beneficial for industrial environments with constrained sensor technology.

Abstract: Machine learning is an essential tool for optimizing industrial quality control processes. However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.

Abstract: Machine learning has significant potential for optimizing various industrial processes. However, data acquisition remains a major challenge as it is both time-consuming and costly. Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste. This approach provides a valuable alternative for situations where extensive data collection and maintenance has been impractical or costly and thus could contribute to more efficient manufacturing processes in the future.

TL;DR: SpeechCARE is a multimodal speech processing pipeline using transformer models to detect cognitive impairment through acoustic and linguistic features, achieving high performance in classifying Alzheimer's disease and related dementias with minimal bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 50% of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed, and conventional speech-based assessment methods have limited performance and generalizability for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.

Method: Uses pretrained multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models with dynamic fusion architecture inspired by Mixture of Experts, incorporating robust preprocessing (automatic transcription, LLM-based anomaly detection), SHAP-based explainability, and bias mitigation techniques like oversampling and weighted loss.

Result: Achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities except for adults over 80.

Conclusion: SpeechCARE demonstrates effective multimodal speech processing for cognitive impairment detection with strong performance and explainability, with future work focusing on real-world deployment in healthcare settings and EHR integration for underrepresented populations.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect one in five adults over 60, yet more than half of individuals with cognitive decline remain undiagnosed. Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss. Future work includes deployment in real-world care settings (e.g., VNS Health, Columbia ADRC) and EHR-integrated explainability for underrepresented populations in New York City.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

Abstract: Visual grounding is the task of localising image regions from natural language queries and is critical for reasoning capable Graphical User Interface agents. Many existing methods rely on massive, noisy synthetic datasets.This work introduces an efficient training pipeline that combines model-based data filtering with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. From 4.8M synthetic examples, 12K clean and diverse instances are curated by first identifying challenging cases, removing misaligned and then selecting a diverse set of multimodal instances. On this data, a 3B-parameter Vision-Language Model is trained under three regimes: supervised fine-tuning, chain-of-thought- augmented fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Models trained with the filtered data and lightweight training strategies match or surpass larger baselines on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and AndroidControl. These results demonstrate that principled data curation and robust adaptation can rival large-scale training, enabling compact yet capable multimodal reasoning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in machine learning where user data is collected without consent, by creating data that prevents models from learning effectively while appearing natural.

Method: An optimization-based approach using projected gradient ascent to systematically maximize Bayes error, which measures irreducible classification error.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures show the method effectively restricts data learnability and remains functional when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean samples.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a theoretically grounded method for creating unlearnable examples that maintain effectiveness in practical scenarios where clean and unlearnable data are mixed.

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning models, especially large-scale classifiers and language models, relies heavily on training with massive data. These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAC is a novel action generation method that preserves geometric properties of spherical distributions while simplifying computation, achieving better performance than Gaussian policies in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian policies in continuous RL have a fundamental mismatch with bounded action spaces, requiring ad-hoc squashing functions that distort geometry. While vMF distributions offer theoretical benefits, their computational complexity hinders practical use.

Method: GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This reduces parameters from 2d to d+1 and avoids O(dk) complexity of vMF.

Result: GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and best results on 4 out of 6 tasks.

Conclusion: Robust and efficient continuous control doesn't require complex distributions but principled respect for action space geometry. Both spherical normalization and adaptive concentration control are essential to GAC's success.

Abstract: Gaussian policies have dominated continuous control in deep reinforcement learning (RL), yet they suffer from a fundamental mismatch: their unbounded support requires ad-hoc squashing functions that distort the geometry of bounded action spaces. While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \(2d\) to \(d+1\), and avoids the \(O(dk)\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \(O(d)\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \textbf{spherical normalization} and \textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces. Code and pretrained models are available in supplementary materials.

Result: Hybrid Agent performed best across most metrics with 88.8% Goal Completion Rate and highest ROI, revealing significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs.

Conclusion: Provides a standardized methodology for holistic AI agent evaluation that enables effective development, deployment, and governance across diverse applications.

Abstract: As AI agents proliferate across industries and applications, evaluating their performance based solely on infrastructural metrics such as latency, time-to-first-token, or token throughput is proving insufficient. These metrics fail to capture the quality of an agent's decisions, its operational autonomy, or its ultimate business value. This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI). This work provides a robust, standardized methodology for the holistic evaluation of AI agents, paving the way for more effective development, deployment, and governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STV is a Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework that identifies optimal locations and values for inserting task vectors in Large Multimodal Models to improve many-shot in-context learning while addressing context length and inference cost limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models face challenges in scaling to many-shot in-context learning due to limited context length and high inference costs. Existing task-vector methods either ignore optimal insertion locations or struggle to determine suitable values for each location.

Method: STV identifies sensitive-aware locations by analyzing consistent structural patterns in activation deltas across query-context pairs. It constructs pre-clustered activation banks for each location and uses reinforcement learning to select the most suitable values for insertion.

Result: STV demonstrates effectiveness across various multimodal models (Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (VizWiz, OK-VQA), showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed STV framework successfully addresses the challenges of many-shot in-context learning by systematically determining where and what to insert task vectors, providing a reliable and effective solution for scaling multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, but scaling to many-shot settings remains difficult due to limited context length and high inference cost. To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.

TL;DR: Multi-Agent GraphRAG system using LLM agents for text-to-Cypher query generation on Labeled Property Graph databases, with automated query generation, execution, and iterative correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GraphRAG research focuses mainly on RDF knowledge graphs and SPARQL queries, leaving the potential of Cypher and LPG databases underexplored for scalable reasoning in GraphRAG pipelines.

Method: Modular LLM agentic system with automated Cypher query generation and execution using Memgraph backend, featuring iterative content-aware correction and normalization with aggregated feedback loops.

Result: System evaluated on CypherBench dataset across general domains and demonstrated on IFC property graph data for building digital twins, showing effective query generation and execution.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation by leveraging LPG-based graph data through natural language interfaces.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods commonly draw information from unstructured documents, the emerging paradigm of GraphRAG aims to leverage structured data such as knowledge graphs. Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries. We evaluate our system on the CypherBench graph dataset covering several general domains with diverse types of queries. In addition, we demonstrate performance of the proposed workflow on a property graph derived from the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data, representing a digital twin of a building. This highlights how such an approach can bridge AI with real-world applications at scale, enabling industrial digital automation use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM tools are text-only, limiting their usefulness in visualization-dependent domains like mathematics where diagrams are essential. There's a need for scalable evaluation of LLM-generated educational figures.

Method: Proposed DiagramIR pipeline that uses intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code to automatically evaluate geometric figures generated by LLMs.

Result: DiagramIR shows higher agreement with human raters compared to LLM-as-a-Judge baselines. It enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models like GPT-5 at 10x lower inference cost.

Conclusion: DiagramIR provides an effective and scalable evaluation approach for LLM-generated educational diagrams, making accessible education technologies more deployable by reducing computational costs while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as tools for learning; however, most tools remain text-only, limiting their usefulness for domains where visualizations are essential, such as mathematics. Recent work shows that LLMs are capable of generating code that compiles to educational figures, but a major bottleneck remains: scalable evaluation of these diagrams. We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters. This evaluation approach also enables smaller models like GPT-4.1-Mini to perform comparably to larger models such as GPT-5 at a 10x lower inference cost, which is important for deploying accessible and scalable education technologies.

TL;DR: Spark is a shared agentic memory architecture that enables AI coding agents to collectively learn and share knowledge, improving code quality and matching larger models' performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to agent-centric software development has disrupted traditional knowledge sharing, leaving AI agents without access to shared learning repositories despite generating significant code.

Method: Introduces Spark, a shared agentic memory architecture that allows AI coding agents to contribute to and draw from a persistent experiential memory for collective continual learning.

Result: Spark improved code quality across various model sizes, enabling a 30B parameter model to match state-of-the-art larger models. Recommendations achieved 98.2% helpfulness in top qualitative bands.

Conclusion: Spark effectively emulates human developer communities' collective intelligence, providing AI agents with valuable shared learning that enhances code generation quality and efficiency.

Abstract: The transition from human-centric to agent-centric software development practices is disrupting existing knowledge sharing environments for software developers. Traditional peer-to-peer repositories and developer communities for shared technical knowledge and best practice have witnessed dramatic drops in participation in a short period of time. At the same time, agentic functional equivalents are yet to emerge leaving AI agents, which already generate a significant proportion of all new software code produced, without access to repositories of valuable shared learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Spark, a novel shared agentic memory architecture which is designed to emulate the collective intelligence and know-how of human developer communities. Spark enables AI coding agents to both contribute to and draw from a persistent and continuously evolving experiential memory. Agents operating in the same general problem space use the Spark shared memory as a repository of new knowledge to achieve collective continual learning. We evaluate Spark as a coach for AI coding agents performing software development tasks. We demonstrate that recommendations made by Spark improve the quality of code generated by generic code generation models at varying sizes and capability tiers. Boosted by Spark, a small open-weights model with 30 billion parameters was able to match the code quality afforded by a much larger state-of-the-art model. Separately, we measure the intrinsic quality of recommendations generated by Spark against a wide range of criteria inspired by software development best practice, and achieve helpfulness levels of up to 98.2% in the top two (out of five) qualitative helpfulness bands.

Conclusion: The cloud-based platform significantly reduces manual intervention in data analysis while delivering high-quality visualizations and user experiences.

Abstract: An AI-powered data visualization platform that automates the entire data analysis process, from uploading a dataset to generating an interactive visualization. Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to clean and preprocess the data, analyse its features, and automatically select appropriate visualizations. The system establishes the process of automating AI-based analysis and visualization from the context of data-driven environments, and eliminates the challenge of time-consuming manual data analysis. The combination of a Python Flask backend to access the dataset, paired with a React frontend, provides a robust platform that automatically interacts with Firebase Cloud Storage for numerous data processing and data analysis solutions and real-time sources. Key contributions include automatic and intelligent data cleaning, with imputation for missing values, and detection of outliers, via analysis of the data set. AI solutions to intelligently select features, using four different algorithms, and intelligent title generation and visualization are determined by the attributes of the dataset. These contributions were evaluated using two separate datasets to assess the platform's performance. In the process evaluation, the initial analysis was performed in real-time on datasets as large as 100000 rows, while the cloud-based demand platform scales to meet requests from multiple users and processes them simultaneously. In conclusion, the cloud-based data visualization application allowed for a significant reduction of manual inputs to the data analysis process while maintaining a high quality, impactful visual outputs, and user experiences

*Giorgio Piras,Raffaele Mura,Fabio Brau,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions from language models, showing this multi-direction approach outperforms single-direction methods and jailbreak algorithms in suppressing refusal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches encode refusal behavior as a single direction in latent space, but evidence suggests concepts in LLMs are encoded as low-dimensional manifolds. The authors aim to capture the multi-faceted nature of refusal behavior.

Method: Train Self-Organizing Maps on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons, then subtract the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron to derive multiple refusal directions. Prove that SOMs generalize the prior difference-in-means technique.

Result: Ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms both the single-direction baseline and specialized jailbreak algorithms, effectively suppressing refusal behavior.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-direction refusal modeling and provides mechanistic insights into how refusal behavior is encoded in language models.

Abstract: Refusal refers to the functional behavior enabling safety-aligned language models to reject harmful or unethical prompts. Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach.

TL;DR: FaithEval framework for evaluating faithfulness in LLM reasoning, and FaithAct framework that enforces evidential grounding at every step to improve perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address persistent unfaithfulness in LLMs where models produce plausible but ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions.

Method: Distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (reasoning-output alignment) and perceptual faithfulness (reasoning-input alignment). Introduce FaithEval for step-level and chain-level faithfulness evaluation, and FaithAct framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step.

Result: FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% across multiple reasoning benchmarks without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

Conclusion: Treating faithfulness as a guiding principle mitigates hallucination and leads to more stable reasoning trajectories, establishing a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: Proposes patching LLMs like software versions - a lightweight method using small learnable prefixes (0.003% additional parameters) to fix safety vulnerabilities without full model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Major LLM releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to customize, leaving released models with known safety gaps that need rapid remediation.

Method: Prepends a compact, learnable prefix to existing models to steer behavior toward safer reference models, requiring minimal parameter overhead.

Result: Achieves safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models across toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal while preserving fluency.

Conclusion: LLMs can be effectively patched like software, providing vendors and practitioners with scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major releases.

Abstract: We propose patching for large language models (LLMs) like software versions, a lightweight and modular approach for addressing safety vulnerabilities. While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This "patch" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can be "patched" much like software, offering vendors and practitioners a practical mechanism for distributing scalable, efficient, and composable safety updates between major model releases.

TL;DR: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of mathematical interestingness but fail to capture the full distribution of human judgments and show weak alignment with human reasoning about why problems are interesting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly participate in mathematics with humans, it's important to understand how well their judgments about mathematical interestingness and difficulty align with human ones, especially for AI thought partnerships in research and education.

Method: Two empirical studies comparing human and LLM assessments of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, involving participants from crowdsourcing platforms and International Math Olympiad competitors across a range of mathematical experience levels.

Result: LLMs broadly agree with human notions of interestingness but do not capture the full distribution of human judgments. Most LLMs show weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales and only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both promises and limitations in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships - they broadly agree on what's interesting but fail to fully capture human reasoning and judgment distributions.

Abstract: The evolution of mathematics has been guided in part by interestingness. From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.

Conclusion: The SNN-HDC decoding method represents a compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding approaches due to its multiple performance benefits.

Abstract: This work presents a novel spiking neural network (SNN) decoding method, combining SNNs with Hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The goal is to create a decoding method with high accuracy, high noise robustness, low latency and low energy usage. Compared to analogous architectures decoded with existing approaches, the presented SNN-HDC model attains generally better classification accuracy, lower classification latency and lower estimated energy consumption on multiple test cases from literature. The SNN-HDC achieved estimated energy consumption reductions ranging from 1.24x to 3.67x on the DvsGesture dataset and from 1.38x to 2.27x on the SL-Animals-DVS dataset. The presented decoding method can also efficiently identify unknown classes it has not been trained on. In the DvsGesture dataset the SNN-HDC model can identify 100% of samples from an unseen/untrained class. Given the numerous benefits shown and discussed in this paper, this decoding method represents a very compelling alternative to both rate and latency decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI combines neural and symbolic approaches but faces scalability limitations that restrict practical usability, particularly for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases.

Method: DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks for efficient neural guidance, and establishes a formal mapping between resolution processes and Markov Decision Processes to enable dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: Experiments on standard neurosymbolic benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks show DPrL outperforms state-of-the-art neurosymbolic systems and achieves scalability to larger, more complex settings than previously possible.

Conclusion: DPrL successfully addresses the scalability limitations of neurosymbolic AI while maintaining the benefits of accuracy, interpretability, and generalization, enabling practical application to complex real-world problems.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.

TL;DR: This survey conceptualizes video foundation models as implicit world models with video renderers, tracing their evolution through four generations toward physically plausible, interactive systems capable of multi-scale planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from generating visually appealing videos to building interactive virtual environments that maintain physical plausibility points toward video foundation models functioning as implicit world models.

Method: Systematic analysis of video generation evolution through four generations, conceptualizing models as combination of implicit world models (encoding physical laws, interactions, agent behavior) and video renderers (transforming latent simulations into visual observations).

Result: Identifies progression toward world models with intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and multi-scale planning capabilities, with applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and gaming.

Conclusion: Video foundation models are evolving into sophisticated world models that can simulate physical dynamics and support interaction, with ongoing challenges in agent intelligence integration and system evaluation.

Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.
