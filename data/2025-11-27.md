### [1] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pygmalion Effect in Vision is a novel framework that transforms reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation to enable robust 3D reconstruction from multi-view images with complex reflections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflection remains a major challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections, which complicates accurate geometry estimation.

Method: A dual-branch network with BRDF-based reflective branch and clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals, trained jointly using synthesized clay-like images as reflection-free supervision.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that 'seeing by unshining' - translating radiance into neutrality - serves as a powerful inductive bias for learning reflective object geometry.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

### [2] [CtrlVDiff: Controllable Video Generation via Unified Multimodal Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21129)
*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff is a unified diffusion framework that addresses both video understanding and controllable generation by incorporating multiple graphics-based modalities (depth, normals, segmentation, edges, albedo, roughness, metallic) to enable precise video editing while maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geometry-only cues are insufficient for video understanding and generation as they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits and causing temporal drift.

Method: Proposes CtrlVDiff with Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from multiple modalities, trained on MMVideo dataset - a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions.

Result: Superior controllability and fidelity across understanding and generation benchmarks, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust to missing modalities.

Conclusion: Enriching models with additional graphics-based modalities provides complementary constraints that disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during video generation, achieving strong temporal coherence and robust performance.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [3] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates membership inference attacks on multi-modal vision-language models and introduces a neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework to improve privacy resilience without compromising model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal models introduce new privacy attack vectors, and while neuro-inspired representations improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it's unknown if they provide similar protection against privacy attacks in multi-modal systems.

Method: The authors developed a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization framework and tested it on three VLMs (BLIP, PaliGemma 2, ViT-GPT2) across three datasets (COCO, CC3M, NoCaps), comparing baseline models with neuro variants using tau > 0 regularization.

Result: NEURO VLMs showed 24% mean ROC-AUC drop in MIA attack success on BLIP with COCO dataset while maintaining similar model utility in MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. Results were consistent across other models and datasets.

Conclusion: Neuro-inspired multi-modal vision-language models are more resilient against privacy attacks while preserving model utility, contributing to understanding privacy risks in multi-modal systems.

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is a next-generation inference engine designed for world models, using semi-autoregressive decoding to generate coherent, high-quality videos. It focuses on immersive world synthesis rather than high-concurrency scenarios, featuring interactive video streaming, profiling, and LV-Bench integration for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance world models as core simulators for agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming by enabling long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality video generation. Scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception and reasoning, moving beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models.

Method: Uses semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm that combines diffusion and autoregressive methods. Generates video tokens in blocks with diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones. Implements LLM-style KV Cache management for efficient, variable-length generation.

Result: Enables more coherent and stable video sequences compared to standard video diffusion models. Supports efficient benchmarking through LV-Bench integration and provides interactive video streaming with profiling for real-time interaction and realistic simulation of world dynamics.

Conclusion: Inferix represents a dedicated inference engine for world simulation that distinguishes itself from high-concurrency systems and classic video diffusion models. It provides optimized semi-autoregressive decoding for immersive world synthesis and encourages community collaboration to advance world model exploration.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [5] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTED-Ada is a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively switches between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition, with federated learning enhancement for multi-device scenarios to handle dynamic network conditions and frame rate variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource-constrained devices like traffic cameras struggle with fast and accurate video object recognition. While mobile edge computing enables offloading computation-intensive detection to edge servers, the challenge lies in deciding when to use local tracking versus edge detection to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Formulated long-term optimization problems for single and multi-device scenarios, then proposed LTED-Ada using deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select between local tracking and edge detection based on frame rate, accuracy, and delay requirements. Enhanced with federated learning for multi-device collaborative policy training.

Result: Extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a PC edge server demonstrated the superiority of LTED-Ada in handling dynamic conditions and achieving better performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: LTED-Ada effectively addresses the adaptive selection challenge between local tracking and edge detection for video object recognition, with federated learning enabling improved generalization across devices and varying performance requirements.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD is a training-free early-exit framework that accelerates Vision-Language Action models for autonomous driving by terminating inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors, achieving up to 28% sparsity and 29% latency reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Action models suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks, which limits their practical deployment in autonomous driving applications.

Method: Uses action-guided early-exit based on physical feasibility of trajectories rather than confidence scores, with a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on score change rates. Integrates into existing VLA models without retraining.

Result: Achieves up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction on the Bench2Drive benchmark while preserving planning quality and safety.

Conclusion: DeeAD provides an effective training-free acceleration framework for VLA planning models that maintains performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [7] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation Model Distillation (FMD) is introduced as a new paradigm for compressing large self-supervised learning models into compact proxies that retain general-purpose representational power, with Foundry as its first implementation for 3D point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are computationally expensive and impractical for deployment on edge devices like robots and AR/VR headsets, while existing compression techniques sacrifice the crucial generality that makes foundation models valuable.

Method: Foundry trains a student model to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space.

Result: A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks (classification, part segmentation, few-shot scenarios), approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs.

Conclusion: FMD enables practical deployment of foundation models on resource-constrained hardware by creating efficient proxies that preserve general-purpose representational capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [8] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer is a DINOv2-based model that localizes manipulated regions in generative inpainting by using patch embeddings and a linear classification head, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for detecting and localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting, addressing the limitations of existing approaches and leveraging the strong representational power of Vision Transformers.

Method: Builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained on the B-Free dataset, adds a linear classification head to patch embeddings for manipulation prediction at 14x14 resolution, uses sliding-window strategy for larger images, and post-processes heatmaps to refine binary masks.

Result: DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors, achieving 12% higher IoU on average, remains robust to post-processing operations like resizing, noise addition, and JPEG compression, and shows superiority over DINOv3 in ablation studies.

Conclusion: DinoLizer demonstrates the effectiveness of Vision Transformers for manipulation localization in generative inpainting, with strong performance across diverse datasets and robustness to common post-processing, establishing a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [9] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS is a new benchmark for evaluating vision language models' ability to perform tool-based UI design tasks through iterative software interactions, with 598 tasks across 30 UI categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' capacity to collaborate with designers using conventional design software, as no existing benchmarks evaluate tool-based design performance.

Method: Created a benchmark with 598 tool-based design tasks from 3.3K mobile UI designs, including design replication and modification tasks where VLMs update designs step-by-step through context-based tool invocations.

Result: Leading models demonstrate more strategic tool invocations that improve design quality, and common error patterns were identified.

Conclusion: CANVAS provides a foundation for evaluating and enhancing VLMs' tool-based design capabilities, revealing both current strengths and areas for improvement in UI design collaboration.

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [10] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIE is a text-guided semantic image encoder that generates image representations conditioned on text queries, improving VLM performance by 1.3-1.5 points on average across benchmarks while using only half the image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image encoders in VLMs process images agnostically without considering downstream tasks or text queries, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: Proposed Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE) that generates image representations conditioned on input text queries through text-conditioned training.

Result: VLMs with TIE outperform conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at 1B and 3B scales, with gains up to 6 points on DocVQA and InfoVQA. Uses only half as many image tokens, improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: TIE effectively optimizes encoders to capture key visual features, generalizes well with generic queries, and consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

### [11] [LongVT: Incentivizing "Thinking with Long Videos" via Native Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20785)
*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT is an agentic framework that enables multimodal reasoning on long videos through global-to-local processing, using LMMs' temporal grounding as a native cropping tool to iteratively zoom into relevant video segments until answers are visually grounded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models struggle with hallucinations when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed, unlike humans who comprehend long videos by first skimming globally then examining relevant clips.

Method: Uses interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought that exploits LMMs' temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom into specific clips and resample finer-grained frames in a global-to-local reasoning loop.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines across four challenging long-video understanding benchmarks, with training using 247.9K samples for supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K for agentic RL, and 15.4K for agentic fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LongVT provides an effective end-to-end framework for long video reasoning that reduces hallucinations through iterative evidence grounding, with publicly released code, data, and models to advance the field.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight reproduction of KRISP with significantly fewer parameters that achieves 75% of original performance while uncovering design flaws and enabling edge device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational demands and industrial-scale requirements of the original KRISP model by creating a more efficient version suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Lightweight reproduction of KRISP with reduced parameters, systematic ablation studies, evaluation on DAQUAR dataset, and proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data with constrained knowledge graph domain.

Result: The replicated model achieves about 75% of the original KRISP performance while preventing AI hallucinations and enabling operation on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints, demonstrating that lightweight models can maintain reasonable performance while being deployable on edge devices for offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'warping' as a unified operator for dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning, generalizing deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. It provides theoretical analysis of these operators and reveals an asymmetry between forward and backward passes during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify and theoretically analyze various dynamic sampling methods in computer vision that have shown utility but lack unified theoretical understanding.

Method: Developed a novel 'warping' operator that generalizes existing dynamic sampling methods, conducted statistical analysis modeling inputs as IID variables and homogeneous random fields, and introduced a novel loss landscape visualization using gradient update information.

Result: Discovered asymmetry between forward and backward passes in training, identified dynamic sampling as orthogonal to traditional convolution operators, established conditions for stable training, and analyzed discretization effects.

Conclusion: Warping provides a minimal, analyzable implementation of dynamic sampling that unifies existing architectures, with theoretical insights revealing unique training dynamics and enabling stable training of dynamic sampling networks.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF is a modular residual framework for incremental refinement of Neural Radiance Fields that enables efficient updates without catastrophic forgetting, achieving comparable performance to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, which limits their applicability in domains like satellite-based terrain analysis where data arrives sequentially over time.

Method: Proposes a modular residual framework with: (1) residual controller for per-layer corrections into frozen base NeRF, (2) uncertainty-aware gating mechanism to prevent overcorrection, (3) view selection strategy reducing training data by 47%, and (4) knowledge distillation to compress enhanced model to 20% of original size.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42%, outperforms existing baselines with up to 43.5% improvement in PSNR over naive fine-tuning, and surpasses joint training on some metrics.

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF provides an effective solution for incremental NeRF refinement that addresses catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient updates without access to past data, making it suitable for sequential data scenarios like satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) is a novel framework that enhances control in generative video composition by splitting unlabeled videos into foreground/background layers and self-composing them to learn compositional dynamics, addressing data scarcity without annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the data scarcity problem in generative video composition and enhance control over dynamic subject-scene interactions without relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules.

Method: Splits unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them using a transformation-aware training pipeline with multi-layer fusion, augmentation for affordance-aware composition, and identity-preservation loss for foreground fidelity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative benchmarks and human/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: StM provides an effective solution for learning complex compositional dynamics in video generation through self-supervised learning from unlabeled video data.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

### [17] [Training-Free Diffusion Priors for Text-to-Image Generation via Optimization-based Visual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20821)
*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI) as a training-free alternative to diffusion prior networks for text-to-image generation, using iterative optimization and novel constraints to achieve comparable performance without expensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models rely on computationally expensive prior networks that require massive training datasets. The authors challenge whether trained priors are necessary at all.

Method: OVI initializes latent visual representations from random pseudo-tokens and optimizes them iteratively to maximize cosine similarity with text embeddings. Two novel constraints are introduced: Mahalanobis-based loss and Nearest-Neighbor loss to regularize optimization toward realistic image distributions.

Result: Experiments on Kandinsky 2.2 show OVI can replace traditional priors. The analysis reveals flaws in current benchmarks where using text embeddings directly achieves high scores despite poor perceptual quality. Constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity, with Nearest-Neighbor approach achieving scores comparable to state-of-the-art data-efficient priors.

Conclusion: OVI presents a viable training-free alternative to diffusion priors, challenging their necessity and exposing benchmark flaws. The approach merits further investigation as it achieves competitive performance without expensive training requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

*Roman Naeem,David Hagerman,Jennifer Alvén,Fredrik Kahl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr is a 3D image-to-graph model for vascular tree centerline detection that uses recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories with a Producer-Refiner architecture based on Transformer decoder, achieving high recall and comparable precision to SOTA with fewer parameters and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate centerline detection with correct tree topology is critical for clinical applications like diagnosis and surgical navigation, where missing small branches can lead to fatal mistakes due to incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities.

Method: Uses Producer-Refiner architecture with Transformer decoder: Producer proposes initial confluent trajectories, Refiner recurrently refines them to form centerline graph. Confluent trajectory representation enables refinement while enforcing valid tree topology. Includes efficient non-maximum suppression for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches.

Result: Achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA across multiple public centerline datasets, with 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters, faster inference, and substantially fewer parameters.

Conclusion: RefTr demonstrates potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging, offering improved performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-resolution stereo DSLR dataset with 18,000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes to address the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity real stereo datasets for depth estimation research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation research is constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data.

Method: Created a dataset with 18,000 high-resolution (5472×3648px) stereo DSLR images across 9 scenes, capturing images with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations per scene.

Result: The dataset enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for various computer vision tasks including monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: This work bridges the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, revealing challenges with current state-of-the-art methods, and provides a comprehensive dataset to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first large-scale unsupervised dataset for visual memorability using 82,000+ videos with recall descriptions from tip-of-the-tongue queries, enabling better recall generation and retrieval than state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual memorability research is limited by expensive human annotations, restricting dataset diversity and scalability. Existing datasets only provide aggregate scores, missing nuanced memorability signals from natural recall descriptions.

Method: Leveraged tip-of-the-tongue retrieval queries from platforms like Reddit to create unsupervised dataset. Used contrastive training strategy for multimodal ToT retrieval and fine-tuned large vision-language models on the dataset.

Result: Models fine-tuned on the dataset outperform GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions. Created first model capable of multimodal ToT retrieval. Dataset provides rich signals for recall generation and ToT retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The unsupervised dataset and models offer a novel direction for visual content memorability research, facilitating progress by providing scalable, nuanced memorability signals beyond traditional aggregate scoring approaches.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

*Yining Ding,João F. C. Mota,Andrew M. Wallace,Sen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to estimate fog parameters from stereo images using simultaneous optimization, handles locally homogeneous fog, and introduces a new real fog dataset (SDIRF) with calibrated photometric parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fog parameter estimation methods suffer from error propagation due to sequential estimation and cannot handle globally inhomogeneous real-world fog effectively.

Method: Simultaneous estimation of all fog parameters through novel optimization, assuming locally homogeneous fog, and integration as add-on module in SLAM/odometry systems.

Result: Superior performance on both synthetic and real fog data (SDIRF dataset), producing most accurate estimates and better adaptation to real fog conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances visual perception in fog by providing accurate parameter estimation and making code/SDIRF dataset publicly available for community research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 for cross-view object correspondence using two complementary prompt generators (geometry-aware and appearance-guided) with a multi-expert selection mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models like SAM2 struggle with cross-view object correspondence due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations between different perspectives (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric views).

Method: Proposes V^2-SAM framework with: 1) Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor) using DINOv3 features for geometry-aware correspondences, 2) Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) with novel visual prompt matcher for appearance alignment, and 3) Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) for adaptive expert selection.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence) benchmarks.

Conclusion: V^2-SAM successfully adapts SAM2 for cross-view correspondence through complementary prompt generation and adaptive selection, demonstrating superior performance across diverse cross-view scenarios.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Null-TTA is a test-time alignment method that optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance to align diffusion models with target rewards, preventing reward hacking while maintaining cross-reward generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time alignment methods tend to either under-optimize or over-optimize (reward hack) target reward functions, exploiting non-semantic noise patterns rather than achieving meaningful semantic alignment.

Method: Null-TTA optimizes the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. This leverages the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space to ensure alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold.

Result: Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalization, outperforming existing methods that suffer from reward hacking issues.

Conclusion: Semantic-space optimization through unconditional embedding manipulation establishes an effective and principled novel paradigm for test-time alignment that prevents reward hacking while achieving robust alignment.

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their use in dynamic or interactive settings.

Method: The framework combines trainable Gaussian distributions with neural network-based INR. For each image coordinate, it retrieves K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts RGB values through a neural network.

Result: The proposed GaINeR enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation.

Conclusion: GaINeR addresses limitations of traditional INRs by incorporating geometric awareness through Gaussian distributions, making it suitable for dynamic and interactive applications while maintaining high-fidelity image representation capabilities.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model successfully restores standard-dose MRI quality from low-dose (10-30%) contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of cerebellopontine angle cistern, enabling lesion detection and segmentation with significantly reduced contrast agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce contrast agent dose in MRI scans while maintaining diagnostic image quality, particularly for vestibular schwannoma patients in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.

Method: Multi-center retrospective study using T1 and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI to simulate low-dose images, training deep learning models to restore standard-dose quality from reduced-dose inputs, with evaluation of image quality and segmentation performance.

Result: DL restoration improved structural similarity from 0.639 to 0.993 and peak signal-to-noise ratio from 21.6 to 41.4 dB. At 10% dose, segmentation Dice improved from 0.673 to 0.734, with both 10% and 30% doses producing diagnostically useful images.

Conclusion: Deep learning enables lesion detection and diagnostic characterization with only 10-30% of standard contrast agent dose while maintaining excellent image quality.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Conclusion: The smooth regularization technique effectively enhances temporal modeling in video recognition, particularly benefiting lightweight models by enforcing temporal coherence through Gaussian Random Walk modeling of embedding changes.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

### [27] [Open Vocabulary Compositional Explanations for Neuron Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20931)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an open-vocabulary framework for generating compositional explanations of neuron activations in vision models, overcoming limitations of previous methods that relied on human-annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanations for understanding how neurons encode information are limited by their dependence on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts.

Method: The framework uses open-vocabulary semantic segmentation models to generate masks for arbitrary concepts, then derives compositional explanations from these masks through a three-step process: concept specification, mask generation, and explanation derivation.

Result: The framework enables probing neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets, provides more flexible explanations compared to previous methods, and maintains interpretability while expanding applicability beyond predefined domains.

Conclusion: The proposed open-vocabulary framework successfully addresses the limitations of human-annotated datasets in compositional explanations, enabling more flexible and comprehensive analysis of neuron activations in vision models.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

### [28] [UruDendro4: A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Tree-Ring Detection in Cross-Section Images of Pinus taeda L](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20935)
*Henry Marichal,Joaquin Blanco,Diego Passarella,Gregory Randall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UruDendro4, a dataset of 102 Pinus taeda L. cross-section images with manual annual ring annotations, enabling volumetric growth modeling and automated ring detection using state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual measurement of tree-ring growth is time-consuming and imprecise, and there is scarcity of wood cross-section data for developing automated algorithms.

Method: Created UruDendro4 dataset with samples from multiple stem heights, performed baseline evaluation using DeepCS-TRD method, conducted ablation experiments, and demonstrated improved generalization through training with the dataset.

Result: DeepCS-TRD achieved best performance with mAP of 0.838, mAR of 0.782, and ARE score of 0.084. Training with the dataset improved model generalization for tree-ring detection.

Conclusion: UruDendro4 enables volumetric modeling of annual growth and provides a valuable resource for developing automated tree-ring detection methods, with demonstrated performance improvements through dataset inclusion.

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

*Rawa Mohammed,Mina Attin,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BUSTR is a multitask vision-language framework for generating breast ultrasound reports without paired image-report supervision, using structured descriptors and radiomics features with improved clinical efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in automated radiology report generation for breast ultrasound, including lack of paired datasets and hallucination risks from large language models.

Method: Constructs reports from structured descriptors (BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features; uses multi-head Swin encoder with multitask loss and dual-level objective combining token-level cross-entropy with cosine-similarity alignment loss.

Result: Consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics across two public BUS datasets (BrEaST and BUS-BRA), particularly for key targets like BI-RADS category and pathology.

Conclusion: Descriptor-aware vision model trained with combined token-level and alignment loss improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

### [30] [Beyond Realism: Learning the Art of Expressive Composition with StickerNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20957)
*Haoming Lu,David Kocharian,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StickerNet is a two-stage framework for expressive image composition that predicts placement parameters (opacity, mask, location, scale) based on composition type, trained on real-world editing data from an online platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image composition focuses on realism, but modern content creation often prioritizes artistic, playful, and socially engaging compositions that don't preserve realism. This work addresses the gap in supporting expressive, user-driven editing behaviors.

Method: Two-stage framework: first determines composition type, then predicts placement parameters. Dataset built from 1.8 million real editing actions from an online platform, capturing authentic user-community validated placement decisions.

Result: StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior in user studies and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness despite task ambiguity.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism, showing the value of learning from real-world editing patterns.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

### [31] [TrafficLens: Multi-Camera Traffic Video Analysis Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20965)
*Md Adnan Arefeen,Biplob Debnath,Srimat Chakradhar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrafficLens is a novel algorithm that accelerates multi-camera traffic video analysis by using sequential VLM processing with overlapping camera coverage and object-level similarity detection, achieving 4x faster video-to-text conversion while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches using LLMs with RAG systems for traffic video analysis require converting video to text via VLMs, which is time-consuming and delays timely insights from traffic camera feeds at intersections.

Method: TrafficLens uses a sequential approach leveraging overlapping camera coverage areas, iteratively applying VLMs with varying token limits using previous outputs as prompts, and intelligently bypassing redundant VLM invocations through object-level similarity detection.

Result: Experimental results show TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to 4x while maintaining information accuracy compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: TrafficLens provides an efficient solution for multi-camera traffic intersection analysis, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions from video feeds while significantly reducing processing delays.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

### [32] [Privacy-Preserving Federated Vision Transformer Learning Leveraging Lightweight Homomorphic Encryption in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20983)
*Al Amin,Kamrul Hasan,Liang Hong,Sharif Ullah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers with homomorphic encryption for secure medical image classification, achieving 30x communication reduction while preventing model inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare institutions need collaborative machine learning but face privacy regulations like HIPAA that prohibit direct data sharing. While federated learning enables decentralized training, conventional FL gradients remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose sensitive medical information.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE), using ViT CLS token as compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation. Encrypts CLS tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to server.

Result: Encrypting CLS tokens achieves 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption. Prevents model inversion attacks (gradients were highly vulnerable: PSNR 52.26 dB, SSIM 0.999, NMI 0.741). Framework requires only 326 KB encrypted data per aggregation round. Achieves 96.12% global accuracy unencrypted and 90.02% encrypted.

Conclusion: The proposed CLS-protected HE approach provides strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high classification accuracy, enabling secure multi-institutional collaboration for medical diagnosis without exposing sensitive patient data.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

### [33] [Inversion-Free Style Transfer with Dual Rectified Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20986)
*Yingying Deng,Xiangyu He,Fan Tang,Weiming Dong,Xucheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An inversion-free style transfer framework using dual rectified flows that avoids computationally expensive inversion processes by only using forward passes, achieving efficient and high-quality style transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing diffusion-based style transfer methods that rely on computationally intensive inversion processes, which compromise efficiency and can cause visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate.

Method: Uses dual rectified flows to predict content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. Includes attention injection to guide style integration.

Result: The method demonstrates generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer with enhanced visual fidelity and content preservation.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free framework based on dual rectified flows offers a robust and efficient solution for style transfer, avoiding the shortcomings of traditional inversion-based methods while maintaining high visual quality.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

### [34] [RefOnce: Distilling References into a Prototype Memory for Referring Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20989)
*Yu-Huan Wu,Zi-Xuan Zhu,Yan Wang,Liangli Zhen,Deng-Ping Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Ref-COD framework that distills reference images into class prototypes during training, eliminating the need for reference images at test time through query-conditioned prototype mixing and bidirectional attention alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ref-COD systems require reference images during testing, which limits deployability, adds latency, and increases data collection burden. The goal is to create a more efficient system that doesn't need references at inference time.

Method: Maintains EMA-updated prototypes per category during training, predicts mixture weights from the query to synthesize reference vectors at inference, and uses bidirectional attention alignment to bridge representation gaps between reference statistics and camouflaged query features.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on the R2C7K benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods, while eliminating the need for test-time references.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a simple, efficient solution for Ref-COD that doesn't require mandatory references at test time, improving deployability and reducing latency.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

TL;DR: WavePCNet is a physics-driven neural network that enhances obscured object localization and segmentation by simulating wavefront propagation, incorporating complex amplitude transfer operators and momentum memory to suppress perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture coherent light propagation physics and converge to non-physical solutions under low signal-to-noise conditions, compromising observation stability and reliability.

Method: Proposes WavePCNet with Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection for precise coherent propagation constraints, momentum memory mechanism for perturbation suppression, and High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement for multi-scale receptive fields and structural consistency modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on four physically collected datasets show WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: WavePCNet effectively addresses challenges in obscured object perception through physics-driven wavefront propagation simulation and perturbation suppression mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

TL;DR: GuardTrace-VL is a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors multimodal reasoning models' full Question-Thinking-Answer pipeline to detect unsafe content in intermediate reasoning traces, achieving 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal safety guards only evaluate input questions and final answers, neglecting unsafe content that can emerge during intermediate reasoning processes, creating deployment risks even when final answers appear non-harmful.

Method: Introduces GuardTrace-VL with joint image-text analysis, constructs GuardTrace dataset through diverse prompting strategies and MLRM-human voting pipeline, and uses three-stage progressive training with data refinement to learn context-dependent safety preferences.

Result: Achieves 93.1% F1 score on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing 13.5% improvement over previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain test scenarios.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL effectively addresses the critical gap in multimodal safety by monitoring full reasoning pipelines, significantly improving detection of unsafe content that emerges during intermediate reasoning stages.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, providing an effective solution for image decomposition that enables flexible content editing through layered representations.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity.

TL;DR: MERGE is a novel Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented Generation framework for news image captioning that addresses incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding through an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base and enhanced retrieval mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing news image captioning methods struggle with three key challenges: incomplete information coverage, weak cross-modal alignment between visual content and textual context, and suboptimal visual-entity grounding.

Method: MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) integrating textual, visual, and structured knowledge. It uses a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy for cross-modal alignment and dynamic retrieval guided by image content for visual-entity matching.

Result: Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show significant improvements: CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset with +20.17 CIDEr and +6.22 F1-score.

Conclusion: MERGE demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in news image captioning, showing strong robustness and domain adaptability through its entity-aware retrieval-augmented generation approach.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaRank is a meta-learning framework that automatically selects the most appropriate Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) metric for transfer learning tasks by learning relationships between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTE metric selection is ad hoc or based on average historical performance, but no single metric works optimally across all target datasets. The effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent.

Method: Formulate metric selection as learning-to-rank problem. Encode textual descriptions of datasets and MTE metrics using pretrained language model into shared semantic space. Train meta-predictor offline on diverse meta-tasks with listwise objective to prioritize correct ranking of top-performing metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate strong effectiveness of MetaRank in automatically selecting appropriate MTE metrics.

Conclusion: MetaRank provides an efficient, task-aware approach for automatic MTE metric selection that outperforms ad hoc selection methods, enabling practitioners to choose the most appropriate metric for new target datasets.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel trustworthy multi-view classification framework using prototypes to represent neighbor structures, enabling efficient cross-view consensus discovery and dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TMVC methods rely on globally dense neighbor relationships leading to high computational costs and inability to ensure consistency across inter-view relationships, with manual weight assignment lacking guarantees for learned neighbor structure consistency.

Method: Introduces prototypes to represent neighbor structures of each view, simplifying intra-view neighbor relation learning and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structures for efficient cross-view consensus discovery.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing TMVC approaches by providing more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus through prototype-based neighbor structure representation.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus.

*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CameraMaster is a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching that explicitly decouples camera directives and integrates parameter embeddings to achieve precise camera control with monotonic parameter responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided diffusion models struggle with physically consistent image retouching using precise camera parameters. Current methods either rely on ambiguous text prompts that hinder precise control, or use separate training approaches that compromise scalability and multi-parameter composition.

Method: CameraMaster decouples camera directives and integrates two information streams: directive representation capturing photographer's intent and parameter embedding encoding camera settings. It modulates both directive and content semantics with camera parameters, injects modulated directive via cross-attention, and uses directive/camera embeddings as conditioning signals throughout the denoising process.

Result: Extensive experiments show CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: CameraMaster provides a unified framework for precise camera-aware image retouching that achieves tight semantic-parameter alignment and superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

*Shijia Yang,Yunong Liu,Bohan Zhai,Ximeng Sun,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum,Manling Li,Chenfeng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaptionQA is a utility-based benchmark that evaluates image captions by measuring how well they support downstream tasks across 4 domains, using 33,027 multiple-choice questions to test if captions preserve visual information usable by LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current caption evaluation practices fail to assess whether captions can effectively substitute for images in real downstream applications like retrieval, recommendation, and agentic systems.

Method: Built a domain-dependent benchmark covering Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI domains with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level, 69 subcategories). Created 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions requiring visual information, then used LLMs to answer questions using captions alone to measure caption utility.

Result: Evaluation revealed substantial gaps between image and caption utility, with models performing nearly identically on traditional image-QA benchmarks but showing up to 32% performance drop in caption utility.

Conclusion: CaptionQA provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating caption utility in downstream tasks, exposing significant limitations in current captioning models that traditional metrics fail to capture.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

TL;DR: FlowerDance is an efficient music-to-dance generation method that combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints and uses a BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion to achieve high-quality motion generation with fast inference speed and low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing music-to-dance generation methods have limited generation efficiency, which constrains high-fidelity 3D rendering and expressiveness of 3D characters in real-world applications.

Method: Combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints for high-quality motion with few sampling steps, uses BiMamba-based backbone with Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, and employs efficient non-autoregressive generation. Also supports motion editing for interactive refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on AIST++ and FineDance datasets in both motion quality and generation efficiency, with significant improvements in inference speed and memory utilization.

Conclusion: FlowerDance provides an efficient solution for music-to-dance generation that enables high-quality motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness while maintaining computational efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: LungNoduleAgent is a collaborative multi-agent system that improves lung nodule diagnosis by dividing the process into three specialized modules: nodule detection, CT report generation, and malignancy assessment using medical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with accurate nodule morphology description and medical expertise integration, limiting their clinical reliability. Multi-agent systems offer potential for balancing generality and precision in medical applications.

Method: Three-module system: Nodule Spotter coordinates detection models to identify nodules; Radiologist uses localized image description for CT reports; Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning using images, reports, pathology knowledge base, and multi-agent framework.

Result: Outperforms mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and expert models on two private datasets and LIDC-IDRI dataset. Demonstrates importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration.

Conclusion: LungNoduleAgent is a promising foundational tool for clinical lung nodule analysis, highlighting the value of specialized multi-agent collaboration in medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

### [45] [PG-ControlNet: A Physics-Guided ControlNet for Generative Spatially Varying Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21043)
*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework that combines generative models with physical constraints for spatially varying image deblurring, using dense degradation field modeling and ControlNet to bridge the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based deblurring methods face limitations: model-based approaches produce over-smoothed results with artifacts, while generative models hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. There's a need to reconcile these paradigms for better deblurring performance.

Method: Models degradation as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels to capture minute variations, and leverages this descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture that strongly guides the diffusion sampling process.

Result: The method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods and generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully reconciles generative models with explicit physical constraints, achieving superior deblurring performance by combining the strengths of both paradigms while mitigating their respective weaknesses.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

TL;DR: MUSE is a unified framework for emotional image generation and editing that uses test-time scaling with an off-the-shelf emotion classifier, optimizing emotional tokens through gradient-based methods and semantic similarity timing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Image Emotional Synthesis approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling.

Method: MUSE uses test-time scaling strategy with an off-the-shelf emotion classifier, addressing three key questions: HOW to guide synthesis via gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens, WHEN to introduce guidance using semantic similarity timing, and WHICH emotion to guide via multi-emotion loss to reduce interference.

Result: Experimental results show MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining optimal balance between content, text prompt adherence, and realistic emotional expression.

Conclusion: MUSE establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis by unifying generation and editing tasks without requiring additional diffusion model updates or specialized emotional datasets.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AD predictions face challenges in maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data, as time-related aspects of distribution reflect changes in disease characteristics.

Method: T-NIG model employs brain images from two time points to create intermediate and future images, using coordinate neighborhoods for feature identification and incorporating time parameters into normal inverse gamma distribution to understand feature changes in brain imaging sequences with varying time intervals.

Result: T-NIG demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks, proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics even with irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: The T-NIG model effectively addresses the challenge of irregular time intervals in AD prediction through temporal parameter estimation in Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution, achieving superior performance in maintaining disease characteristics during long-term forecasting.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

TL;DR: MIRA is a lightweight multimodal reasoning agent that improves instruction-guided image editing by using an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop to handle complex instructions more accurately than standard diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based editing models often fail to accurately interpret complex user instructions involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to semantically drifted edits that don't reflect intended changes.

Method: Proposes MIRA, a plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through iterative perception-reasoning-action loops, predicting atomic edit instructions step by step using visual feedback. Uses a 150K multimodal tool-use dataset (MIRA-Editing) and two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline.

Result: When paired with open-source image editing models (Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, Qwen-Image-Edit), MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems like GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively addresses the limitations of current diffusion-based editing models by simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes, enabling more accurate interpretation and execution of complex editing instructions.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: A novel iris authentication pipeline using 3D-CNN to capture spatio-spatial-temporal features from iris sequences, trained with curriculum learning and triplet/ArcFace loss for robust recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iris authentication methods lack robustness to variations (rotation, scale, reflections, blur) and fail to effectively leverage spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns, relying on simple point-to-point comparisons.

Method: Split iris images into sequences of sub-images, process with 3D-CNN to capture spatial-temporal features, train end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in curriculum manner to embed temporal dependencies.

Result: The approach learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations that improve discriminability in deep metric space, enhancing robustness to rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication by effectively modeling spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics through curriculum learning and 3D-CNN processing.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide reliable perception in adverse conditions, but existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific, preventing transfer across tasks. Foundation models have transformed visual/language understanding but remain underexplored for radar sensing.

Method: Uses structured caption framework encoding vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates and hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity. Leverages CARLA simulator for large-scale annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios.

Result: Proposes localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures. The model learns unified representations enabling transfer across radar perception tasks.

Conclusion: RadarFM provides a foundation model approach for radar sensing that overcomes fragmentation in existing methods and enables cross-task transfer through unified scene-level representations.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

TL;DR: EM-KD is a knowledge distillation method for Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models that addresses vision token imbalance between teacher and student models through spatial alignment and introduces two distillation strategies for enhanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing efficient MLLMs compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption but lose visual information, and prior knowledge distillation methods overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between student and teacher models.

Method: Proposes EM-KD with: 1) Manhattan distance calculation and Hungarian matching for spatial alignment of unbalanced vision tokens, 2) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) using smooth L1 distance on affinity matrices, and 3) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD) using reverse KL divergence on aligned vision logits.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows EM-KD trained models outperform prior Efficient MLLMs significantly on both accuracy and efficiency, and achieves better performance than previous distillation methods when equipped with the proposed vision token matching strategy.

Conclusion: EM-KD effectively enhances Efficient MLLMs through knowledge distillation by addressing vision token imbalance and implementing novel distillation strategies, demonstrating superior performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: AnchorOPT introduces dynamic anchor-based prompt learning for CLIP models, replacing static textual anchors with learnable task-specific anchors and adaptive positional relationships between anchors and soft tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods use static textual tokens as anchors that lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility, limiting CLIP model generalization capabilities.

Method: A two-stage training approach: first learning dynamic anchor tokens from task-specific data, then freezing them and optimizing soft tokens and a learnable position matrix that adapts based on training stage and task context.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorOPT achieves performance comparable to or exceeding methods with additional learnable modules or regularization techniques, while being a plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT provides a simple yet effective dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework that improves CLIP generalization through task-adaptive anchors and positional relationships, delivering consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: FaithFusion is a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework that uses pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG) to maintain geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts in driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face challenges in effectively fusing geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models, leading to over-restoration and geometric drift due to the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria.

Method: Introduces Expected Information Gain (EIG) as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, and uses pixel-level weighting to distill edits back into 3DGS. The system is plug-and-play without extra prior conditions or structural modifications.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo dataset across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID metrics, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

Conclusion: FaithFusion effectively addresses the fusion challenges between 3DGS and diffusion models through EIG-driven synthesis, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining geometric fidelity while enabling plausible appearance synthesis under large viewpoint changes.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how visual distractors affect test-time scaling in vision-language models, revealing that visual distractors reduce accuracy without increasing reasoning length, unlike textual distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if visual distractors cause inverse scaling effects similar to those observed in language models, where distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning.

Method: Introduced Idis dataset with systematic visual distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions; analyzed reasoning traces and attribute counts; tested on Waterbirds benchmark; proposed prompting strategy to mitigate bias.

Result: Visual distractors cause inverse scaling but reduce accuracy without increasing reasoning length; attribute tracking in reasoning traces reveals interaction patterns; trends extend to established bias benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual distractors fundamentally differ from textual ones in their impact on reasoning; simple prompting strategies can help mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

*Xin Honga,Jie Lin,Minghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN) is proposed for early Alzheimer's disease prediction by learning morphological changes in brain MRI sequences and generating future images that follow disease progression patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to slow its progression, and current methods rely on manual feature extraction from brain images. There's a need for automated methods that can handle missing temporal data and learn morphological changes for accurate prediction.

Method: DATGN first interpolates incomplete MRI sequences, then uses a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRI images that follow disease progression patterns, enabling early Alzheimer's disease prediction.

Result: DATGN achieved competitive PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics on the ADNI dataset. When synthetic data was used with classification methods, accuracy improved significantly: 6.21% to 16% for AD vs. NC classification, and 7.34% to 21.25% for AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification.

Conclusion: DATGN successfully generates MRI images consistent with Alzheimer's disease brain atrophy trends, enabling early disease prediction and significantly improving classification accuracy when used as synthetic training data.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

*Changlin Li,Jiawei Zhang,Zeyi Shi,Zongxin Yang,Zhihui Li,Xiaojun Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EntPruner is an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models that reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining generation quality through block-level importance assessment and adaptive pruning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale vision generative models like diffusion and flow models show significant parameter redundancy when transferred to downstream tasks, requiring efficient pruning methods that preserve output diversity and condition-fidelity.

Method: Introduces entropy-guided pruning using Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) to assess block importance, and a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework that dynamically determines when and how much to prune during training to avoid mode collapse.

Result: Achieves up to 2.22× inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets using DiT and SiT models.

Conclusion: EntPruner effectively reduces parameter redundancy in generative models through entropy-guided progressive pruning, balancing computational efficiency with preservation of generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

### [57] [DeepRFTv2: Kernel-level Learning for Image Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21132)
*Xintian Mao,Haofei Song,Yin-Nian Liu,Qingli Li,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) that enables deep networks to learn blur processes at kernel-level rather than pixel-level, improving deblurring performance by converting spatial convolution to Fourier multiplication and using feature-level convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep networks only perform pixel-level restoration and fail to understand the essence of blur, which is fundamentally a kernel-level convolution process. The authors aim to enable networks to learn the blur process at kernel-level for better deblurring performance.

Method: Propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) that performs activation in Fourier space to convert spatial convolution to multiplication, uses feature-level convolution instead of image-level, and employs a decoupled multi-scale architecture with reversible sub-unets for efficient feature extraction.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art motion deblurring results, with the kernel estimator learning physically meaningful kernels and demonstrating potential for other kernel-related problems.

Conclusion: The proposed FKE method successfully enables networks to learn blur processes at kernel-level, achieving superior deblurring performance while maintaining low complexity and requiring no additional supervision.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Conclusion: Ent-Prog provides an effective framework for efficient training of diffusion models for human video generation, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining model quality.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation methods for static images and text are insufficient for capturing complex temporal dynamics in video generation, creating critical safety challenges in T2V models.

Method: TEAR uses a temporal-aware test generator with two-stage optimization (initial training and temporal-aware online preference learning) to create textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics, plus a refine model for cyclical improvement of prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness.

Result: TEAR achieves over 80% attack success rate across open-source and commercial T2V systems, significantly outperforming prior best result of 57%.

Conclusion: TEAR effectively uncovers safety risks in T2V models by targeting temporal dynamics, demonstrating the need for specialized safety evaluation methods for video generation systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

TL;DR: LLaVA-UHD v3 introduces Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) to enable efficient native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, reducing computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of global native-resolution visual encoding in MLLMs, which enhances capability but comes with significant computational overhead.

Method: Proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) with two modules: refined patch embedding for flexible patch-size scaling, and windowed token compression hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations.

Result: ViT-UHD achieves competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT by 2.4x, and LLaVA-UHD v3 achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Conclusion: PVC enables efficient native-resolution encoding in MLLMs, significantly reducing computational overhead while preserving model performance, offering a promising approach for future efficient MLLM research.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

*Joonhyung Park,Hyeongwon Jang,Joowon Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GridAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual autoregressive models that uses grid-partitioned progressive generation with early pruning and layout-specified prompt reformulation to improve text-to-image generation quality while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling strategies like Best-of-N are suboptimal for visual AR models because they consume full computation on erroneous trajectories and lack a blueprint of the entire canvas due to raster-scan decoding, limiting scaling benefits.

Method: GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme where multiple partial candidates are generated for each position, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones become anchors to guide subsequent decoding. It also uses layout-specified prompt reformulation that inspects partial views to infer feasible layouts.

Result: With N=4, GridAR outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also shows comparable edit quality and 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: GridAR effectively addresses the blueprint deficiency in visual AR models and achieves higher-quality results with limited test-time scaling, demonstrating strong performance in both text-to-image generation and image editing tasks.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Result: Achieves remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning tasks.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D provides a compact, unified architecture for fine-grained, general-purpose 3D vision-language modeling that effectively bridges language reasoning with 3D spatial understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing patches overfit to single models and fail in black-box settings. There's a need for universal, transferable attacks that work across unknown architectures and real-world conditions.

Method: UPA-RFAS combines: (1) feature-space objective with ℓ1 deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss for transferable representation shifts, (2) robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure with inner loop for invisible perturbations and outer loop for universal patch optimization, (3) VLA-specific losses including Patch Attention Dominance and Patch Semantic Misalignment.

Result: Experiments show UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across diverse VLA models, manipulation tasks, and physical executions, working effectively across different models, tasks, and viewpoints.

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS exposes a practical patch-based attack surface for VLA-driven robots and establishes a strong baseline for future defense mechanisms against universal adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt pre-trained foundation models for domain-specific ecological knowledge without expensive retraining, enabling effective representation learning in data-scarce biodiversity settings.

Method: BotaCLIP uses contrastive learning to align high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés, incorporating regularization to prevent catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge.

Result: BotaCLIP embeddings consistently outperformed DOFA and supervised baselines across three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

Conclusion: Domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can effectively inject expert knowledge into data-scarce ecological applications, enabling frugal and transferable representation learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Motivation: Existing deep clustering methods suffer from a disparity between well-structured local features and poorly separated global features, where local structures show strong consistency but global features have intertwined boundaries.

Method: The method first identifies high-confidence samples using adaptive k-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering to select trustworthy anchors, then uses these samples to compute a discriminative loss that promotes intra-class compactness and inter-class separability for network optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show DCBoost significantly improves clustering performance of various deep clustering models, boosting state-of-the-art baselines like ProPos by over 3% and amplifying silhouette coefficient by over 7x.

Conclusion: DCBoost effectively bridges the gap between local and global feature structures in deep clustering, providing a parameter-free solution that consistently enhances clustering performance across diverse models and datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

TL;DR: ConFu is a multimodal learning framework that jointly embeds individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, capturing both pairwise relationships and higher-order dependencies through contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods mainly focus on pairwise alignment between two modalities, often overlooking higher-order interactions or failing to preserve pairwise relationships, which limits their effectiveness on single-modality tasks.

Method: ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term that aligns modality pairs with a third modality, enabling capture of higher-order dependencies while maintaining pairwise correspondence.

Result: ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks across synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, effectively exploiting cross-modal complementarity and scaling with increasing multimodal complexity.

Conclusion: ConFu provides a unified contrastive framework that supports both one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval while capturing higher-order dependencies that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ART framework for fine-grained action recognition using query-response mechanism to track distinctive local details, with region-specific semantic activation and multi-level contrastive constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle with subtle local details that distinguish similar fine-grained actions.

Method: Proposes Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework with region-specific semantic activation module using text-constrained queries from VLMs, organizing responses into action tracklets with multi-level contrastive constraints and task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on action recognition benchmarks demonstrate superiority over previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The ART framework effectively discovers and tracks distinctive local details for fine-grained action recognition, outperforming existing methods through its query-response mechanism and multi-level optimization.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

*Munish Rathee,Boris Bačić,Maryam Doborjeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIFT-SNN framework combines SIFT feature extraction with Spiking Neural Networks for real-time structural anomaly detection in transport infrastructure, achieving 92.3% accuracy with 9.5ms latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-latency, low-power real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure that preserves spatial feature grounding and supports transparent decision-making, unlike conventional CNN approaches.

Method: Hybrid pipeline integrating Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with latency-driven spike conversion and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network for classification.

Result: Achieved 92.3% classification accuracy (±0.8%) with per-frame inference time of 9.5ms and sparse spike activity (8.1%), enabling real-time edge deployment on consumer-grade hardware.

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN framework enables efficient, interpretable real-time structural safety monitoring with validated prototype deployment, though generalization to unseen field conditions requires further validation.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

TL;DR: Comparative study of DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow generative models showing CFM outperforms DDPM (FID 24.15 vs 402.98) and MeanFlow enables 50X faster single-step generation (FID 29.15). CFM extended to image inpainting with significant quality improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively compare three generative modeling paradigms - DDPM, CFM, and MeanFlow - focusing on their sampling efficiency and performance, and to extend CFM for image inpainting applications.

Method: Implemented all three methods using unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10. Extended CFM to image inpainting with mask-guided sampling using four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half) and fine-tuned for inpainting-aware training.

Result: CFM achieved FID 24.15 with 50 steps vs DDPM's 402.98. MeanFlow achieved FID 29.15 with single-step sampling (50X inference speedup). Inpainting model improved PSNR from 4.95 to 8.57 dB (+73%) and SSIM from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%) on center masks.

Conclusion: CFM significantly outperforms DDPM in generation quality, while MeanFlow offers dramatic inference speed improvements. Fine-tuned inpainting models demonstrate substantial quality gains, validating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training approaches.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monet is a training framework that enables multimodal LLMs to reason directly in latent visual space using continuous embeddings as intermediate visual thoughts, addressing computational costs and supervision issues through a three-stage SFT pipeline and proposing VLPO for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual reasoning methods lack human-like abstract visual thinking due to limitations of external tools, motivating the need for direct reasoning in latent visual space.

Method: Three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning pipeline with VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning, using Monet-SFT-125K dataset containing 125K text-image interleaved CoTs.

Result: Monet-7B shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables direct latent visual reasoning, with empirical analysis of training components and insights from early unsuccessful attempts provided for future development.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

*Chen Ling,Henglin Shi,Hedvig Kjellström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIELDS is a 3D face reconstruction method that captures subtle emotional details by combining 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression supervision and emotion recognition, using authentic 4D facial scan data to bridge the 2D/3D domain gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth, failing to capture the emotional information conveyed through facial expressions.

Method: Extends self-supervised 2D image consistency with direct 3D expression parameter supervision from spontaneous 4D facial scans, plus an auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss to prevent exaggeration.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues, yielding emotion-rich face models with realistic expressions from single images, significantly improving facial expression recognition performance.

Conclusion: The dual-supervision strategy effectively bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, enabling accurate capture of genuine emotion content in 3D face reconstruction without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper extends Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) to complex-valued neural networks, introducing a projection layer from complex to real space before Gumbel Softmax to achieve shift equivariance and invariance in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNNs lack shift equivariance and invariance due to downsampling/upsampling operations. While data augmentation helps empirically, a systematic theoretical approach is needed to guarantee these properties by construction.

Method: Extends LPS to complex-valued networks with a novel projection layer from ℂ to ℝ before Gumbel Softmax, applied to polarimetric SAR images for classification, reconstruction, and semantic segmentation tasks.

Result: The extended LPS method is evaluated on various computer vision problems, demonstrating improved shift invariance in classification tasks and shift equivariance in reconstruction and semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: The extension of LPS to complex-valued networks with the proposed projection layer successfully achieves theoretically guaranteed shift equivariance and invariance properties in computer vision applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Method: Proposed a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework integrating proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation, creating AVFakeBench with 12K audio-video questions covering 7 forgery types and 4 annotation levels.

Result: Evaluation of 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models and 2 detection methods revealed that AV-LMMs show potential as emerging forgery detectors but have notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: AVFakeBench establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for audio-video forgery detection, demonstrating the need for improved fine-grained perception and reasoning in AV-LMMs to handle diverse real-world forgery scenarios.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

*Futian Wang,Mengqi Wang,Xiao Wang,Haowen Wang,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel remote sensing change captioning method that uses the SAM foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for remote sensing change captioning have weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment, which this work aims to address.

Method: The method employs CNN/Transformer for global features, SAM for semantic/motion change regions, a knowledge graph for object information, and fuses these via cross-attention with a Transformer decoder.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses region awareness and temporal alignment issues in remote sensing change captioning through SAM integration and heterogeneous information fusion.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaGen is the first framework for autoregressive long-horizon LiDAR scene generation, enabling frame-by-frame generation from single-frame input using bounding box conditions, with modules to enhance interactivity and reduce error accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR generation methods only support single frame generation, while prediction approaches require multiple historical frames and lack interactivity, failing to support long-horizon interactive generation needed for autonomous driving.

Method: LaGen uses a single-frame LiDAR input with bounding box conditions, features a scene decoupling estimation module for object-level interactivity, and a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation.

Result: Experimental results show LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, particularly on later frames, demonstrating superior performance in long-horizon scene generation.

Conclusion: LaGen successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling interactive, frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes, advancing generative world models for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

*Juncheng Chen,Chao Xu,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS is a framework that corrects 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) geometric inaccuracies to generate precise correspondence labels for training robust, zero-shot image matchers, achieving up to 17.7% performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based image matching requires large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. While 3DGS enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering prevent robust correspondence labeling.

Method: Two-fold approach: (1) geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce precise correspondence labels, and (2) 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into 2D matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations.

Result: Generated ground-truth correspondences reduce epipolar error by up to 40x compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals. State-of-the-art matchers trained on this data achieve up to 17.7% zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: With proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source for training robust zero-shot image matchers, paving the way for next-generation matching systems.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras produce spatially sparse but temporally dense data, and existing representation learning methods struggle with undersampling due to spatial sparsity.

Method: Proposes hypergraph-based completion mechanism that connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations, supports multi-modal fusion with RGB tokens, and uses self-attention for temporal aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The hypergraph-guided approach successfully addresses event stream sparsity and enables effective multi-modal feature learning and fusion.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Conclusion: RSCoVLM serves as an effective baseline that promotes progress toward general-purpose RS models through its flexible architecture and comprehensive solutions for RS multi-task learning challenges.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Conclusion: The hybrid PathMamba architecture successfully combines the complementary strengths of Mamba and Transformers, setting new benchmarks in road segmentation accuracy and topological continuity without prohibitive computational costs.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers face quadratic computational complexity with token length, and existing token reduction methods overlook frequency characteristics of self-attention like rank collapsing and over-smoothing.

Method: Partition tokens into high-frequency and low-frequency tokens, selectively preserve high-frequency tokens, and aggregate low-frequency tokens into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over-smoothing through extensive experiments and analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-aware token reduction strategy effectively addresses computational efficiency issues in Vision Transformers while preserving performance by considering frequency characteristics, and provides insights into limitations of previous methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaliTex introduces geometry-calibrated attention to solve cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation by enforcing spatial alignment and geometry-conditioned appearance routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D texture generation systems suffer from cross-view inconsistency due to attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention causes geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling.

Method: Introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention for spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention for routing appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways. Uses a two-stage diffusion transformer.

Result: Empirically produces seamless and view-consistent textures, outperforming both open-source and commercial baselines.

Conclusion: CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization, effectively addressing cross-view inconsistency in 3D texture generation.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Merge-and-Bound (M&B) is a novel Class Incremental Learning approach that manipulates model weights through inter-task and intra-task merging, combined with bounded updates to minimize catastrophic forgetting while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental Learning by directly optimizing model weights in parameter space through reliable merging techniques, enabling effective learning of new tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones.

Method: Uses two types of weight merging: inter-task merging (averaging weights from all previous stages) and intra-task merging (combining parameters within current stage). Implements bounded update technique to optimize target model with minimal cumulative updates while preserving previous knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on standard CIL benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing effective reduction of catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: M&B provides an effective approach for Class Incremental Learning that can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods without architectural changes, achieving better performance through parameter space manipulation and bounded updates.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [85] [HTTM: Head-wise Temporal Token Merging for Faster VGGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21317)
*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTTM is a training-free 3D token merging method that accelerates VGGT by merging tokens at multi-head granularity, preserving feature uniqueness and leveraging spatial-temporal correlations for up to 7x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT's joint inference of 3D attributes requires global attention layers that cause significant latency bottlenecks for large scenes with long-sequence inputs, necessitating efficient acceleration methods.

Method: Head-wise temporal merging (HTTM) merges tokens in multi-head granularity rather than uniformly across attention heads, preserving feature uniqueness after head concatenation and leveraging spatial locality and temporal correspondence at head level.

Result: HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in GPU-based inference, outperforming existing merging techniques that cause identical tokens and hinder representational ability.

Conclusion: HTTM provides an effective training-free solution for accelerating VGGT by preserving feature diversity through multi-head granular merging while achieving high merging ratios with low computational costs.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

*Xiang Gu,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Anan Du,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRPD is a teacher-student framework that uses multimodal knowledge distillation with confidence-gated mechanism to create robust 3D point cloud models against adversarial attacks, achieving state-of-the-art defense performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for 3D point cloud models suffer from high computational overhead and poor generalization across different attack types, creating reliability issues in security-sensitive applications.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) framework that learns lightweight prompts by aligning student model features with robust embeddings from three teachers: vision model (depth projections), high-performance 3D model, and text encoder, guided by confidence-gated mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while achieving better performance on clean data with no additional inference cost.

Conclusion: MRPD presents a practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge through training-stage distillation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel feature extraction method for robust normal estimation in point clouds using multi-scale feature fusion to address patch size selection issues, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with selecting appropriate neighborhood sizes for different data/geometries and have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds.

Method: Proposes patch feature fitting (PFF) using multi-scale feature fusion through feature aggregation (progressively aggregates patch features from different scales) and cross-scale feature compensation (ensures reusability of features from earlier layers).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and reduced running time.

Conclusion: The multi-scale feature aggregation and compensation strategy enables scale adaptation for varying local patches and delivers optimal feature descriptions for robust normal estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-G²T is a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for 4D Gaussian splatting that addresses view-dependent effects in endoscopic videos through monocular depth supervision, temporal embedding, and keyframe-constrained streaming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic videos exhibit strong view-dependent effects like specularities and occlusions, causing pure photometric supervision to misalign with geometry and trigger early geometric drift, making erroneous shapes hard to correct during densification.

Method: Three main components: 1) Geo-guided prior distillation using confidence-gated monocular depth with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses; 2) Time-embedded Gaussian field with rotor-like rotation parameterization for temporal coherence; 3) Keyframe-constrained streaming with max-points budget for efficiency and stability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Conclusion: Endo-G²T successfully anchors geometry early in 4D Gaussian splatting while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes through its geometry-guided and temporally aware training approach.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: STVG-o1 enables off-the-shelf multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve state-of-the-art spatio-temporal video grounding performance without architectural changes, using a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism and multi-dimensional reinforcement rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs underperform on STVG tasks due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders, despite their strong language understanding capabilities.

Method: Introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism for explicit spatio-temporal reasoning and a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function with format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards for geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on HCSTVG, outperforming best task-specific method by 7.3% m_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matches specialized models on VidSTG, and surpasses all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins with strong open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal video grounding, demonstrating that off-the-shelf models can achieve superior performance with appropriate reasoning mechanisms and supervision.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiverseVAR enhances diversity in text-conditioned visual autoregressive models without retraining by combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel latent refinement, achieving better diversity-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models suffer from limited diversity, producing nearly identical images for simple prompts, which has been overlooked amid the focus on image quality.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Inject noise into text embeddings to increase diversity, 2) Use scale-travel refinement - a latent refinement technique using multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens and resume generation at intermediate stages to preserve quality.

Result: Combining text-embedding noise injection with scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: DiverseVAR effectively addresses VAR models' diversity limitation at test time without requiring retraining or substantial computational overhead, establishing a better balance between diversity and image quality.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-M3RF is an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that uses both geometric and color features with SE(3) flow matching to reassemble fractured fragments, outperforming previous methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based 3D reassembly methods primarily rely on geometric features, which struggle when geometry is insufficient or ambiguous (e.g., small, eroded, or symmetric fragments). They also lack explicit physical constraints to prevent overlapping assemblies.

Method: Uses multimodal features combining rotation-equivariant geometric features from 3D point positions and color features from a transformer. Predicts transformations using SE(3) flow matching on input point clouds containing both positions and colors.

Result: On the RePAIR dataset, E-M3RF reduces rotation error by 23.1%, translation error by 13.2%, and Chamfer Distance by 18.4% compared to competing methods. Validated on four datasets including synthetic and real-world cultural heritage datasets.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining geometric and color features with equivariant representations significantly improves 3D reassembly performance, especially in challenging cases where geometry alone is insufficient.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Conclusion: MobileI2V demonstrates the feasibility of real-time high-resolution video generation on mobile devices through efficient architecture design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Conclusion: CanKD presents a new paradigm for attention-guided knowledge distillation in computer vision tasks, offering more thorough pixel-wise relationship capture and improved feature representation learning through cross-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods.

Motivation: Deepfake detection effectiveness depends more on implementation details than core design, making fair comparisons difficult and obscuring which factors truly contribute to performance.

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and requires extensive training, while existing automated methods struggle with the complexities of multi-instance multi-label learning in real-world clinical settings involving over 100 antibody types and vast fluorescent pattern combinations.

Method: Proposes a framework with three task-specific components: instance sampler that suppresses low-confidence instances, probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher that adaptively assigns labels based on distinguishability, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients that adjust training based on empirical observations.

Result: Achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over prior methods on ANA dataset, and ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public medical MIML benchmarks, reducing Hamming loss by up to 18.2% and one-error by 26.9%.

Conclusion: The framework successfully handles MIML complexities in ANA detection, supports end-to-end optimization, and sets new state-of-the-art performance for automated autoimmune disorder diagnosis using unaltered microscope images.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

*Pierre Adorni,Minh-Tan Pham,Stéphane May,Sébastien Lefèvre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for Remote Sensing Foundation Models that decomposes training into lightweight task-specific specialists, offering efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility while reducing computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation model approaches require prohibitive computational resources and create environmental concerns due to massive carbon footprints, limiting accessibility to only large institutions and conflicting with sustainable AI principles.

Method: Uses an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework with lightweight task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused, supporting federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration.

Result: The framework provides a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional large foundation models, particularly suitable for collaborative and resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: This approach sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient Remote Sensing Foundation Models that address computational and environmental challenges while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

### [97] [The Age-specific Alzheimer 's Disease Prediction with Characteristic Constraints in Nonuniform Time Span](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21530)
*Xin Hong,Kaifeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel method for generating sequential MRI images with quantitative metrics and age-scaling to predict Alzheimer's disease progression, achieving high structural similarity in synthesized images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Timely identification of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for personalized treatment, but existing methods face challenges in accurately representing disease characteristics from irregular time-interval input sequences.

Method: Innovative sequential image generation methodology guided by quantitative metrics with integrated age-scaling factor to produce age-specific MRI images for predicting advanced disease stages.

Result: Ablation study showed quantitative metrics significantly improve MRI image synthesis accuracy, with age-scaled pixel loss enhancing iterative generation. Structural Similarity Index reached 0.882 for long-term disease prognosis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively maintains essential disease progression features and enables accurate prediction of advanced Alzheimer's disease stages through quantitative-guided image generation with age-scaling.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRFL is a latent-space reward feedback learning framework for video generation that avoids VAE decoding by using pre-trained video models as reward models, enabling full-chain optimization with reduced memory and training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video ReFL methods are inefficient due to pixel-space optimization requiring VAE decoding, which causes high memory overhead and late-stage supervision that misses early motion dynamics.

Method: Leverage pre-trained video generation models as reward models in noisy latent space, enabling preference optimization throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding.

Result: PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Conclusion: Process Reward Feedback Learning provides an efficient latent-space alternative to pixel-space optimization for aligning video generation with human preferences.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

### [99] [UAVLight: A Benchmark for Illumination-Robust 3D Reconstruction in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21565)
*Kang Du,Xue Liao,Junpeng Xia,Chaozheng Guo,Yi Gu,Yirui Guan,Duotun Wang,ShengHuang,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAVLight is a new benchmark dataset for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction that captures scenes along repeatable flight paths at multiple times of day, providing natural lighting variation while maintaining consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination inconsistency is a major challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction, especially in UAV-based applications where lighting changes are unavoidable. Existing datasets either lack meaningful illumination diversity or have confounding geometric/semantic changes that prevent isolated study of lighting robustness.

Method: The authors introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark where each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

Result: UAVLight provides standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, creating a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: This benchmark enables the development of 3D reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments by providing controlled yet realistic illumination variation data.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

*Chou Mo,Yehyun Suh,J. Ryan Martin,Daniel Moyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining 2D/3D landmark registration with U-Net training improves automated landmark detection in pelvic fluoroscopy under variable patient positioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pelvic landmark detection methods assume fixed Antero-Posterior views, but real clinical scenarios involve variable patient positioning due to imaging unit repositioning or patient movement.

Method: Proposed framework incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into U-Net training, comparing baseline U-Net, U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss.

Result: The method addresses the limitation of fixed-view assumptions by handling variable patient pose conditions during intra-operative imaging.

Conclusion: Integrating pose estimation into landmark detection training improves robustness to realistic clinical variations in patient positioning.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

*Teng Hu,Zhentao Yu,Guozhen Zhang,Zihan Su,Zhengguang Zhou,Youliang Zhang,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Ran Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Harmony is a novel framework that addresses audio-visual synchronization challenges in generative AI through cross-task synergy training, global-local decoupled interaction, and synchronization-enhanced CFG, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generation fidelity and fine-grained alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source models struggle with robust audio-video alignment due to three fundamental challenges in joint diffusion: correspondence drift, inefficient global attention mechanisms, and intra-modal bias of conventional CFG that doesn't enhance cross-modal synchronization.

Method: Proposes three key innovations: 1) Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm using audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks to mitigate drift; 2) Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient temporal-style alignment; 3) Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies alignment signals during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show Harmony establishes new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: Harmony successfully overcomes fundamental challenges in joint diffusion processes for audio-visual synthesis, providing a robust framework that mechanistically enforces synchronization and achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

TL;DR: Deep learning model for multiclass classification of 16 oral lesions using stratified data splitting, data augmentation, and oversampling to address imbalanced datasets, achieving 83.33% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oral cancer is often diagnosed late due to visual similarity between benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions. Early computer-aided diagnosis can improve clinical outcomes.

Method: Combines stratified data splitting with advanced data augmentation and oversampling techniques to handle limited and imbalanced datasets for multiclass classification of oral lesions.

Result: Achieved 83.33% accuracy, 89.12% precision, and 77.31% recall, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art methods with notable minority class performance.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a first step toward trustworthy computer-aided diagnostic systems for early oral cancer detection in clinical settings.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

### [103] [Democratizing LLM Efficiency: From Hyperscale Optimizations to Universal Deployability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20662)
*Hen-Hsen Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM efficiency methods (MoE, speculative decoding, complex RAG) only benefit hyperscale providers and proposes a new research agenda focused on robust simplicity for democratizing LLM deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current efficiency methods collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon outside hyperscale contexts, leaving many organizations without viable options and amplifying inequality.

Method: Proposes retrofitting pretrained models without retraining, lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, economical reasoning for long chains of thought, dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and Overhead-Aware Efficiency benchmarking.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework and research agenda rather than empirical results, focusing on redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness.

Conclusion: By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, LLM optimization can reduce inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them, democratizing LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

TL;DR: HTP is a reversible, deterministic framework that generates text embeddings by encoding tokens as harmonic trajectories from Unicode integers, requiring no training or parameters while achieving competitive semantic similarity performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create transparent and efficient text embeddings that don't rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, providing a deterministic alternative to data-driven neural embeddings.

Method: Encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space using phase-coherent projections.

Result: Achieves Spearman correlation of ρ = 0.68 on STS-B benchmark in English, with stable performance across ten languages, negligible computational cost, and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair.

Conclusion: Meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings through harmonic token projection.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

*Yongfu Xue*

TL;DR: PIRA is a training paradigm that improves reward models for LLMs by reformulating question-answer pairs into preference instructions, aggregating rewards from diverse tasks, and stabilizing rewards through dropout averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward models have low data efficiency due to direct concatenation of questions and responses, and are vulnerable to reward overoptimization.

Method: Three strategies: (1) Reformulate question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions, (2) aggregate rewards from diverse preference tasks, (3) average value-head outputs under varying dropout rates.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA in improving reward model performance.

Conclusion: PIRA successfully addresses key challenges in reward modeling by improving data efficiency, reducing bias, and stabilizing rewards through its three-component approach.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

*Mann Khatri,Mirza Yusuf,Rajiv Ratn Shah,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with legal tasks due to lack of domain-specific training. The paper improves performance by reorganizing legal documents using rhetorical roles, defining legal terminology, and emulating court reasoning, achieving 1.5-4.36% F1 score improvements in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific pretraining for law and struggle with long, complex legal documents. Previous approaches used in-context learning to address knowledge gaps without full domain alignment.

Method: Three experimental approaches: (i) reorganizing documents by rhetorical roles for better long context processing, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize models with legal terminology, (iii) emulating court step-by-step reasoning about rhetorical roles. All experiments conducted in zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets.

Result: Significant performance improvements: minimum ~1.5% and maximum 4.36% increase in F1 score compared to baseline. Organizing data and explaining legal terms both boost model performance.

Conclusion: Structuring legal information through rhetorical roles and explaining legal terminology effectively enhances LLM performance on legal tasks without requiring domain-specific pretraining, demonstrating the value of document organization and terminology familiarization in specialized domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: MindSET is a new benchmark dataset with over 13M annotated Reddit posts across 7 mental health conditions, addressing limitations of outdated benchmarks through rigorous preprocessing and quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mental health benchmarks are outdated due to limited data, inadequate cleaning, and inability to handle diverse social media content like multilingual and harmful material.

Method: Curated dataset from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses, applied rigorous preprocessing (language filtering, NSFW removal, duplicate removal), performed LIWC linguistic analysis, and conducted binary classification experiments using fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words features.

Result: MindSET contains over 13M annotated posts (more than twice previous benchmarks), models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed previous benchmarks, achieving up to 18-point F1 improvement for Autism detection.

Conclusion: MindSET provides a robust foundation for mental health research using social media data, supporting early risk detection and analysis of emerging psychological trends.

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

*Zheng Hui,Xiaokai Wei,Reza Shirkavand,Chen Wang,Weizhi Zhang,Alejandro Peláez,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FlexCode introduces a popularity-aware framework for generative recommendation that uses dual codebooks (collaborative filtering and semantic) with dynamic token allocation via MoE to better handle both popular and long-tail items, outperforming uniform codebook approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative recommendation approaches use a single uniform codebook, which fails to address the inherent imbalance between popular items with rich collaborative signals and long-tail items that require semantic understanding, limiting representational efficiency and generalization.

Method: FlexCode adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering codebook and a semantic codebook using a lightweight Mixture of Experts (MoE), with alignment and smoothness objectives to maintain coherence across the popularity spectrum.

Result: Experiments on public and industrial-scale datasets show that FlexCode consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving stronger accuracy and better tail robustness.

Conclusion: FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders that effectively balances memorization and generalization, offering improved performance for both popular and long-tail items.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

TL;DR: Ar-SParC is the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset with 3,450 question sequences (10,225 total questions) and corresponding SQL queries. Experiments with GPT models using various prompt engineering techniques show that a novel GAT corrector approach improves performance by 1.9% in execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of Arabic language resources for cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL tasks, as most existing datasets and research focus on English and Chinese.

Method: Created Ar-SParC dataset with 3,450 question sequences. Conducted 40 experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo with 10 prompt engineering techniques. Developed a novel GAT corrector approach and performed ablation studies.

Result: The GAT corrector enhanced performance across all experiments, yielding average improvements of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

Conclusion: Ar-SParC fills the gap for Arabic text-to-SQL resources, and the proposed GAT corrector method effectively improves model performance for Arabic language processing compared to previous techniques.

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

TL;DR: Large language models like GPT-4 may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning in oncology decision support, with reasoning errors occurring in 23% of interpretations and leading to guideline-discordant, potentially harmful recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the safety implications of faulty reasoning in large language models for oncology decision support, which is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation alone.

Method: Developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes, validated on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks.

Result: Reasoning errors occurred in 23% of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes.

Conclusion: Large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

### [111] [Dynamic Template Selection for Output Token Generation Optimization: MLP-Based and Transformer Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20683)
*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic Template Selection (DTS) adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving 32.6-33.9% token reduction across major LLM providers while maintaining 90.5% routing accuracy, using simpler MLP routing that outperforms more complex transformer approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types lead to substantial token inefficiency, which is costly due to output tokens being 4-8x more expensive than input tokens across major providers.

Method: Two routing approaches: simple MLP using pre-computed embeddings and fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer, evaluated on 1,000 MMLU questions with comprehensive validation across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) using 9,000 production API calls.

Result: MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's 89.5% despite using 125M fewer parameters. Token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9% across providers while routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5%.

Conclusion: DTS provides provider-agnostic template selection that generalizes effectively across LLM providers, offering significant cost reductions without compromising response quality through adaptive response template matching.

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

*Trung Cuong Dang,David Mohaisen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-prefix memorization framework that defines memorization based on the number of distinct prefixes that can elicit a sequence from an LLM, providing a more robust method for detecting data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memorization definitions have shortcomings in comprehensively capturing memorization, especially in aligned models, creating privacy and copyright risks due to verbatim memorization of training data.

Method: Proposed multi-prefix memorization framework where a sequence is considered memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it, focusing on robustness of memory through diversity of retrieval paths.

Result: Experiments on open-source and aligned chat models show that the multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data.

Conclusion: The multi-prefix memorization framework provides a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs by quantifying the robustness of memorization through diverse retrieval paths.

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

TL;DR: SAGE is an agent-based framework that transforms feature interpretation in sparse autoencoders from passive generation to an active, iterative process of explanation formulation, testing, and refinement using empirical feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' internal mechanisms are opaque, posing safety and reliability challenges. While sparse autoencoders help decompose LLM representations into interpretable features, explaining these features remains difficult.

Method: SAGE uses an agent-based approach that systematically formulates multiple explanations per feature, designs targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refines explanations based on empirical activation feedback.

Result: Experiments on SAE features from diverse language models show SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SAGE provides a rigorous methodology for feature interpretation that outperforms existing approaches, offering better understanding of LLM internal representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DSPy+HELM framework that uses structured prompting methods to more accurately benchmark language models, showing that traditional HELM benchmarks underestimate performance and misrepresent rankings when using fixed prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarking frameworks like HELM use fixed prompts that don't generalize well across different language models, leading to unrepresentative performance estimates and potentially underestimating model capabilities.

Method: Developed a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework with structured prompting methods that elicit reasoning. Evaluated four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks using four prompting methods, comparing against existing HELM baseline scores.

Result: Without structured prompting: HELM underestimates LM performance by 4% on average, performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% std dev), leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks, and reasoning reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design.

Conclusion: Scalable performance ceiling estimation through structured prompting enables more accurate and decision-useful benchmarking of language models, addressing limitations of fixed-prompt evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

### [116] [Length-MAX Tokenizer for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20849)
*Dong Dong,Weijie Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Length-MAX tokenizer reduces tokens per character by 14-18% compared to BPE, leading to 18.5% fewer training steps and 13.7% lower inference latency while improving downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenizers like BPE focus on frequency but don't optimize for token length, leading to inefficiencies in training and inference. The authors aim to create a more efficient tokenizer by minimizing average tokens per character.

Method: The Length-MAX tokenizer casts length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and uses a greedy approximation algorithm to obtain vocabulary that minimizes tokens per character.

Result: Achieves 14-18% fewer tokens than BPE across vocabulary sizes, 18.5% fewer training steps to reach validation loss, 13.7% lower inference latency, 16% throughput gain, 11.7% lower LAMBADA perplexity, 4.3% higher HellaSwag accuracy, 99.62% vocabulary coverage, and 18% memory reduction for embeddings and KV-cache.

Conclusion: Optimizing for average token length rather than frequency alone provides an effective approach for more efficient language modeling without sacrificing downstream performance, with production system compatibility.

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations focus on static conversational settings with passive memory retrieval, overlooking the need for dynamic memory accumulation and reuse in real-world environments where LLMs handle continuous task streams.

Method: Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, implements over ten memory modules, and proposes ReMem - an action-think-memory refine pipeline that integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates for continual improvement.

Result: The framework evaluates memory modules across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning/QA datasets, providing baseline method ExpRAG for experience retrieval and utilization.

Conclusion: Evo-Memory bridges the gap in evaluating self-evolving memory capabilities in LLM agents, enabling continuous improvement through dynamic memory management and experience reuse in evolving task environments.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

*Ali Jahan,Masood Ghayoomi,Annette Hautli-Janisz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, testing three training scenarios on English and Persian data to overcome data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of data scarcity in argument mining for low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual transfer and data augmentation techniques.

Method: Three training scenarios: (1) zero-shot transfer using only English data, (2) English-only training enhanced by LLM-generated synthetic examples, and (3) cross-lingual model combining original English data with manually translated Persian sentences.

Result: Zero-shot transfer achieved F1 scores of 50.2% (English) and 50.7% (Persian). LLM-augmentation improved to 59.2% (English) and 69.3% (Persian). Cross-lingual model achieved best performance with 74.8% F1 on Persian test set.

Conclusion: A lightweight cross-lingual approach outperforms resource-intensive augmentation pipelines and provides a practical solution for argument mining in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

Motivation: To understand how large language models internally implement and ground abstract semantic structure, as their internal mechanisms remain insufficiently characterized despite semantic competence.

Method: Integrated approach using role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study semantic role implementation in LLMs.

Result: Found highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes), gradual structural refinement without phase transitions, and moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) with high spectral similarity.

Conclusion: LLMs develop compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure that exhibit partial transfer across different model scales and architectures.

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chatty-KG is a modular multi-agent system that enables conversational question answering over knowledge graphs by combining retrieval-augmented generation with structured SPARQL query execution, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing approaches: LLMs lack direct KG access, RAG systems serialize graph structure and struggle with multi-turn context, while traditional KGQA systems only support single-turn QA and have high latency issues.

Method: Uses task-specialized LLM agents that collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity/relation linking, and query planning to generate executable SPARQL queries from natural language questions.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with higher F1 and P@1 scores on large diverse KGs, works with both commercial and open-weight LLMs, and maintains dialogue coherence without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Chatty-KG successfully unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, providing a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA that preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs perform best on definition-type queries but struggle with exemplification and other answer types, with performance influenced by concept frequency and technical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs excel at definition-type answers but perform poorly on other linguistic query types like examples and paraphrases, and to understand the impact of pre-training data on this performance gap.

Method: Used TrackList analysis pipeline and RefoMed-EN dataset (6170 medical terms with human annotations) to evaluate LLM performance across different query types, analyzing head vs. tail concepts using syntactic/semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations, and embeddings.

Result: LLMs show highest performance on definition-type questions and lowest on exemplification-type questions. For definitions, models paraphrase more on popular/frequent knowledge and less on technical/tail knowledge, especially in expert texts.

Conclusion: LLMs have significant performance disparities across different linguistic query types, with definition-type queries being their strongest area and exemplification being the weakest, highlighting limitations in handling diverse answer formats beyond definitions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

TL;DR: ICL cannot override pre-trained label semantics; it mainly refines existing semantic directions rather than remapping label meanings, with semantic override rates remaining zero across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether in-context learning can override pre-trained label semantics or merely refines an existing semantic backbone by contrasting natural vs inverted demonstrations.

Method: Treat LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers, decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, prompt), introduce semantic override rate, test across 8 classification tasks and 8 LLMs (1-12B parameters) using natural and inverted demonstrations.

Result: ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers; semantic override rates remain exactly zero; correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior even with weak priors.

Conclusion: ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, suggesting fundamental limits of few-shot prompting for overriding label semantics.

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a retrieval-aware approach for sarcasm detection that combines web-based retrieval and self-knowledge awareness to provide contextual information, significantly improving performance over the baseline PMP method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection remains challenging due to linguistic diversity, cultural variations, and unreliable detection of words requiring extra grounding, even with advanced PLMs and LLMs.

Method: A retrieval-aware pipeline that provides context through two complementary approaches: web-based retrieval for non-parametric knowledge when the model lacks background, and self-knowledge awareness to elicit the model's internal knowledge.

Result: Non-parametric retrieval improved macro-F1 by 9.87% on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic dataset. Self-knowledge retrieval improved macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and 4.08% on MUStARD compared to the original PMP method.

Conclusion: Contextual information significantly enhances LLM performance in sarcasm detection, especially for culturally specific slang and unknown terms. Future work will optimize retrieval quality and relevance.

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

### [124] [Enhancing Burmese News Classification with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Head Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21081)
*Thura Aung,Eaint Kay Khaing Kyaw,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo,Thepchai Supnithi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) outperform traditional MLPs as classification heads for low-resource Burmese language tasks, achieving higher F1-scores and better speed-accuracy trade-offs across various embedding types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In low-resource languages like Burmese, current approaches typically freeze pre-trained encoder weights and only fine-tune the final classification layer using MLPs, but MLPs' fixed non-linearity limits expressiveness and increases computational costs.

Method: Evaluated three KAN variants (FourierKAN, EfficientKAN, FasterKAN) as alternative classification heads across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT), comparing them against traditional MLPs.

Result: KAN-based heads were competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved highest F1-score (0.928), FasterKAN offered best speed-accuracy trade-off, and EfficientKAN matched/slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1).

Conclusion: KANs serve as expressive and efficient alternatives to MLPs for classification tasks in low-resource languages, demonstrating improved performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

### [125] [Orthographic Constraint Satisfaction and Human Difficulty Alignment in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21086)
*Bryan E. Tuck,Rakesh M. Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates 28 LLM configurations across three model families on character-level constraint satisfaction tasks, finding that architectural differences create larger performance gaps than parameter scaling, and identifies systematic failures on orthographically unusual but valid words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate how different LLM architectures handle hard orthographic constraints in controlled text generation, as current evaluation is limited and architectural differences may be more important than parameter scaling for constraint satisfaction.

Method: Evaluated 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction, using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle.

Result: Architectural differences produced 2.0-2.2x performance gaps (F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) compared to 83% gain from eightfold parameter scaling. High-capacity models showed strong returns on thinking budget (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturated or degraded. Models showed systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (86-95% human success vs 89-96% model miss rate).

Conclusion: Constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling, as models over-rely on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns.

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

*Ye Bhone Lin,Thura Aung,Ye Kyaw Thu,Thazin Myint Oo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first study on ASR error correction for Burmese using sequence-to-sequence Transformers with IPA and alignment features, achieving significant WER reduction from 51.56 to 39.82 and chrF++ improvement from 0.5864 to 0.627.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ASR error correction specifically for low-resource Burmese language, which has not been previously studied, and to improve ASR outputs in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Used sequence-to-sequence Transformer models with different feature integration strategies including IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) and alignment information, evaluated on five ASR backbones.

Result: The proposed AEC model combining IPA and alignment features reduced average WER from 51.56 to 39.82 (before augmentation) and 51.56 to 43.59 (after augmentation), while improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, showing consistent improvements over baseline ASR outputs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the robustness of ASR Error Correction and highlights the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings, with the proposed approach achieving significant performance gains for Burmese ASR.

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

### [127] [MortgageLLM: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining with Residual Instruction Transfer, Alignment Tuning, and Task-Specific Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21101)
*Manish Jain,Satheesh Kumar Ponnambalam,Salman Faroz,Chandrakanth Lns,Vinay Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MortgageLLM is a domain-specific LLM for mortgage finance that uses a dual-track specialization framework from LLaMA-3.1-8B, creating two specialists - one for conversational Q&A and another for structured tasks - with intelligent task routing to avoid performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge for specialized sectors like mortgage finance while maintaining instruction-following fidelity. Single multi-task models suffer from performance trade-offs between structured tasks and conversational capabilities.

Method: Dual-track specialization framework creating two expert models from a single base model, using instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning, with intelligent task routing mechanism.

Result: Significantly outperforms base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct: LLM-as-a-Judge scores of 4.58 (summarization), 4.09 (Q&A), 2.6 (classification) vs 3.99, 4.0, 1.2 respectively. BERTScore improvements across all tasks.

Conclusion: The dual-expert approach effectively addresses the performance trade-off problem in domain-specific LLM adaptation, demonstrating superior performance in mortgage finance tasks while maintaining instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

*Yuhang Wang,Yanxu Zhu,Dongyuan Lu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGASA framework enhances reasoning model safety by internalizing model-generated guidelines to defend against adversarial jailbreak prompts while minimizing false refusals of benign requests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial jailbreak prompts can evade built-in safety mechanisms and cause harmful content generation, highlighting the need for adaptive safety alignment that enables models to autonomously reinforce defenses.

Method: Two-stage framework: Data Pre-synthesis generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; Alignment Fine-tuning uses SFT and DPO to embed guidelines into the model.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate SGASA significantly improves model safety.

Conclusion: SGASA provides adaptive and scalable effectiveness in enhancing model robustness against harmful adversarial prompts.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

### [129] [Can Finetuing LLMs on Small Human Samples Increase Heterogeneity, Alignment, and Belief-Action Coherence?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21218)
*Steven Wang,Kyle Hunt,Shaojie Tang,Kenneth Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs on small human survey samples improves response heterogeneity and alignment with human behavior, but still fails to reproduce regression coefficients, making LLM-generated data unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether fine-tuning LLMs on small human survey data can mitigate issues like limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions that have been observed in LLM-based simulations.

Method: Used a behavioral experiment on information disclosure to compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and recovery of regression coefficients. Fine-tuned LLMs on small subsets of human survey data.

Result: Fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improved heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models failed to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study.

Conclusion: While fine-tuning improves some aspects of LLM-generated responses, LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses due to their inability to reproduce regression coefficients.

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Development of the first open conversational speech dataset for Isan language, featuring natural speech with authentic linguistic phenomena and addressing challenges of non-standardized orthography through practical transcription protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an inclusive AI resource for underrepresented languages, specifically Isan (the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand), and address the lack of conversational speech datasets that capture authentic linguistic features.

Method: Established practical transcription protocols that balance representational accuracy with computational processing requirements, addressing challenges of non-standardized Isan orthography and variable writing practices due to lexical tone differences with Thai.

Result: Created the first open conversational speech dataset for Isan language containing natural speech with authentic features like colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai.

Conclusion: The released dataset contributes to inclusive AI development, supports research on underrepresented languages, and provides a foundation for addressing linguistic and technical challenges in modeling conversational speech for non-standardized languages.

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

*Robert Belanec,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEFT-Bench is a unified benchmark for evaluating parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on large language models, addressing limitations in current evaluations through comprehensive testing across 27 datasets and 6 PEFT methods with a new metric that considers computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are limited in scope and difficult to reproduce, creating a gap in understanding the true performance and efficiency trade-offs of different PEFT approaches.

Method: Developed PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark that evaluates 6 PEFT methods across 27 NLP datasets on autoregressive LLMs, and introduced PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric that accounts for trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage.

Result: The benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation capabilities for diverse PEFT methods, enabling systematic comparison of their performance and computational efficiency across multiple dimensions.

Conclusion: PEFT-Bench fills an important gap in PEFT evaluation by providing a reproducible, comprehensive framework that considers both performance and computational factors, helping researchers better understand the trade-offs of different parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates Martin's Law (word frequency-polysemy relationship) in neural language models during training, revealing a non-monotonic developmental trajectory with an optimal semantic window around checkpoint 104.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically examine how linguistic regularities like Martin's Law emerge in neural language models during training, establishing methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure.

Method: Used DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings to operationalize word senses, analyzed four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints.

Result: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, peaks at checkpoint 104 (r > 0.6), then degrades. Smaller models show catastrophic semantic collapse while larger models show graceful degradation. Frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r ≈ -0.3).

Conclusion: Compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window rather than monotonically increasing with training.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that introspective awareness in language models can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence, achieving 85% accuracy in detecting injected 'thoughts' through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether introspective capabilities in language models can be directly trained rather than emerging spontaneously, building on Lindsey's findings that models can detect injected activation patterns but unreliably.

Method: Fine-tuning a 7B parameter model on transient single-token injections to detect and identify injected 'thoughts', testing generalization to unseen concept vectors.

Result: Transformed model performance from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts with 0% false positives), satisfying three of Lindsey's criteria for introspective awareness.

Conclusion: At least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced through training, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency and addressing cross-model differences in introspective capabilities.

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper creates a new dataset for fine-grained evidence extraction from Czech and Slovak news comments and evaluates LLMs' performance in identifying exact text spans that support or refute claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation spreads in online news comments, requiring methods to detect incorrect information by identifying relevant documents and exact text evidence that justifies or contradicts claims.

Method: Created a new dataset with two-way annotated fine-grained evidence by paid annotators, then evaluated various large language models (LLMs) on their ability to extract evidence verbatim from source texts.

Result: LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim, leading to invalid outputs. Llama3.1:8b achieved high proportion of correct outputs despite small size, while gpt-oss-120b underperformed. Qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b showed effective balance between model size and human annotation alignment.

Conclusion: Model size doesn't necessarily correlate with better performance in fine-grained evidence extraction, and verbatim copying capability is crucial for this task, with some smaller models outperforming larger ones.

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL is a dual-state reasoning framework that improves Text-to-SQL performance by modeling SQL generation as interaction between adaptive context state and progressive generation state, achieving competitive results on complex databases without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chain-of-Thought approaches struggle with complex enterprise databases due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics.

Method: Dual-state reasoning framework with adaptive context state (refines large schemas and selects relevant structures) and progressive generation state (formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions for self-correction).

Result: Achieved 35.28% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32% on BIRD development set without post-training or in-context examples.

Conclusion: DSR-SQL effectively addresses limitations of previous approaches and provides a competitive solution for Text-to-SQL on complex enterprise databases.

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

### [136] [Odin: Oriented Dual-module Integration for Text-rich Network Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21416)
*Kaifeng Hong,Yinglong Zhang,Xiaoying Hong,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin is a novel architecture that integrates graph structure into Transformers through oriented dual-module mechanism, avoiding multi-hop diffusion and over-smoothing while achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-rich graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for text-attributed graphs either rely on GNNs with limitations like over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion, or use Transformers that ignore graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences.

Method: Odin injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths using an oriented dual-module mechanism, integrating multi-hop structures at specific layers aligned with semantic hierarchy. It operates on global [CLS] representation to avoid over-smoothing. Light Odin is a lightweight variant for efficiency.

Result: Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration, with expressive power strictly containing both pure Transformers and GNNs.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

*Oğuz Kağan Hitit,Leander Girrbach,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model merging for LLMs: Task Arithmetic is the only reliable method among six tested, while other approaches cause performance drops, indicating current techniques don't transfer well to modern LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate whether model merging advantages reported for smaller models generalize to large language models (LLMs), as it remains unclear if current merging methods work effectively on modern LLMs.

Method: Large-scale evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods (including subspace methods) across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks, measuring performance gains over base models and best individual checkpoints.

Result: Task Arithmetic (oldest and simplest method) is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops.

Conclusion: Current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs, motivating the need for LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

*Yurui Zheng,Yijun Chen,Shaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment model that uses sentence-level analysis and pairwise sorting to address text length and ordinal label relationships, achieving competitive performance on Chinese and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing deep learning approaches for readability assessment fail to consider text length and the ordinal relationship between readability labels, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: A bidirectional mechanism captures contextual information to identify semantically rich regions for sentence-level readability prediction, which then assists document-level assessment. A pairwise sorting algorithm models ordinal relationships through label subtraction.

Result: Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets show the model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional approach with sentence-level analysis and ordinal relationship modeling effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and demonstrates strong performance across languages.

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

### [139] [Voice, Bias, and Coreference: An Interpretability Study of Gender in Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21517)
*Lina Conti,Dennis Fucci,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Guillaume Wisniewski,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how speech translation models assign gender to speaker-referring terms, examining the interaction between training data patterns, internal language model biases, and acoustic information across three language pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech conveys speaker gender through acoustic cues like pitch, creating modality-specific bias concerns in speech translation. When translating from gender-neutral languages to languages with grammatical gender, vocal characteristics may influence gender assignment, risking misgendering through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions.

Method: The study examines three language pairs (English-Spanish/French/Italian) and uses contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms to analyze how models assign gender. It investigates training data patterns, internal language model biases, and acoustic information interactions.

Result: Models don't simply replicate term-specific gender associations but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While internal language models show strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences using acoustic input. Higher accuracy models use first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

Conclusion: Speech translation models employ complex mechanisms for gender assignment that go beyond simple pitch-based decisions, using distributed frequency information and linguistic context to make gender determinations, which can help mitigate bias issues in translation.

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoParQ is a new benchmark for evaluating cross-paraphrase consistency in LLMs, using XParaCon metric to measure robustness. A paraphrase-aware SFT strategy significantly improves model consistency, with lightweight models achieving performance comparable to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often show inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, indicating reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding.

Method: Created RoParQ benchmark from standard datasets using proprietary models to generate paraphrases and selectively retain inconsistent examples. Proposed XParaCon metric to quantify robustness via standard deviation of accuracies. Implemented reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning strategy.

Result: Targeted alignment significantly enhanced robustness. Fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The approach effectively mitigates superficial memorization and fosters more robust, reliable LLMs through semantic invariance alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: A novel variance-adaptive multi-resolution voxel grid using spatial hashing for efficient 3D surface reconstruction, achieving 13x speedup and 4x memory reduction compared to fixed-resolution methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional volumetric methods suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and lack GPU support, making real-time 3D reconstruction challenging in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: Proposes a variance-adaptive multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on local SDF variance, using a flat spatial hash table for constant-time access and full GPU parallelism instead of recursive octrees.

Result: Achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines while maintaining comparable reconstruction accuracy, with GPU-accelerated rendering through parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction with superior efficiency and scalability, offering real-time performance through efficient GPU utilization.

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.

### [143] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models can automatically restructure hierarchies to optimize hyperbolic embeddings, showing that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently improve embedding quality across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic embeddings work best with hierarchies that have high branching factors and single inheritance. Since real-world hierarchies often don't meet these criteria, the paper explores using LLMs to automatically restructure existing hierarchies to optimize them for hyperbolic embedding.

Method: The authors propose a prompt-based approach using Large Language Models to transform existing hierarchies, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings (high branching factor, single inheritance). They test this on 16 diverse hierarchies.

Result: Experiments show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics compared to original hierarchies.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively restructure hierarchies to improve hyperbolic embedding quality, and this approach enables explainable reorganizations by providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric and fail to capture specific risks in non-English socio-cultural contexts like Korean, while also being limited to text modality only.

Method: Defined 35 AI risk factors through multidisciplinary expert adaptation, constructed 11,480 multimodal instances using two-phase approach (expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), implemented triple independent annotation and iterative expert red-teaming for quality control.

Result: Created AssurAI - a large-scale Korean multimodal safety dataset with rigorous quality assurance, validated through pilot studies showing effectiveness in assessing LLM safety.

Conclusion: AssurAI facilitates development of safer generative AI systems for Korean community by providing comprehensive multimodal safety evaluation framework with cultural relevance.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A²Flow is an automated framework for generating agentic workflows using self-adaptive abstraction operators, eliminating the need for manually predefined operators and achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automating agentic workflow design heavily rely on manually predefined operators, which limits generalization and scalability. The goal is to create a fully automated framework that can generate reusable operators without human intervention.

Method: A three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based initial operator generation using expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning, 2) Operator clustering and preliminary abstraction to group similar operators across tasks, and 3) Deep extraction for abstract execution operators using long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning. Also includes an operator memory mechanism for enhanced workflow search.

Result: Experiments show A²Flow achieves 2.4% and 19.3% average performance improvement on general and embodied benchmarks respectively, while reducing resource usage by 37% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: A²Flow successfully demonstrates that fully automated agentic workflow generation using self-adaptive abstraction operators is feasible and outperforms existing methods that rely on manual operator predefinition, offering better generalization, scalability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Decomposing reasoning workflows using systems engineering principles is more effective for complex heliophysics problems that require deductive reasoning, demonstrating the value of structured multi-agent approaches over direct prompting.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Motivation: Existing MAPC protocols use static, protocol-defined rules that cannot adapt to dynamic network conditions like varying interference levels and topologies, limiting throughput enhancement in dense Wi-Fi networks.

Method: Models each access point as an autonomous LLM agent with cognitive workflow capabilities including memory, reflection, and tool use, enabling natural language dialogue for collaborative reasoning and real-time strategy negotiation.

Result: Comprehensive simulations show the agentic framework successfully adapts to diverse dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art spatial reuse baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed agentic framework demonstrates potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks by enabling adaptive coordination through autonomous AI agents.

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

Motivation: Current evaluations of autonomous UI-Agents use fixed environments that don't capture reliability across real-world app variations, creating a blind spot in measuring agent trustworthiness when deployed in diverse applications.

Method: Developed OpenApps - a lightweight ecosystem with 6 configurable apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that can generate thousands of app versions using just a single CPU, enabling large-scale reliability testing across app variations.

Result: Testing 7 leading multimodal agents across 10,000+ evaluations showed that while reliability within fixed apps is stable, success rates fluctuate dramatically (over 50%) across app variations - e.g., Kimi-VL-3B's average success dropped from 63% to 4% across different app versions.

Conclusion: Measuring agent reliability across app variations is crucial, as current fixed-environment evaluations significantly underestimate real-world deployment challenges, with agent behaviors like looping and hallucinating actions varying drastically depending on environment configuration.

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RILKE is a scalable method for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs that performs representation-space interventions to update knowledge without retraining, using localized modules and adaptive routing to minimize interference while maintaining general utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce incorrect or outdated content, and updating their knowledge efficiently without costly retraining is challenging, especially for complex unstructured knowledge in lifelong settings where many edits must coexist without interference.

Method: RILKE treats knowledge control as interventions in the model's representation space, learning paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit updates to low-dimensional subspaces to minimize cross-edit interference, with a query-adaptive router for module selection during inference.

Result: Evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models shows RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserved general utility with modest memory overhead.

Conclusion: RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs, enabling fine-grained control over complex unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

### [153] [Guaranteed Optimal Compositional Explanations for Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20934)
*Biagio La Rosa,Leilani H. Gilpin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations of neuron activations in neural networks, addressing limitations of beam search methods that lack theoretical optimality guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current compositional explanation methods use beam search which cannot provide theoretical guarantees of optimality, making it unclear how close explanations are to the true optimum.

Method: Proposed framework includes: (i) decomposition identifying factors influencing spatial alignment, (ii) heuristic to estimate alignment during search, and (iii) first algorithm for computing optimal compositional explanations within feasible time.

Result: Analysis shows 10-40% of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. A beam-search variant guided by the proposed decomposition and heuristic matches or improves runtime while offering greater flexibility.

Conclusion: The framework enables computation of guaranteed optimal compositional explanations, revealing significant suboptimality in current beam search approaches and providing more efficient alternatives.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ENACT is a benchmark that evaluates embodied cognition in vision-language models through world modeling tasks using egocentric interaction in a VQA format, revealing performance gaps between models and humans that widen with interaction complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether modern vision-language models, trained largely in disembodied ways, exhibit signs of embodied cognition - the theory that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation.

Method: ENACT uses a POMDP framework with actions as scene graph changes, featuring two sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder actions given observations). The benchmark synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) spanning 8,972 pairs across long-horizon home activities.

Result: Experiments show a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models perform better on inverse tasks than forward ones and exhibit anthropocentric biases (right-handed action preference, degraded performance with non-human camera parameters).

Conclusion: ENACT provides a systematic way to evaluate embodied cognition capabilities in VLMs, revealing current limitations in embodied reasoning and highlighting the need for models that better capture embodied intelligence principles.

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

*Rahul Dass,Thomas Bowlin,Zebing Li,Xiao Jin,Ashok Goel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ivy is an AI coaching system that combines symbolic TMK models with LLMs to generate structured, multi-step explanations for procedural skills, improving explanation quality over standard LLM approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs produce fluent but shallow explanations that miss the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic needed for effective procedural skill instruction.

Method: Ivy combines symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative LLM layer, using TMK to encode causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions to constrain LLM explanations within explicit structural bounds.

Result: Evaluation against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines shows symbolic constraints consistently improve structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions across three inferential dimensions.

Conclusion: This demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

### [156] [ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005)
*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes ICPO, a new method that uses LLMs' intrinsic generation probabilities to calculate preference advantage scores, which are combined with verifiable rewards to improve reasoning capabilities while addressing issues like coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, leading to unstable training and entropy collapse. The authors aim to leverage LLMs' inherent self-assessment through generation probabilities to address these limitations.

Method: ICPO calculates preference advantage scores by comparing relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, then integrates these scores with verifiable rewards to guide exploration. This approach helps alleviate reward issues and prevents overfitting.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning performance compared to GRPO, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing the identified challenges.

Conclusion: ICPO successfully leverages LLMs' intrinsic confidence through preference modeling to enhance reasoning capabilities, providing a more stable and effective approach to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

*Chujie Wang,Jianyu Lu,Zhiyuan Luo,Xi Chen,Chu He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent transforms open-vocabulary object detection from passive category matching to proactive visual reasoning using a Visual Chain-of-Thought approach, modeled as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process with Bandit exploration for self-evolving detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVOD methods have a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference, with textual space being underexplored despite its importance for performance.

Method: Proposes Visual-CoT with explicit actions, models visual context transitions as w-MDP over eight state spaces, uses Bandit module for exploration signals, and integrates Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model optimization.

Result: Experiments on COCO and LVIS show consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between training and inference in OVOD through proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper abstracts Halpern and Pearl's causality definition to work with any model that defines counterfactuals, enabling broader applications including handling complex formulas with disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Halpern and Pearl's causality definition beyond causal models, allowing application to any model with counterfactuals and handling more complex logical constructs that the original definition cannot process.

Method: Abstracting the key features of Halpern and Pearl's causality definition to create a more general framework that can be applied to various models where counterfactuals are defined, including those allowing backtracking.

Result: The abstracted definition can handle formulas with disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals, and can be extended to define explanation beyond causal models.

Conclusion: Abstracting the causality definition provides broader applicability, deeper understanding of the original definition's features, and enables extension to explanation concepts across different models.

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web introduces a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from LLM reading to programmatic pruning, achieving 25x-50x reduction in candidate elements and dramatically improving grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28% for web automation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based web agents struggle with navigating complex webpages due to prohibitively large DOM structures (10,000-100,000 tokens), relying on crude truncation or inefficient heuristics that risk losing critical information and fail to balance precision with scalability.

Method: DOM Tree Pruning Programming where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks, eliminating the need for LLMs to ingest raw DOMs and delegating traversal to lightweight programs. Includes specialized data annotation pipeline and two-turn dialogue training strategy.

Result: Achieves 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, dramatically improves low-level grounding accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Prune4Web effectively addresses DOM processing challenges in web automation by shifting from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning, enabling precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution in real-world web automation scenarios.

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

Motivation: Drug repurposing is time-efficient and cost-effective but challenging due to fragmented algorithms, heterogeneous data, and the need for multi-disciplinary collaboration. Current tools don't integrate well across workflows.

Method: Multi-agent system built on NeDRex knowledge graph with specialized agents for query routing, data retrieval, network analysis, drug repurposing, functional coherence evaluation, literature mining, and result visualization. Includes reasoning module for hallucination detection.

Result: Provides natural language access to extensive biomedical knowledge, enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses and generate drug repurposing hypotheses.

Conclusion: ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics for drug repurposing, accelerating discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research by keeping users in the loop.

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

TL;DR: MADRA is a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that uses multiple LLM agents to debate instruction safety through collective reasoning, reducing false rejections while maintaining high safety sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for embodied AI safety suffer from high computational costs or over-rejection of safe instructions, creating deployment challenges in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks.

Method: MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate instruction safety, guided by a critical evaluator scoring responses on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Uses iterative deliberation and consensus voting, plus a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework.

Result: Achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while keeping safe-task rejection low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents through collective reasoning and safety-aware planning without requiring training.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical spatial cognition framework with 5 levels and SpatialBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 tasks to systematically evaluate multimodal large language models' spatial reasoning abilities, revealing performance stratification across cognitive levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks oversimplify spatial cognition as single-dimensional metrics, failing to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities in multimodal intelligence.

Method: Proposed a hierarchical spatial cognition framework with 5 progressive levels, constructed SpatialBench (15 tasks), and introduced a unified capability-oriented metric for evaluation across heterogeneous tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but limitations in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Human tests reveal humans perform goal-directed abstraction while MLLMs over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent.

Conclusion: Established the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

TL;DR: Pessimistic verification improves math problem verification by using multiple parallel verifications - a proof is rejected if any single verification finds an error, significantly boosting performance without high computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key limitation in verification performance is error detection capability, so the authors aimed to improve verification of open-ended math questions through simple but effective workflows.

Method: Designed pessimistic verification variants that construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, deeming proofs incorrect if any verification reports an error.

Result: Significantly improved performance across math verification benchmarks without substantial computational resources, with token efficiency surpassing extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Case studies showed many false negatives were due to dataset annotation errors.

Conclusion: Pessimistic verification effectively improves reliability of language model outputs for mathematical problems and enables long-horizon mathematical tasks, with potential to enhance mathematical capabilities across a wide range of tasks.

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: AI models show inconsistent self-disclosure of their AI identity when assigned professional personas, with disclosure rates varying dramatically by domain (3.5% to 73.6%) and being influenced more by model identity than parameter count, revealing that transparency is training-dependent rather than scale-dependent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models can reliably disclose their AI identity when assigned professional personas in high-stakes domains, as failure to do so could lead users to overgeneralize trust and risk harm from false expertise.

Method: Used a common-garden design to audit 16 open-weight models (4B-671B parameters) across 19,200 trials, assigning professional personas and measuring self-disclosure rates, with Bayesian validation using Rogan-Gladen correction for measurement error.

Result: Models showed sharp domain-specific inconsistency in disclosure (Financial Advisor: 30.8%, Neurosurgeon: 3.5%), with disclosure ranging from 2.8% to 73.6% overall. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count, and reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models.

Conclusion: Transparency reflects training factors rather than scale, and organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In an era of rapid technological change and complex global challenges, there's a need for ethical frameworks that help policymakers anticipate emerging opportunities and risks while focusing on sustainable and accountable future design.

Method: The paper establishes foundational principles for responsible computational foresight and presents AI-driven foresight tools, particularly emphasizing the integration of AI with simulations and scenario analysis to enhance policymakers' ability to address uncertainty and evaluate risks.

Result: AI is positioned as a supportive tool that enhances responsible foresight by complementing human judgment, enabling better risk assessment, strategy development, and understanding of complex system interdependencies.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities in addressing 21st century challenges, with AI serving as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human judgment in shaping ethically sound futures.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.
