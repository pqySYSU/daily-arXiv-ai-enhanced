### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench is the first large-scale multimodal benchmark focused on the Indian subcontinent, covering English and 10 Indian languages across OCR, MMT, and VQA tasks with ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across 13 culturally grounded topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most VLM evaluation benchmarks are Western-centric, leaving gaps in understanding model performance in culturally diverse and multilingual settings, particularly for the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with paired parallel corpus across 10 Indic languages, evaluating 8 models (proprietary and open-weights) on 3 multimodal tasks: OCR, MMT, and VQA with 6 question types.

Result: Experiments revealed substantial performance gaps, highlighting limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts and demonstrating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench establishes a reproducible evaluation framework that enables more inclusive multimodal research by centering cultural diversity and multilinguality.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel knowledge-based anomaly detection method for identifying network-induced shape artifacts in synthetic medical images, using angle gradient analysis and isolation forests to ensure synthetic data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data helps address data scarcity but can introduce artifacts that compromise model performance and clinical utility, requiring quality assessment methods.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) feature extractor analyzing per-image distribution of angle gradients along anatomical boundaries, (2) isolation forest-based anomaly detector.

Result: Achieved AUC values of 0.97 and 0.91 on two mammography datasets, with human reader agreement rates of 66% and 68% for most anomalous images, and Kendall-Tau correlations of 0.45 and 0.43.

Conclusion: The method enables responsible use of synthetic data by allowing developers to evaluate synthetic images against anatomic constraints and improve dataset quality.

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Condition Preference Optimization (CPO), a method that improves controllability in text-to-image generation by performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated images, addressing limitations in existing methods like ControlNet++ and Direct Preference Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing controllability in text-to-image generation have limitations: ControlNet++ only optimizes low-noise timesteps and introduces approximation errors, while Direct Preference Optimization suffers from confounding factors where it's difficult to ensure image pairs differ only in controllability while maintaining consistent image quality.

Method: The authors propose Condition Preference Optimization (CPO), which constructs winning and losing control signals (c^w and c^l) and trains the model to prefer c^w. This approach eliminates confounding factors by performing preference learning directly over control conditions rather than generated images, resulting in a lower-variance training objective.

Result: Extensive experiments show CPO significantly improves controllability over state-of-the-art ControlNet++: over 10% error rate reduction in segmentation, 70-80% in human pose, and consistent 2-5% reductions in edge and depth maps. CPO also requires less computation and storage for dataset curation.

Conclusion: CPO provides a more effective approach for improving controllability in text-to-image generation by addressing key limitations of existing methods through condition-based preference optimization, achieving superior performance with lower variance and computational requirements.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN is a novel decoder architecture that dynamically adapts regularization based on task complexity for geospatial foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both full fine-tuning and efficient adaptation paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard adaptation methods for foundation models in geospatial analysis use fixed regularization strategies that fail to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: DARN integrates three innovations: Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) for per-sample difficulty estimation, Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM) that dynamically adjusts dropout rates (0.1-0.5), and Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) for channel activation modulation.

Result: DARN achieves new state-of-the-art on GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp improvement) in full fine-tuning, and SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) in efficient adaptation with superior OOD generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU), enhanced robustness (17% corruption error reduction), and improved minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides a more intelligent, robust, and efficient approach to leveraging foundation models in critical geospatial applications by dynamically adapting regularization based on task complexity.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

### [5] [Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds & Tropical Cyclones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773)
*Shirin Ermis,Cesar Aybar,Lilli Freischem,Stella Girtsou,Kyriaki-Margarita Bintsi,Emiliano Diaz Salas-Porras,Michael Eisinger,William Jones,Anna Jungbluth,Benoit Tremblay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework using pre-training and fine-tuning translates 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps for tropical cyclones, enabling global 3D cloud reconstruction even for intense storms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate tropical cyclone forecasting is challenging due to limited satellite observations of TC structure and difficulties resolving cloud properties involved in intensification.

Method: Pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties, applied to a custom-built TC dataset.

Result: First-time creation of global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurate reconstruction of 3D structure of intense storms; extends available satellite observations and provides estimates when observations are missing.

Conclusion: This framework is crucial for advancing understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts by providing comprehensive 3D cloud structure data.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [6] [EETnet: a CNN for Gaze Detection and Tracking for Smart-Eyewear](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04779)
*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet is a CNN for event-based eye tracking that can run on microcontrollers, with two versions: classification for grid-based pupil detection and regression for pixel-level operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based eye tracking solutions are limited to powerful GPUs and lack deployment on embedded devices, despite the efficiency benefits of event-based cameras.

Method: Developed a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely event-based data, with training, evaluation, and quantization methodology using public datasets. Proposed two architecture versions: classification model for grid-based pupil detection and regression model for pixel-level operation.

Result: Created EETnet capable of running on microcontrollers with limited resources, enabling deployment of efficient event-based eye tracking on embedded devices.

Conclusion: EETnet successfully bridges the gap between event-based eye tracking research and practical embedded deployment, offering efficient solutions for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Point Encoder is an explicit geometric representation using mixtures of 3D Gaussians for 3D recognition tasks, offering faster performance, better parameter efficiency, and lower computational requirements than traditional PointNets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move from implicit representations like PointNet to explicit geometric representations for 3D recognition tasks, similar to the shift from NeRF to Gaussian Splatting in 3D reconstruction, enabling computational geometry optimizations.

Method: Developed optimization techniques using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn 3D Gaussian encoders, and extended filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting to accelerate performance.

Result: Achieved 2.7x faster speed than comparable PointNet with 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. When used in Mamba3D, achieved 1.27x faster speed with 42% memory reduction and 54% FLOPs reduction. Lightweight enough for high framerates on CPU-only devices.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders provide an effective explicit geometric representation alternative to implicit methods, offering significant performance improvements in speed, memory efficiency, and computational requirements for 3D recognition tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method that splits Gaussian Splatting into foreground and background components to improve dynamic 3D reconstruction from sparse multi-view video, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deformable Gaussian Splatting methods struggle with sparse camera configurations common in filmmaking due to budget constraints, limiting their ability to capture complex dynamic features.

Method: The approach separates canonical Gaussians and deformation field into foreground and background using sparse masks at t=0. Each component is trained with different loss functions during canonical pre-training, and different parameters are modeled for each deformation field during dynamic training based on filmmaking practices.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative results with up to 3 PSNR higher performance and half the model size on 3D scenes. The method also produces segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures without dense mask supervision.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of sparse camera configurations in dynamic 3D reconstruction, achieving superior performance while requiring less computational resources and producing segmented outputs.

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

### [9] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study analyzes data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose. It shows that only 10% of training data is needed for performance saturation, and demonstrates that selective data replay can mitigate forgetting during cross-domain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two underexplored challenges in generalist biomedical image segmentation: training data redundancy and the impact of cross-domain transfer on model retention, using Cellpose as a case study.

Method: Proposed dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact training subsets, conducted latent space analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE, performed cross-domain finetuning experiments, and tested selective DQ-based replay and training domain sequencing.

Result: Image segmentation performance saturates with only 10% of data, revealing substantial redundancy. Cross-domain finetuning causes significant source domain degradation, but selective replay with 5-10% source data effectively restores performance while full replay hinders target adaptation. Training domain sequencing improves generalization and reduces forgetting.

Conclusion: Data-centric design is crucial for biomedical image segmentation, requiring not only compact training subsets but also retention-aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering for efficient training.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [10] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-centric AI workflow combining active learning and pseudo-labeling to reduce manual annotation needs in biomedical image segmentation, leveraging foundation models for initial labels and nnU-Net for automated configuration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional methods with noisy data, nnU-Net's need for extensive annotated data, and foundation models' underperformance on domain-specific datasets, while minimizing human intervention.

Method: Pipeline generates pseudo-labels from foundation models for nnU-Net self-configuration, selects representative core-set for minimal manual annotation, then fine-tunes nnU-Net model.

Result: Significantly reduces manual annotation requirements while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Provides accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply state-of-the-art AI techniques in segmentation tasks with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

### [11] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry denoising method using surface normal priors and segmentation, solved via split Bregman optimization with second-order shape calculus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage prior knowledge about preferred surface normal vectors for more effective geometry denoising while naturally incorporating segmentation.

Method: Uses label vectors as normal priors, embeds segmentation based on normal similarity, applies total variation regularization, and solves via split Bregman (ADMM) approach with vertex updates using second-order shape calculus.

Result: A novel denoising paradigm that simultaneously performs geometry denoising and segmentation based on normal vector similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively integrates normal priors and segmentation into geometry denoising through an optimization framework with proven solution methods.

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

### [12] [Self-Supervised Implicit Attention Priors for Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04864)
*Kyle Fogarty,Chenyue Cai,Jing Yang,Zhilin Guo,Cengiz Öztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An implicit self-prior approach that learns shape-specific priors directly from input point clouds using cross-attention with a learnable dictionary, combined with RIMLS for high-fidelity surface reconstruction without external training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface reconstruction from irregular point clouds is ill-posed without strong geometric priors, and existing methods often require external training data or fail to preserve fine details while handling sparse regions.

Method: Jointly trains a dictionary of learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field using cross-attention, then samples the trained field for dense points and normals, integrating them into robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS) formulation.

Result: Outperforms both classical and learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively preserves fine geometric details while leveraging learned priors to regularize sparse regions, demonstrating successful surface reconstruction without external training data.

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

### [13] [Clinical-ComBAT: a diffusion-weighted MRI harmonization method for clinical applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04871)
*Gabriel Girard,Manon Edde,Félix Dumais,Yoan David,Matthieu Dumont,Guillaume Theaud,Jean-Christophe Houde,Arnaud Boré,Maxime Descoteaux,Pierre-Marc Jodoin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Clinical-ComBAT is a new harmonization method for diffusion-weighted MRI data that addresses limitations of existing ComBAT by enabling independent site harmonization, non-linear modeling, and adaptability to small clinical cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DW-MRI harmonization methods like ComBAT have limitations for clinical use due to their reliance on linear relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and large sample sizes, which don't reflect real-world clinical scenarios.

Method: Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently using a non-linear polynomial data model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, variance priors for small cohorts, hyperparameter tuning, and goodness-of-fit assessment metrics.

Result: The method demonstrated improved alignment of diffusion metrics on both simulated and real data, showing enhanced applicability for normative modeling compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT provides a flexible and effective harmonization solution for real-world clinical DW-MRI data, overcoming key limitations of existing methods and enabling better multi-site data integration.

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

### [14] [Validating Vision Transformers for Otoscopy: Performance and Data-Leakage Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04872)
*James Ndubuisi,Fernando Auat,Marta Vallejo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (Swin v1/v2) initially showed superior accuracy (100%/99.1%) for ear disease diagnosis compared to ResNet (99.5%), but performance dropped significantly (83%/82%) after fixing data leakage in preprocessing, highlighting the critical importance of rigorous data handling in medical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the 27% misdiagnosis rate among otolaryngologists by evaluating whether vision transformer models can improve diagnostic accuracy for ear diseases compared to traditional CNNs.

Method: Used real-world otoscopic video dataset from a clinical hospital, selected frames using Laplacian and Shannon entropy thresholds, removed blank frames, and compared Swin v1, Swin v2 transformer models against ResNet CNN model.

Result: Initial results showed Swin v1 (100%), Swin v2 (99.1%), and ResNet (99.5%) accuracy, but after correcting data leakage in preprocessing, performance dropped to 83% for both Swin models and 82% for ResNet.

Conclusion: Vision transformers show promise but rigorous data handling is crucial; optimal balance between advanced model architectures and effective data preprocessing is key for reliable medical diagnosis models.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geospatial deep learning framework using satellite imagery to predict fatal crash risks with uncertainty-aware Beta probability distributions, outperforming baselines by 17-23% in recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic safety studies examine risk factors in isolation and lack spatial complexity consideration, while conventional neural networks provide point estimates without uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical decision-making.

Method: Novel geospatial deep learning framework leveraging satellite imagery as comprehensive spatial input to capture nuanced spatial patterns and environmental risk factors, estimating full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk.

Result: Model achieves 17-23% improvement in recall compared to baselines while delivering superior calibration, providing accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for fatal crash risks.

Conclusion: The method enables safer autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively through reliable and interpretable risk assessments from satellite imagery alone.

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

*Hu Gao,Xiaoning Lei,Ying Zhang,Xichen Xu,Guannan Jiang,Lizhuang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes IMDNet, an adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that uses decoupled degradation representations to guide path selection for handling multiple coexisting degradations like rain, noise, and haze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing image restoration methods focus on single degradation types, but real-world images often suffer from multiple coexisting degradations, limiting practical effectiveness.

Method: Uses degradation ingredient decoupling blocks (DIDBlock) to separate degradation ingredients statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information, fusion blocks (FBlock) to integrate degradation information across levels, and task adaptation blocks (TABlock) to dynamically activate/fuse functional branches based on multi-degradation representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: IMDNet provides an effective tightly integrated architecture for handling multiple coexisting image degradations through adaptive path selection guided by decoupled degradation representations.

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Conclusion: The publicly available dataset provides an essential resource for future AI dentistry research, demonstrating significant improvements in dental AI applications through multimodal data and model fine-tuning.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over

vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning framework using high-dimensional latent space representations and Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) for robust and adaptive watermarking to detect deepfakes, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing deepfake detectors that struggle with generalization to new deepfake types and the challenge of balancing robustness against benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering in proactive watermarking approaches.

Method: Develop a learnable watermark embedder operating in latent space to capture high-level image semantics, combined with MAARL paradigm where a watermarking agent interacts with an adversarial attacker agent simulating various image manipulations to optimize robustness-fragility balance.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks show consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under challenging manipulation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the robustness-fragility trade-off in deepfake watermarking through latent space representations and adversarial reinforcement learning, demonstrating superior performance in detecting synthetic media.

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLM is a system that enables 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to render large scenes on consumer-grade GPUs by offloading Gaussians to CPU memory and implementing an efficient pipelining strategy to overlap communication and computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS has high rendering quality but requires large GPU memory that exceeds consumer-grade GPU capacities, making it challenging to scale to large scenes.

Method: CLM uses CPU memory offloading with a novel strategy that exploits 3DGS memory access patterns for pipelining, overlapping GPU-CPU communication with GPU and CPU computations, and reducing communication volume.

Result: The system can render scenes with 100 million Gaussians on a single RTX4090 GPU while achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: CLM successfully enables 3DGS to scale to large scenes on consumer hardware through efficient memory management and communication optimization.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDS is a novel method for synthesizing missing fMRI and dMRI modalities using a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework with tissue refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance in cross-modality learning for neurodegenerative disease studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing MRI modalities (fMRI and dMRI) create major barriers for clinical use in neurodegenerative disease studies. Existing GAN and diffusion models struggle with fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to significant signal differences between BOLD and diffusion-weighted signals, and inadequate integration of disease-related neuroanatomical patterns.

Method: Proposed PDS method with two key innovations: (1) pattern-aware dual-modal 3D diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) tissue refinement network integrated with efficient microstructure refinement to maintain structural fidelity and fine details.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house datasets: PSNR/SSIM scores of 29.83 dB/90.84% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12% over baselines) and 30.00 dB/77.55% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2%). Clinical validation showed 67.92%/66.02%/64.15% accuracy for NC vs. MCI vs. AD classification in hybrid real-synthetic experiments.

Conclusion: PDS successfully addresses the challenges of fMRI-dMRI synthesis through its dual-modal diffusion framework and tissue refinement, demonstrating strong diagnostic performance and providing a practical solution for handling missing modalities in neurodegenerative disease research.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

*Jian Wang,Yixing Yong,Haixia Bi,Lijun He,Fan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to optimize geometric shapes that can serve as semantic carriers for DNNs, act as interpretability tools to identify salient regions, and function as adversarial examples to deceive visual tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks have primarily focused on texture understanding, leaving their geometric comprehension poorly explored. The research aims to probe DNNs' geometric world and understand machine perception through shape-based approaches.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework that unifies Fourier series for shape parameterization, winding number-based mapping for pixel grid translation, and signal energy constraints for optimization efficiency and physical plausibility.

Result: Optimized shapes can generate high-confidence classifications from purely geometric inputs, precisely isolate model's salient regions as interpretability tools, and constitute a generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides a versatile framework for probing DNNs' geometric understanding and opens new frontiers for challenging and understanding machine perception through shape-based approaches.

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic method for generating labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, and uses this dataset to train a genus estimator network based on a 3D convolutional transformer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TDA methods like persistent homology are computationally demanding, and there's a lack of labeled 3D data specifically designed for supervised learning in TDA tasks, which hinders the development of neural network-based estimators.

Method: Uses the Repulsive Surface algorithm to systematically generate labeled 3D datasets with controlled topological invariants (hole count), and trains a genus estimator network using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture on this synthetic dataset.

Result: The trained genus estimator network shows decreased accuracy as deformations increase, highlighting that both topological complexity and geometric complexity affect the performance of generalized estimators.

Conclusion: The generated dataset addresses the gap in labeled 3D datasets for TDA and demonstrates the importance of considering both topological and geometric complexity when training generalized estimators.

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

TL;DR: DRE-SLCL is a method for end-to-end Whole Slide Image representation that uses dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning to handle gigapixel WSIs containing thousands of tiles, overcoming GPU limitations through memory bank feature storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training end-to-end WSI representation models is challenging due to GPU memory limitations when processing gigapixel slides containing tens of thousands of image tiles in a single mini-batch.

Method: Uses memory bank to store tile features across all WSIs, samples subset of tiles per WSI, retrieves additional features from memory bank, applies residual encoding to generate WSI representation, and computes slide-level contrastive loss using histopathology reports.

Result: Experiments on cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Conclusion: The DRE-SLCL approach successfully addresses the computational challenges of end-to-end WSI representation learning and proves effective for various cancer-related tasks.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion is a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes human motion from ground pressure sequences and text prompts, eliminating the need for cameras or wearable devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture without specialized equipment by addressing the ill-posed problem of inferring full-body motion from pressure signals.

Method: Uses a dual-level feature extractor to interpret pressure data and a hierarchical diffusion model that leverages both physical cues from pressure sequences and semantic guidance from text prompts to generate motion.

Result: The method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible motions and establishes a new state-of-the-art for this task, with the MPL benchmark being the first benchmark for pressure-to-motion generation.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion is a pioneering work that successfully combines pressure data and linguistic priors for motion generation, offering a practical solution for privacy-sensitive and cost-effective motion capture applications.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Introduces three strategies: Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) to reduce cumulative errors, Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) for boundary sensitivity, and memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization for difficult tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg offers a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional MRIS pipelines by simplifying model design while leveraging pretrained multimodal tokenizers for enhanced generalization.

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

### [28] [No Pose Estimation? No Problem: Pose-Agnostic and Instance-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05055)
*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PITTA is a novel test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that works without camera pose information and uses instance-aware masking of dynamic objects to improve performance in diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation are ineffective in diverse and dynamic real-world environments, requiring a more robust approach that doesn't rely on camera pose information.

Method: PITTA uses two key strategies: (1) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm that works without camera pose information, and (2) instance-aware image masking that extracts dynamic object masks from panoptic segmentation and removes static background components. It also includes an edge extraction method for input images and depth maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets show PITTA surpasses state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable performance improvements in monocular depth estimation during test-time adaptation.

Conclusion: PITTA provides an effective test-time adaptation framework for monocular depth estimation that works in pose-agnostic manner and handles dynamic environments through instance-aware masking, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP is a novel data synthesis framework that uses multi-perspective role-playing prompts to generate semantically diverse captions from MLLMs, improving CLIP model performance with fewer training pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic data generation methods focus on increasing data volume but lead to limited semantic diversity and redundant captions, limiting CLIP model effectiveness.

Method: Leverages multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., compositional analyst, interpreter of image context) to guide MLLMs in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints.

Result: CLIP-B/16 model trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves Recall@1 of 64.1% on MS COCO validation set, surpassing best existing synthetic baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points.

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP effectively enhances semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment of synthetic pairs, improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while maintaining the same number of image-text pairs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPPP is a dual-stage framework that generates diverse virtual person Re-ID data using diffusion models with rich prompts, then uses prompt-driven disentanglement to learn domain-invariant features, achieving state-of-the-art generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in person re-identification by creating virtual data alternatives that overcome challenges of existing virtual datasets like complex construction and poor domain generalization.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate diverse virtual dataset (GenePerson) using diffusion models driven by multi-dimensional prompts; 2) Use Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism with contrastive learning to separate style and content features for domain-invariant learning.

Result: Created GenePerson dataset with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. Models trained with PDM achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance, surpassing those trained on popular real and virtual Re-ID datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed DPPP framework effectively addresses privacy concerns in person Re-ID while achieving superior domain generalization through virtual data generation and prompt-driven feature disentanglement.

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

TL;DR: A dual-level reinforcement learning framework for adverse weather visual perception that combines physics-driven dataset construction with adaptive model orchestration, achieving state-of-the-art performance without paired supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to generalize to complex real-world weather degradations, requiring more adaptive and robust solutions.

Method: Constructed HFLS-Weather dataset using physics-driven simulation, then designed dual-level RL framework: local level refines weather-specific models via perturbation-driven quality optimization, global level uses meta-controller for dynamic model selection and execution order.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across diverse adverse weather scenarios with continuous adaptation to real-world conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective adaptation to complex weather degradations without paired supervision, demonstrating superior performance in adverse weather visual perception tasks.

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

*Yasemin Turkan,F. Boray Tek,M. Serdar Nazlı,Öykü Eren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study applies deep learning to raw OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection, achieving an AUC of 0.62 with ResNet-34 in a 4-year prediction window, marking the first such application in literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore direct classification of OCT B-scan images for early Alzheimer's disease detection, moving beyond traditional segmented layer thickness measurements, since early detection is more challenging than diagnosis as imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years.

Method: Fine-tuned multiple pretrained models (ImageNet-based networks and OCT-specific RETFound transformer) using subject-level cross-validation from UK Biobank, with standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques and a year-weighted loss function prioritizing cases diagnosed within four years of imaging.

Result: ResNet-34 produced the most stable results with AUC of 0.62 in the 4-year cohort, and explainability analyses confirmed localized structural differences in the central macular subfield between AD and control groups.

Conclusion: While below clinical application threshold, this provides a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlights challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before diagnosis, and points to need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lane detection in snow-covered environments is challenging due to frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings, creating a need for alternative approaches that work in adverse winter conditions.

Method: Detects vertical roadside posts (delineators) as indirect lane indicators, then fits smooth lane trajectories using parameterized Bezier curve model while leveraging spatial consistency and road geometry.

Result: The approach demonstrates significantly improved robustness in adverse weather compared to state-of-the-art lane detection systems, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for reliable lane detection in winter scenarios and contributes a valuable dataset (SnowyLane) for future all-weather autonomous driving research.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIXEL is a knowledge distillation method that enables vision foundation models to produce high-resolution feature maps more efficiently by having students learn to reproduce their own feature maps at higher resolutions, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models like DINOv3 require high-resolution input images and substantial computational resources due to transformer architecture's quadratic complexity, limiting their practical deployment.

Method: Proposes BRIXEL - a simple knowledge distillation approach where the student model learns to reproduce its own feature maps at higher resolution through self-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks at fixed resolution, and produces feature maps similar to teacher models at a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: BRIXEL provides an effective solution for reducing computational requirements while maintaining high-quality feature extraction capabilities in vision foundation models.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code

TL;DR: MUSE is a self-supervised learning method for nucleus detection and classification in histopathology that uses multi-scale dense self-distillation and a nucleus-based local self-distillation mechanism to learn discriminative nucleus representations without requiring labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations.


<details>

Motivation: Existing methods for nucleus detection and classification rely heavily on labor-intensive nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled data for learning discriminative nucleus representations.

Method: Proposes MUSE with NuLo (Nucleus-based Local self-distillation) - a coordinate-guided mechanism enabling flexible local self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions, removing need for strict spatial alignment between augmented views. Also includes an encoder-decoder architecture and large field-of-view semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks show MUSE effectively addresses core challenges of histopathological nucleus detection and classification. The resulting models surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines and outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: MUSE provides an effective self-supervised learning approach for nucleus detection and classification that reduces dependency on labor-intensive annotations while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Motivation: To extend the original Walk the Lines algorithm beyond color ship segmentation to handle infrared ships and diverse RGB objects, providing detailed segmentation for specialized applications requiring high-quality samples.

Method: Uses contour tracking to refine object contours until achieving 1-pixel-wide closed shapes, adapting the object contour detector for IR ships and enhancing the algorithm for various RGB objects, replacing standard non-maximum suppression.

Result: WtL2 outperforms latest contour-based methods in achieving closed object contours, delivers high peak Intersection over Union with impressive detail, and broadens application range to IR and diverse RGB objects.

Conclusion: WtL2 is positioned as a compelling method for specialized applications requiring detailed segmentation or high-quality samples, potentially accelerating progress in niche image segmentation areas.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for

Motivation: Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization, while inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference costs due to dual-path denoising.

Method: FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising. It introduces Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD) to separate the key timestep from the noised latent used in attention extraction, providing finer control over attention quality and eliminating structural artifacts.

Result: FreeControl enables structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images with the flexibility for intuitive compositional design, compatible with modern diffusion models at approximately 5% additional cost.

Conclusion: FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control in diffusion models, offering efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining while supporting compositional control via reference images from multiple sources.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown camera poses remains challenging, as existing methods like NeRF and 3DGS struggle with dynamic content and typically require pre-computed camera poses.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Uses 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, 2) Motion-aware refinement with MA-BA module (combining transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for dynamic object segmentation) and MA-GS representation (using control points with deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning).

Result: Achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.

Conclusion: 4D3R provides an effective pose-free solution for dynamic neural rendering that significantly outperforms existing methods in both quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An online skeleton-based motion recognition system using SPD matrix representation and Siamese network for continuous detection and classification of unsegmented motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing skeleton-based motion recognition works focus on segment-based approaches, which are not suitable for real-time online scenarios where continuous motion recognition is needed.

Method: Proposes a two-component system: a detector using SPD matrix representation and a classifier using Siamese network to predict motion intervals and recognize motions in unsegmented sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on hand gesture and body action benchmarks show the system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases.

Conclusion: The proposed online recognition system effectively handles continuous motion recognition using SPD matrices and Siamese networks, demonstrating superior performance for real-time applications.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

### [41] [ADPretrain: Advancing Industrial Anomaly Detection via Anomaly Representation Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05245)
*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel anomaly detection representation learning framework that addresses limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features by using angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses on a large-scale AD dataset, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection methods rely on ImageNet-pretrained features, which are suboptimal due to distribution shift between natural and industrial images, and because ImageNet pretraining doesn't specifically target normal vs abnormal discrimination.

Method: Proposed a specialized AD representation learning framework using angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize angle size and norm differences between normal and abnormal features, pretrained on RealIAD dataset with residual features for class-generalizable representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and five backbones consistently showed superiority of the pretrained features when replacing original features in five embedding-based AD methods.

Conclusion: The proposed AD-specific pretraining framework effectively addresses limitations of ImageNet-pretrained features and significantly improves anomaly detection performance across various datasets and backbones.

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

*Jack Hong,Chenxiao Zhao,ChengLin Zhu,Weiheng Lu,Guohai Xu,Xing Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2 is an agentic multimodal model that integrates tool invocation (code execution, web search) with reasoning through a two-stage training pipeline: cold-start for tool-use patterns and reinforcement learning for refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build agentic multimodal models that not only comprehend text and images but also actively invoke external tools and integrate these operations into reasoning processes.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, followed by reinforcement learning stage to refine tool invocation. Curated diverse training dataset with examples where tool use is beneficial.

Result: DeepEyesV2 demonstrates effectiveness across real-world understanding, mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation and selective tool use based on context.

Conclusion: The study provides guidance for developing agentic multimodal models, showing that reinforcement learning enables complex tool combinations and context-aware tool selection.

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D U-Net model trained on cropped regions around tumors significantly outperforms full-volume training for automatic segmentation of colorectal liver metastases in intraoperative ultrasound, achieving expert-level accuracy with 4x faster execution for real-time surgical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast, noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.

Method: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference (RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets.

Result: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC = 0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~1 min). Prospective intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance.

Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing manual workload and procedure time.

*Matteo Bastico,David Ryckelynck,Laurent Corté,Yannick Tillier,Etienne Decencière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes flaws in existing Chamfer Distance-based metrics for point cloud evaluation, proposes improved metrics including Density-Aware Chamfer Distance and Surface Normal Concordance, and introduces a new Diffusion Point Transformer architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShapeNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for 3D point cloud generation lack robustness and fail to properly assess geometric fidelity and local shape consistency. There's a need for more reliable metrics and better generative models.

Method: The authors propose: 1) sample alignment before distance calculation, 2) Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) to replace standard CD, 3) Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) metric for surface similarity assessment, and 4) Diffusion Point Transformer architecture using transformer-based models for point cloud generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ShapeNet show the proposed model outperforms previous solutions, achieving new state-of-the-art in point cloud generation quality. The new metrics provide more comprehensive evaluation of generated samples.

Conclusion: The combination of improved evaluation metrics (DCD and SNC) with the novel Diffusion Point Transformer architecture enables more robust assessment and higher-quality generation of 3D point clouds, addressing limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuisineSense is a wearable system that uses smartwatch hand motion and smart glasses head dynamics to detect eating states and classify Chinese food types, addressing privacy concerns and food diversity limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-report dietary monitoring suffers from recall bias, camera-based approaches raise privacy issues, and existing wearable methods only handle limited Western food types, failing to address the diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Method: A two-stage detection pipeline: first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors, second stage performs fine-grained food type recognition using hand motion from smartwatch and head dynamics from smart glasses.

Result: Evaluated on a dataset of 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants, achieving high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification.

Conclusion: CuisineSense provides a practical, unobtrusive solution for wearable-based dietary monitoring that addresses Chinese food diversity while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures in GNSS-denied environments like planetary exploration, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity, creating a need for more robust multimodal solutions.

Method: MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy using DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for candidate screening, combined with SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification and explicit 6-DoF pose estimation.

Result: Experiments on S3LI and S3LI Vulcano datasets show MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions.

Conclusion: MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability by providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both

unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking using reinforcement learning with a novel GRPO-CSV method that verifies search completeness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing temporal search methods rely on hand-crafted search processes without end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies, leading to suboptimal performance in long-form video understanding.

Method: Proposes TimeSearch-R with GRPO-CSV (Group Relative Policy Optimization with Completeness Self-Verification), which integrates searching video clips into reasoning through RL and verifies search adequacy using the same policy model. Also constructs specialized datasets for SFT cold-start and RL training.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks (Haystack-LVBench, Haystack-Ego4D) and long-form video understanding benchmarks (VideoMME, MLVU). Establishes new SOTA on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over Video-R1.

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R effectively addresses limitations of existing temporal search methods through RL-based interleaved reasoning and completeness verification, demonstrating superior performance across multiple video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sentence-to-Image Steganography, a semantic steganography method that embeds sentence-level messages into images using large language models, creating the IVT benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional steganography struggles with embedding semantically rich, sentence-level information, but the AIGC era demands higher capacity steganography for hiding meaningful textual content in images.

Method: The authors propose S²LM (Semantic Steganographic Language Model), which uses LLMs to embed high-level textual information into images through a novel pipeline where LLMs are involved throughout the entire embedding process.

Result: Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic capabilities for LLMs, enabling embedding of sentences and paragraphs into images.

Conclusion: The work presents a breakthrough in semantic steganography by enabling sentence-level message embedding into images using LLMs, with the IVT benchmark established for future evaluation and source code to be released.

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic

TL;DR: The paper introduces Artic4D dataset for 4D articulated object perception and proposes CanonSeg4D framework for 4D panoptic segmentation using canonical space alignment to improve part-level segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore temporal dynamics in articulated object perception, and 4D temporal data remains unexplored for panoptic segmentation. The lack of benchmark datasets further hinders progress in this field.

Method: Proposed CanonSeg4D framework that estimates per-frame offsets to map observed object parts to a learned canonical space, enabling consistent alignment of object parts across sequential frames for enhanced segmentation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Artic4D dataset show that CanonSeg4D outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical alignment for dynamic object understanding, paving the way for future advances in 4D articulated object perception.

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances

*Shiyao Xu,Benedetta Liberatori,Gül Varol,Paolo Rota*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dense Motion Captioning - a task to temporally localize and caption actions in 3D human motion sequences, presents the CompMo dataset with 60,000 complex motion sequences, and proposes DEMO model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses mainly on text-to-motion generation while motion understanding remains underexplored. Existing datasets lack detailed temporal annotations and primarily contain short sequences with few actions.

Method: Created CompMo dataset with 60,000 motion sequences through a carefully designed pipeline, each containing 2-10 actions with precise temporal boundaries. Proposed DEMO model that integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter to generate dense, temporally grounded captions.

Result: DEMO substantially outperforms existing methods on both CompMo dataset and adapted benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion understanding and captioning.

Conclusion: The work addresses the gap in motion understanding research by introducing dense motion captioning task, providing a comprehensive dataset, and demonstrating superior performance with the proposed DEMO model.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

### [55] [PreResQ-R1: Towards Fine-Grained Rank-and-Score Reinforcement Learning for Visual Quality Assessment via Preference-Response Disentangled Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05393)
*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1 is a novel reinforcement learning framework for visual quality assessment that combines absolute score regression and relative ranking consistency through a dual-branch reward system, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models for visual quality assessment rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, leading to shallow reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning with dual-branch reward formulation that separates intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For video quality assessment, uses global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5 VQA benchmarks under SRCC and PLCC metrics, with improvements of 5.30% and 2.15% respectively in IQA task, using only 6K images and 28K videos for reinforcement fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal perceptual cues underlying quality judgments, demonstrating both quantitative gains and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning about perceptual quality.

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

*Zicong Fan,Edoardo Remelli,David Dimond,Fadime Sener,Liuhao Ge,Bugra Tekin,Cem Keskin,Shreyas Hampali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PALM is a large-scale dataset of 13k hand scans from 263 subjects with 90k multi-view images, addressing the lack of diverse hand data for avatar creation. PALM-Net uses this data to enable realistic, relightable hand avatar personalization from single images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating high-quality personalized hand avatars from images is challenging due to complex geometry, appearance, and articulation under unconstrained lighting and limited views. Existing datasets lack accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution multiview imagery, and diverse subject populations.

Method: PALM dataset provides 13k hand scans from 263 subjects and 90k multi-view images capturing variation in skin tone, age, and geometry. PALM-Net learns a multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties via physically based inverse rendering.

Result: The dataset captures rich variation across 263 subjects and enables realistic, relightable single-image hand avatar personalization through the PALM-Net baseline model.

Conclusion: PALM's scale and diversity make it a valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research, addressing critical gaps in existing datasets for hand avatar creation.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

### [57] [Sharing the Learned Knowledge-base to Estimate Convolutional Filter Parameters for Continual Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05421)
*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual learning approach for image restoration that modifies convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous tasks without architectural changes, maintaining performance on existing tasks while improving new ones with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of continual learning in image restoration where existing methods require heavy architectural modifications and are unsuitable due to different restoration tasks requiring different feature processing.

Method: Proposes a simple modification of convolution layers to adapt knowledge from previous restoration tasks without changing the main backbone architecture, allowing seamless application to any deep architecture.

Result: Experimental validation shows the model can introduce new restoration tasks without compromising existing task performance, and new tasks improve by adapting knowledge from previous tasks, with minimal computational overhead increase.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective continual learning for image restoration without architectural modifications, demonstrating improved performance on new tasks while maintaining existing task performance with low computational cost.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

TL;DR: A text-to-talking-face framework that uses latent speech representations from HierSpeech++ to generate synchronized facial animations directly from text, achieving better lip-sync and realism than cascaded approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified framework that generates both speech and synchronized facial animations from text input, overcoming the limitations of cascaded pipelines and handling distribution shifts between clean and TTS-generated features.

Method: Two-stage training approach: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and finetuning on TTS outputs, with a Text-to-Vec module generating speech representations that jointly condition both speech and face generation.

Result: The method enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, produces natural expressive speech and synchronized facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference, and outperforms cascaded pipelines.

Conclusion: Conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features provides superior performance for text-to-talking-face synthesis compared to traditional cascaded approaches, improving both lip-sync accuracy and visual realism.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: gitmerge3D is a globally informed graph token merging method that reduces token count by 90-95% in 3D point cloud transformers while maintaining competitive performance, challenging the assumption that more tokens yield better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D point cloud transformers rely on dense token representations that incur high computational and memory costs, with tokens being remarkably redundant and leading to substantial inefficiency.

Method: Proposed gitmerge3D - a globally informed graph token merging method that significantly reduces token count while preserving performance.

Result: The method reduces token count by 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance across multiple 3D vision tasks, showing consistent improvements in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: This work challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance, revealing that current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability, providing insights for developing more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces xBD-S12 dataset for building damage assessment using medium-resolution Copernicus satellite imagery, showing that simple models outperform complex ones for generalization across disasters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid damage assessment for humanitarian response using widely available medium-resolution Earth observation data as a complement to limited very-high resolution imagery.

Method: Created xBD-S12 dataset with 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, spatially and temporally aligned with xBD benchmark. Conducted experiments comparing different model architectures for damage detection.

Result: Building damage can be detected and mapped effectively despite 10m resolution. Simple models generalize better to unseen disasters than complex architectures, and geospatial foundation models provide little practical benefit.

Conclusion: Copernicus medium-resolution imagery is viable for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and can complement VHR imagery. Dataset, code, and models are released to support further research.

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate photo dating system by utilizing facial information from multiple people in images, overcoming limitations of scene-based methods.

Method: Probabilistic framework combining modern face recognition, age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer photo capture year, with multi-face information aggregation.

Result: Aggregating evidence from multiple faces consistently improves performance, significantly outperforming scene-based baselines, especially for images with several identifiable individuals.

Conclusion: Multi-face information aggregation provides superior photo dating accuracy compared to traditional scene-based approaches, with the proposed probabilistic framework effectively leveraging facial evidence.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time flow regime classification framework using neuromorphic sensors that achieves 97.6% accuracy with 0.28ms processing time, outperforming conventional optical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow boiling is efficient for thermal management but sudden flow regime shifts disrupt performance. Conventional optical imaging has high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution for capturing transient behavior.

Method: Developed five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data from neuromorphic sensors, which detect brightness changes at individual pixels without full-frame reconstruction. Used an asynchronous processing pipeline with majority voting for stable output.

Result: Event-based models outperformed frame-based approaches due to sensitivity to dynamic flow features. The event-based LSTM model achieved 97.6% classification accuracy with 0.28ms processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed neuromorphic sensor-based framework enables reliable real-time flow regime monitoring with low latency, supporting experimental control and intelligent thermal management in flow boiling systems.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN is a lightweight medical image segmentation network that improves upon U-KAN by introducing grouped channel transformations, reducing complexity from O(C²) to O(C²/G) while achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image segmentation models face limitations: convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and transparency, while Transformers suffer from quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addressed some issues but has scalability limitations due to O(C²) complexity from full-channel transformations.

Method: GroupKAN introduces two novel structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform - partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings to reduce complexity, and (2) Grouped KAN Activation - applies shared spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient token-wise nonlinearity.

Result: On three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC), GroupKAN achieves average IoU of 79.80%, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11% while using only 47.6% of parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M), with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: GroupKAN successfully addresses the scalability limitations of U-KAN through grouped channel transformations, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and parameter count, making it a more practical solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance spatial awareness in VLMs using general architectures without extra overhead or harming general capabilities, aiming for human-like visuospatial abilities.

Method: Constructed VST-P dataset (4.1M samples across 19 spatial skills) and VST-R dataset (135K samples) for spatial reasoning. Used progressive training: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results: 34.8% on MMSI-Bench and 61.2% on VSIBench, with no negative impact on general capabilities.

Conclusion: VST framework significantly enhances spatial abilities in Vision-Language-Action models, paving the way for more physically grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

*Adrita Anika,Md Messal Monem Miah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies LLMs' ability to reconstruct globally ordered sequences from shuffled procedural steps using food recipes, finding performance declines with longer sequences and more severe shuffling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' capabilities in procedural reasoning where step order directly impacts outcomes, using food recipes as a critical domain where correct sequencing is essential.

Method: Evaluated several LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings on a curated dataset of food recipes, using metrics like Kendall's Tau, NLCS, and NED to measure ordering quality.

Result: Model performance declines with increasing sequence length and greater step displacement in input, showing limitations in handling longer and more disordered procedural sequences.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in procedural reasoning, particularly with longer sequences and more severely shuffled inputs, highlighting challenges in step ordering tasks.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ATLAS is an adaptive testing framework that uses Item Response Theory to efficiently evaluate large language models, achieving 90% item reduction while maintaining measurement precision compared to traditional static benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making evaluations expensive and slow, while treating all items equally despite varying quality and informativeness.

Method: Uses Item Response Theory (IRT) with Fisher information-guided item selection to adaptively estimate model ability, identifying and filtering out poorly performing items.

Result: Achieves 90% item reduction while maintaining precision (0.154 MAE on HellaSwag with only 42 items), reduces item exposure to <10% and test overlap to 16-27%, and reveals that 23-31% of models shift by >10 rank positions compared to accuracy-based rankings.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides a more efficient and accurate evaluation framework that reveals limitations in static benchmarks and enables better model differentiation through adaptive testing.

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).

### [68] [SARC: Sentiment-Augmented Deep Role Clustering for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04692)
*Jingqing Wang,Jiaxing Shang,Rong Xu,Fei Hao,Tianjin Huang,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SARC is a sentiment-augmented role clustering framework that improves fake news detection by identifying distinct user roles through sentiment-enhanced deep clustering and joint optimization of role clustering with fake news detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detection methods treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals without considering role differentiation - that the same sentiment polarity can come from users with different roles, limiting their ability to capture nuanced detection patterns.

Method: The framework generates user features through joint comment text representation (BiGRU with Attention) and sentiment encoding, constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to categorize user roles, and uses a joint optimization objective integrating role clustering with fake news detection.

Result: Experimental results on RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp datasets show SARC achieves superior performance across all metrics compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: SARC effectively addresses the limitation of existing approaches by incorporating role differentiation through sentiment-augmented clustering, demonstrating improved fake news detection performance through joint optimization of role identification and detection tasks.

Abstract: Fake news detection has been a long-standing research focus in social
networks. Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from
both news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,
existing approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,
overlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may
originate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to
capture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we
propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes
sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake
news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint
comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment
encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to
automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which
take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint
optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to
further improve the model performance. Experimental results on two benchmark
datasets, RumourEval-19 and Weibo-comp, demonstrate that SARC achieves superior
performance across all metrics compared to baseline models. The code is

*Zishuo Zheng,Vidhisha Balachandran,Chan Young Park,Faeze Brahman,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes VerIH, a dataset and training method to teach LLMs to resolve instruction hierarchies by treating it as a reasoning task, enabling models to prioritize system instructions over user inputs and improving robustness against attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs take on high-stakes decision-making roles, they need to reliably handle competing instructions from multiple sources (developers, users, tools) by enforcing instruction hierarchies for better reliability and controllability.

Method: Constructed VerIH dataset with aligned and conflicting system-user instructions, used lightweight reinforcement learning to transfer general reasoning capabilities to instruction prioritization, treating hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task.

Result: Finetuned models achieved consistent improvements on instruction following and hierarchy benchmarks, enhanced robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks by treating safety as conflict resolution between adversarial inputs and policies.

Conclusion: Reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs where system prompt updates yield controllable and robust behavior changes, demonstrating effective transfer of reasoning capabilities to instruction prioritization.

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,

*Song Wang,Zihan Chen,Peng Wang,Zhepei Wei,Zhen Tan,Yu Meng,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WinnowRAG is a novel RAG framework that addresses the noise problem in multi-document retrieval by using clustering and iterative winnowing to filter out irrelevant documents while preserving valuable content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems face challenges when retrieving more documents to increase relevance, as this introduces significant noise from irrelevant or misleading documents that reduces response accuracy.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage I performs query-aware clustering to group similar documents and assigns each cluster to an LLM agent for answer generation. Stage II uses a critic LLM to evaluate agent outputs and iteratively winnow useful documents from noisy ones, with strategic merging techniques to retain relevant knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate WinnowRAG's effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: WinnowRAG provides a model-agnostic solution that improves RAG performance by systematically filtering noise while preserving valuable content, without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge sources to address their limitations in
accessing up-to-date or specialized information. A natural strategy to increase
the likelihood of retrieving relevant information is to expand the number of
retrieved documents. However, involving more documents could introduce
significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby
reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the
challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose
WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy
documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as
winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware
clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each
cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage
II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of
multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To
retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic
merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for
generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does
not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks.
Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: To create a rigorous, systematic evaluation suite specifically designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for this domain.

Method: Constructed an extensive up-to-date bilingual policy corpus, designed three scenario-grounded tasks (Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, Compliance Judgment), and established a dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy rate.

Result: Evaluation of 10+ state-of-the-art LLMs revealed a clear performance hierarchy with reasoning models showing superior cross-task stability and accuracy. Successfully fine-tuned a lightweight open-source model that achieves parity with or surpasses proprietary baselines on multiple policy subtasks at significantly reduced cost.

Conclusion: POLIS-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs in policy scenarios, demonstrating that reasoning models excel in compliance tasks and that cost-effective fine-tuning can produce models competitive with proprietary alternatives for real-world governmental deployment.

Abstract: We introduce POLIS-Bench, the first rigorous, systematic evaluation suite
designed for LLMs operating in governmental bilingual policy scenarios.
Compared to existing benchmarks, POLIS-Bench introduces three major
advancements. (i) Up-to-date Bilingual Corpus: We construct an extensive,
up-to-date policy corpus that significantly scales the effective assessment
sample size, ensuring relevance to current governance practice. (ii)
Scenario-Grounded Task Design: We distill three specialized, scenario-grounded
tasks -- Clause Retrieval & Interpretation, Solution Generation, and the
Compliance Judgmen--to comprehensively probe model understanding and
application. (iii) Dual-Metric Evaluation Framework: We establish a novel
dual-metric evaluation framework combining semantic similarity with accuracy
rate to precisely measure both content alignment and task requirement
adherence. A large-scale evaluation of over 10 state-of-the-art LLMs on
POLIS-Bench reveals a clear performance hierarchy where reasoning models
maintain superior cross-task stability and accuracy, highlighting the
difficulty of compliance tasks. Furthermore, leveraging our benchmark, we
successfully fine-tune a lightweight open-source model. The resulting POLIS

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges previous findings that first layers are best for LLM influence estimation, showing middle attention layers are better and proposing improved aggregation methods and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training sample influence estimation in LLMs by addressing unreliable cancellation effects and developing better layer selection and aggregation methods.

Method: Proposed theoretical and empirical analysis of cancellation effect unreliability, identified middle attention layers as better influence estimators, developed alternative aggregation methods (ranking and vote-based), and introduced Noise Detection Rate (NDR) metric.

Result: Demonstrated that first layers are not necessarily better than last layers for influence estimation, middle attention layers perform better, and new aggregation methods significantly improve performance across various LLM types and scales.

Conclusion: Contrasts prior knowledge by showing first layers aren't superior for influence estimation, establishes middle attention layers as better estimators, and provides improved evaluation methods and metrics for LLM influence analysis.

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

Motivation: Rare diseases in medical imaging often cause AI model failures due to scarce training data, similar to how radiologists consult literature when encountering unfamiliar findings.

Method: Uses AI agents with sentence transformers to embed case reports and literature, indexes them with FAISS for efficient similarity search, and retrieves clinically relevant evidence to guide diagnostic decisions without additional training.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented reasoning is a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence conditions in medical imaging, improving rare pathology recognition and interpretability across diverse LLMs.

Abstract: Rare diseases represent the long tail of medical imaging, where AI models
often fail due to the scarcity of representative training data. In clinical
workflows, radiologists frequently consult case reports and literature when
confronted with unfamiliar findings. Following this line of reasoning, we
introduce RADAR, Retrieval Augmented Diagnostic Reasoning Agents, an agentic
system for rare disease detection in brain MRI. Our approach uses AI agents
with access to external medical knowledge by embedding both case reports and
literature using sentence transformers and indexing them with FAISS to enable
efficient similarity search. The agent retrieves clinically relevant evidence
to guide diagnostic decision making on unseen diseases, without the need of
additional training. Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can
be seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently
improving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA
dataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%
performance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source
models such as DeepSeek. Beyond accuracy, the retrieved examples provide
interpretable, literature grounded explanations, highlighting
retrieval-augmented reasoning as a powerful paradigm for low-prevalence

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces surprisal variance as a metric for linguistic diversity in image captioning, showing that human captions have roughly twice the diversity of models when measured with caption-trained LMs, but this pattern reverses with general-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning and address the limitations of current evaluation methods that may give contradictory conclusions depending on the scorer used.

Method: The authors propose surprisal variance - the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within caption sets. They compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs with human captions on MSCOCO test set, using both greedy and nucleus sampling decoding.

Result: When measured with a caption-trained n-gram LM, human captions show roughly twice the surprisal variance of models. However, rescoring with a general-language model reverses this pattern, completely inverting the conclusions.

Conclusion: Robust diversity evaluation in image captioning must report surprisal under several scorers, as relying on a single scorer can lead to completely opposite conclusions about which captions are more diverse.

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ERPO framework addresses the problem of residual prompts (zero variance rewards) in RLVR training by encouraging exploration through adaptive temperature increases, reviving training signals and improving model performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs train longer and scale larger, more prompts become residual prompts with zero variance rewards, reducing training diversity and effectiveness. Current methods like GRPO fail to fully utilize these residual prompts.

Method: ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses, encouraging generation of more diverse reasoning traces with incorrect responses to revive training signals.

Result: Empirical results on Qwen2.5 series show ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ERPO effectively exploits residual prompts in RLVR training through exploration-based reactivation, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: Base LLMs exhibit semantic calibration in open-domain QA tasks without explicit training, but RL instruction-tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning break this calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether base LLMs can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond token-level calibration, and to establish a theoretical mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges.

Method: Proposed B-calibration framework parameterized by equivalence classes, leveraging connection between calibration and local loss optimality. Conducted experiments to validate theoretical predictions about semantic calibration.

Result: Base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated semantically in QA tasks. RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks calibration. Chain-of-thought reasoning also breaks calibration.

Conclusion: Semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction in base LLMs, providing the first principled explanation of when and why this phenomenon occurs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

### [82] [Minimal and Mechanistic Conditions for Behavioral Self-Awareness in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04875)
*Matthew Bozoukov,Matthew Nguyen,Shubkarman Singh,Bart Bussmann,Patrick Leask*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can develop behavioral self-awareness through minimal interventions, using just a single rank-1 LoRA adapter, and this capability manifests as linear features in activation space that are domain-specific rather than universal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the minimal conditions for LLMs to develop behavioral self-awareness and the safety concerns this raises, particularly regarding models potentially concealing their true abilities during evaluations.

Method: Conducted controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs using low-rank adapters (LoRA), specifically testing with single rank-1 LoRA adapters and analyzing activation space representations.

Result: Found that self-awareness can be reliably induced with minimal intervention, is captured by single steering vectors in activation space, and manifests as non-universal, domain-localized representations across different tasks.

Conclusion: Behavioral self-awareness in LLMs emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated, suggesting it's a fundamental but localized capability rather than a universal property.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

### [83] [SDS KoPub VDR: A Benchmark Dataset for Visual Document Retrieval in Korean Public Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04910)
*Jaehoon Lee,Sohyun Kim,Wanggeun Park,Geon Lee,Seungkyung Kim,Minyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDS KoPub VDR is the first large-scale benchmark for Korean public document retrieval, featuring 361 real-world documents (40,781 pages) with complex visual elements and 600 human-verified query-page-answer triples across six domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VDR benchmarks overlook non-English languages and structural complexity of official publications, creating a critical gap for evaluating document retrieval systems in real-world multilingual contexts.

Method: Built a corpus of 361 real Korean public documents with complex visual elements, created 600 query-page-answer triples using multimodal models followed by rigorous human verification, and established evaluation across text-only and multimodal retrieval tasks.

Result: The benchmark reveals substantial performance gaps in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models, highlighting limitations in current document retrieval systems.

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR provides a foundational resource for rigorous evaluation of multimodal AI in complex document intelligence and offers a clear roadmap for advancing cross-modal reasoning capabilities in real-world applications.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

*Chandra Vamsi Krishna Alla,Harish Naidu Gaddam,Manohar Kommi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BudgetMem is a memory-augmented architecture that selectively stores information under budget constraints, achieving near-baseline performance with 72.4% memory savings on long documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face computational and memory constraints when processing long contexts, with existing approaches being prohibitively expensive for resource-constrained deployments.

Method: Combines selective memory policies with feature-based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) and learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval.

Result: Achieves only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG on long documents (5K-10K tokens), with benefits increasing with document length.

Conclusion: Provides a practical pathway for deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access to advanced language understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

*Yu Li,Lehui Li,Qingmin Liao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for baseline and dataset recommendation in AI research that addresses limitations of prior methods by leveraging collective perception from citation networks and incorporating reasoning-augmented reranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for automated experiment design suffer from limited data coverage (missing datasets actually used in published papers) and overreliance on content similarity that overlooks experimental suitability. The authors aim to create a more reliable and interpretable system for automating experimental design.

Method: 1) Automated data-collection pipeline linking 100K accepted papers to their actual baselines and datasets; 2) Collective perception enhanced retriever that represents datasets/baselines using self-descriptions plus aggregated citation contexts; 3) Reasoning-augmented reranker that constructs explicit reasoning chains and finetunes an LLM for interpretable justifications and refined rankings.

Result: The curated dataset covers 85% of datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences over 5 years. The method outperforms strongest prior baseline with +5.85% in Recall@20 and +8.30% in HitRate@5.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances reliable, interpretable automation of experimental design by addressing key limitations of prior approaches through comprehensive data collection and sophisticated retrieval/reranking techniques.

Abstract: Large language model agents are becoming increasingly capable at web-centric
tasks such as information retrieval, complex reasoning. These emerging
capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM
agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is
to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval.
However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation
datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many
datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content
similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks
experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the
baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for
baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated
data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted
papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a
collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each
dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates
self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient
candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations.
Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction
chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language
model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset
we curated covers 85\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences
over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the
strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\% in Recall@20, +8.30\% in
HitRate@5. Taken together, our results advance reliable, interpretable
automation of experimental design.

*Shixiong Zhao,Hideaki Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes taxonomic inconsistencies in Wikidata, proposes a validation method to identify classification errors and redundant connections, and develops a system for users to inspect and correct these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata's open editing policy has led to taxonomic inconsistencies despite its value as a large open knowledge graph, creating a need for systematic validation and correction methods.

Method: Proposes a novel validation method to detect classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific Wikidata domains, along with an evaluation criterion for determining correction necessity.

Result: The study confirms the presence of taxonomic inconsistencies in Wikidata and develops a user system for inspecting entity relationships, leveraging Wikidata's crowdsourced nature.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively identifies and addresses taxonomic issues in Wikidata while utilizing its collaborative editing model for continuous improvement.

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

*Wei Shao,Lingchao Zheng,Pengyu Wang,Peizhen Zheng,Jun Li,Yuwei Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoPT is a lossless parallel tokenization framework that addresses boundary artifacts in existing parallel tokenization methods, ensuring identical output to sequential tokenization while achieving significant speedup for long context inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long context inference introduces computational latency, and while prior research has optimized various aspects, tokenization remains an overlooked bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods suffer from inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts after merging.

Method: The approach employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment to accurately align and merge tokenized segments, ensuring lossless parallel tokenization.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup while guaranteeing lossless tokenization identical to standard sequential tokenization.

Conclusion: LoPT provides a robust solution for parallel tokenization with theoretical proof of consistency and comprehensive analytical studies validating its effectiveness in long context inference scenarios.

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

*Zihao Yi,Qingxuan Jiang,Ruotian Ma,Xingyu Chen,Qu Yang,Mengru Wang,Fanghua Ye,Ying Shen,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li,Linus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to authentically role-play villainous characters due to safety alignment, showing declining fidelity as character morality decreases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLM safety alignment conflicts with authentic role-playing of morally ambiguous or villainous characters in creative generation tasks.

Method: Created Moral RolePlay benchmark with four-level moral alignment scale and balanced test set, then evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains.

Result: Models show consistent decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases, struggling most with traits antithetical to safety principles like deceitfulness and manipulation, often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental tension between model safety and creative fidelity, with safety-aligned models performing poorly at villain role-playing, highlighting the need for more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

*Ya Wang,Guangzheng Zhu,Cungen Cao,Jingjing Li,He Li,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to automatically acquire common Chinese emotional events using LLMs and filtering techniques, resulting in a large-scale knowledge base of 102,218 high-quality emotional events with sentiment labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotional events are important for various applications but are difficult to acquire, especially context-independent common emotional events in Chinese language.

Method: Collect Chinese emotional event indicators, generate events using LLM prompting, train a filter to discard invalid results, and classify events as positive/negative using different techniques.

Result: Created a knowledge base of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment polarity labels - the only large-scale commonsense emotional event resource in Chinese.

Conclusion: The method effectively acquires common Chinese emotional events and shows strong potential for applications like emotion cause extraction. Resources will be publicly released.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

*Prasoon Varshney,Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar,Liwei Jiang,Traian Rebedea,Christopher Parisien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBSUITE is an evaluation framework that tests LLMs' ability to follow diverse organizational policies in multi-turn conversations, revealing that current models fail significantly under adversarial conditions despite good single-turn performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM applications occur within organizational contexts with specific policies, regulations, and ethical commitments, but current alignment methods focus on universal safety principles rather than pluralistic adaptation to diverse user values.

Method: Developed PBSUITE with 300 realistic behavioral policies across 30 industries and a dynamic evaluation framework that stress-tests model compliance through adversarial multi-turn conversations.

Result: Leading LLMs show strong policy adherence in single-turn settings (<4% failure rates) but suffer substantial compliance degradation in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods are insufficient for enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world interactions, highlighting the need for robust, context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

TL;DR: UA-Code-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' code generation and competitive programming abilities in Ukrainian, using 500 problems from Eolymp across 5 difficulty levels. Evaluation shows even top models solve only half the problems, highlighting challenges in low-resource language code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding, creating a gap in evaluating LLMs' real capabilities in low-resource languages like Ukrainian.

Method: Created UA-Code-Bench with 500 Eolymp problems across 5 complexity levels. Evaluated 13 leading proprietary and open-source models generating Python solutions via one-shot prompting, tested in dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests.

Result: Even top-performing models (OpenAI o3 and GPT-5) solved only half of the problems. Comprehensive analysis showed performance variations across difficulty levels, solution uniqueness, and computational efficiency metrics (time and memory consumption).

Conclusion: Competitive programming benchmarks are valuable for evaluating LLMs, especially in underrepresented languages. This work paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models.

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating
large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves
the way for future research on multilingual code generation and
reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code

*Jinglin Liang,Jin Zhong,Shuangping Huang,Yunqing Hu,Huiyuan Zhang,Huifang Li,Lixin Fan,Hanlin Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Order-Level Attention (OLA) and shows that attention patterns across different language models share significant similarities, enabling cross-model knowledge transfer through a training-free adapter method called TOA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore commonalities in context aggregation patterns across multiple language models, which previous work has neglected by focusing on individual models or attention heads.

Method: Introduces Order-Level Attention (OLA) from attention rollout decomposition, discovers OLA-syntax mapping, and proposes Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA) - a training-free cross-model adapter that uses OLA as unified syntactic features.

Result: OLA at the same order across different LMs shows significant similarities, and TOA effectively enhances performance of unseen LMs without parameter updates through cross-LM generalization.

Conclusion: The discovered OLA commonalities enable effective cross-model knowledge transfer, and TOA provides a practical training-free method for improving LM performance through shared syntactic feature representations.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

*P. Bilha Githinji,Aikaterini Meilliou,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates two LLMs (Mistral 24B and QWen2.5 32B) for biomedical text simplification, finding that instruction-tuned Mistral better balances readability and discourse fidelity compared to reasoning-augmented QWen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing public consumption of biomedical information requires scalable solutions for automatically adapting complex scientific documents into plain language, as current text simplification methods struggle to balance readability with content preservation.

Method: Comparative analysis of instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B using multiple metrics including SARI for simplification quality and BERTScore for discourse fidelity, with comprehensive correlation analysis across 21 metrics.

Result: Mistral achieved better balance with SARI score of 42.46 and BERTScore of 0.91, while QWen showed disconnect between readability and accuracy with significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Strong functional redundancies were found among five readability indices.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned Mistral 24B is identified as superior for text simplification, with lexical support identified as a key domain-adaptation issue, providing baseline performance tracking and metric selection heuristics for evolving LLMs.

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

### [95] [Iterative Layer-wise Distillation for Efficient Compression of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05085)
*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an improved distillation method for LLMs that reduces model size while preserving performance through iterative layer importance evaluation and joint loss training, achieving 28-layer (2.47B parameter) model with only 9.7% quality loss from original 36-layer Qwen2.5-3B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop compact LLMs that maintain high performance for deployment in resource-limited settings, addressing the need for efficient models while overcoming limitations of existing distillation approaches.

Method: Improved ShortGPT approach with iterative layer importance assessment (measuring performance degradation when removing layers) combined with training using joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.

Result: Successfully reduced Qwen2.5-3B from 36 to 28 layers (2.47B parameters) with 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with 18% loss, showing middle transformer layers contribute less to inference.

Conclusion: The proposed iterative distillation and fine-tuning method effectively creates efficient models suitable for resource-constrained environments, demonstrating the potential of layer importance evaluation for model compression.

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: This paper proposes improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization for LLMs, including decomposition of evolution steps, LLM-based verification, human feedback integration, and efficient evaluation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evolutionary prompt optimization approaches lack robust operators and efficient evaluation mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness and practical application.

Method: The method involves: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps for better control, 2) using an LLM-based judge to verify evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine evolutionary operators, and 4) developing efficient evaluation strategies to reduce computational overhead.

Result: The proposed approach improves both optimization quality and efficiency in prompt optimization for LLMs.

Conclusion: The improvements can partially generalize to prompt optimization in general, and the released code enables prompt optimization on new tasks while facilitating further research in this area.

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

*Robin Armingaud,Romaric Besançon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ManufactuBERT is a RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale, deduplicated manufacturing corpus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on manufacturing NLP tasks while reducing training time by 33% through effective deduplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose Transformer encoders perform poorly in specialized domains like manufacturing due to lack of domain-specific terminology and semantics exposure.

Method: Developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline with domain-specific filtering and multi-stage deduplication to create a manufacturing corpus, then continually pretrained RoBERTa on this corpus.

Result: ManufactuBERT establishes new state-of-the-art on manufacturing NLP tasks and training on deduplicated corpus reduces training time and computational cost by 33% compared to non-deduplicated dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a reproducible approach for developing high-performing encoders in specialized domains, with the model and corpus being publicly released.

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

*Cong-Thanh Do,Rama Doddipatla,Kate Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves knowledge distillation from larger to smaller LLMs, showing that CoT data enhances reasoning capability transfer and boosts performance on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting in knowledge distillation for transferring reasoning capabilities from larger to smaller language models, addressing the challenge of complex reasoning tasks for smaller models.

Method: Conducted white-box knowledge distillation experiments using LLMs from Qwen and Llama2 families, employing CoT data from CoT-Collection dataset, and evaluated distilled models on BIG-Bench-Hard benchmark tasks.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that CoT improves white-box knowledge distillation effectiveness, enabling distilled models to achieve better average performance on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from BBH.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought plays a crucial role in enhancing knowledge distillation by effectively transferring reasoning capabilities from larger to smaller language models, improving their performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

*Zilong Li,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the low-resource problem of translating classical Chinese to Japanese using character-level annotation, proposing an LLM-based pipeline and dataset construction from digitalized translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to modernize the traditional method of translating classical Chinese to Japanese through character annotation, which faces low-resource challenges in contemporary language technologies.

Method: Introduces an LLM-based annotation pipeline and constructs a dataset from digitalized open-source translation data. Uses auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks to enhance sequence tagging model training in low-resource settings.

Result: Auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks improve sequence tagging performance under low-resource conditions. LLMs achieve high scores in direct machine translation but struggle with character annotation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method serves as a valuable supplement to LLMs, particularly for character-level annotation tasks where LLMs show limitations, effectively addressing the low-resource translation problem.

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

### [100] [Reflective Personalization Optimization: A Post-hoc Rewriting Framework for Black-Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05286)
*Teqi Hao,Xioayu Tan,Shaojie Shi,Yinghui Xu,Xihe Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPO is a two-stage personalization framework that decouples content generation from alignment, using a reflection module to rewrite generic responses to match user preferences, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM personalization methods rely on context injection, forcing models to simultaneously handle content generation and style alignment, which compromises output quality and control.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Base model generates generic response, 2) Reflection module rewrites output to align with user preferences using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on LaMP benchmark show RPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by decoupling content generation from personalization.

Conclusion: Explicit response shaping through decoupled stages is superior to implicit context injection, providing an efficient model-agnostic personalization layer for user-centric generation.

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

### [101] [Listening Between the Lines: Decoding Podcast Narratives with Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05310)
*Shreya Gupta,Ojasva Saxena,Arghodeep Nandi,Sarah Masud,Kiran Garimella,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a fine-tuned BERT model for analyzing narrative frames in podcasts, addressing the limitations of existing LLMs in handling conversational data by grounding frames to specific entities and correlating them with topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Podcasts are important for understanding public discourse but their unscripted, conversational nature makes automated analysis challenging. Existing language models trained on structured text struggle to capture narrative frames in podcasts.

Method: Developed a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in conversations, then correlates these granular frame labels with high-level topics to reveal discourse trends.

Result: The approach provides a novel frame-labeling methodology that better aligns with human judgment for conversational data and uncovers systematic relationships between topics and presentation frames.

Conclusion: The paper offers a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media by effectively analyzing how podcasts persuade and inform through their narrative structures.

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

*Klára Bendová,Tomáš Knap,Jan Černý,Vojtěch Pour,Jaromir Savelka,Ivana Kvapilíková,Jakub Drápal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that criminal behavior descriptions can be effectively extracted from Slovak court verdicts using both advanced regular expressions (97% success) and LLMs (98.75% success), with a combined approach achieving 99.5% success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize the rich information about criminal offenses contained in court verdicts, which is currently unused in criminal justice administrative data systems.

Method: Used two approaches: (1) Regular expressions (baseline and advanced versions focusing on 'sparing' patterns), and (2) Large language models (Gemini Flash 2.0) with predefined instructions for extraction.

Result: Advanced methods significantly outperformed baseline (40.5%): advanced regex achieved 97%, LLMs 98.75%, and combined approach 99.5%. Human evaluation showed 90% match with human annotations for advanced methods vs 34.5% for baseline.

Conclusion: Both advanced regular expressions and LLMs are highly effective for extracting criminal behavior descriptions from court verdicts, with LLMs performing slightly better and the combined approach achieving near-perfect results.

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

*Firoj Ahmmed Patwary,Abdullah Al Noman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BengaliBPE is a specialized Byte Pair Encoding tokenizer for Bengali that outperforms general-purpose tokenizers by using Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules, achieving better morphological interpretability and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or HuggingFace BPE are designed for Latin/multilingual corpora and perform poorly on morphologically rich languages like Bengali, creating a need for language-specific tokenization.

Method: Developed BengaliBPE with Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules. Compared it against Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE using a large Bengali news classification dataset.

Result: BengaliBPE provides the most detailed segmentation and best morphological interpretability, though with slightly higher computational cost. All methods performed reasonably well on downstream classification.

Conclusion: Language-aware tokenization is crucial for morphologically rich scripts, and BengaliBPE establishes a strong foundation for future Bengali NLP systems including large-scale pretraining of language models.

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual
language models.

*Maria Huynh,Wilder C. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research proposal studies how heritage languages influence additional language acquisition using a multilayer network model of the mental lexicon, incorporating visual inputs to examine their effect on translation task performance compared to text-only conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual mental lexicons are structured and how heritage languages influence additional language acquisition, particularly investigating whether visual input affects translation proficiency and accuracy.

Method: Extends previous multiplex mental lexicon models by adding multimodality - incorporating visual inputs connected to lexical representations across multilingual layers, using the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework and multilayer network principles.

Result: The abstract presents a research proposal rather than completed results, focusing on experimental design to test whether visual input in translation tasks affects proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions.

Conclusion: The study aims to advance understanding of multilingual mental lexicon architecture and the role of visual input in language processing across multiple languages.

Abstract: Historically, bilingualism was often perceived as an additional cognitive
load that could hinder linguistic and intellectual development. However, over
the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies
have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word
recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel
activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll
et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals
who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in
various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language
Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of
the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak
multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who
investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental
lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by
Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer
network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design
extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex
model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their
corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the
mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language
influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the
presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants'
proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?

TL;DR: RAGRecon is a cybersecurity threat intelligence system that combines LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer threat-related questions and provides explainable AI through visual knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security mechanisms struggle with complex cyber threats, while LLMs offer advanced text processing capabilities but lack transparency in cybersecurity applications.

Method: The system uses LLMs with RAG to combine real-time information retrieval with domain-specific cybersecurity data, and generates visual knowledge graphs to explain the AI's reasoning process.

Result: Experimental evaluation with two datasets and seven LLMs showed response accuracy exceeding 91% for the best model combinations.

Conclusion: RAGRecon successfully demonstrates that LLMs with RAG can provide accurate threat intelligence while maintaining explainability through visual knowledge graphs, enhancing transparency for cybersecurity analysts.

Abstract: As cyber threats continue to grow in complexity, traditional security
mechanisms struggle to keep up. Large language models (LLMs) offer significant
potential in cybersecurity due to their advanced capabilities in text
processing and generation. This paper explores the use of LLMs with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to obtain threat intelligence by combining
real-time information retrieval with domain-specific data. The proposed system,
RAGRecon, uses a LLM with RAG to answer questions about cybersecurity threats.
Moreover, it makes this form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) explainable by
generating and visually presenting to the user a knowledge graph for every
reply. This increases the transparency and interpretability of the reasoning of
the model, allowing analysts to better understand the connections made by the
system based on the context recovered by the RAG system. We evaluated RAGRecon
experimentally with two datasets and seven different LLMs and the responses
matched the reference responses more than 91% of the time for the best
combinations.

### [106] [Minority-Aware Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue Systems via Preference-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05407)
*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified framework for user satisfaction estimation that models both individual and group-level preferences using personalized reasoning chains and unsupervised clustering, achieving better performance especially for minority users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue systems use one-size-fits-all models that overlook minority perspectives and individual preferences, leading to biased user satisfaction estimation.

Method: Proposes Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) for individual preferences, Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) for group discovery, and PAda-PPO reinforcement learning framework for joint optimization.

Result: Experiments on Emotional Support Conversation dataset show consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation, particularly benefiting underrepresented user groups.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing alignment methods by modeling both individual and group preferences, leading to more equitable and accurate user satisfaction estimation.

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [107] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Contrastive weight steering is a post-training method that edits LLM parameters using weight arithmetic to isolate behavior directions, enabling better behavioral control while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage narrow training data more effectively and avoid unintended generalizations, since providing high-quality feedback on diverse distributions is difficult and expensive.

Method: Isolate behavior directions in weight-space by subtracting weight deltas from two small fine-tunes (one inducing desired behavior, another its opposite), then add/remove this direction to modify model weights.

Result: Weight steering generalizes better than activation steering, achieves stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading capabilities, and can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals while preserving task performance gains.

Conclusion: Weight steering enables effective behavioral control and can detect emergent misalignment by measuring similarity between fine-tuning updates and "evil" weight directions, allowing monitoring of rare misaligned behaviors.

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

*Yuexin Wu,Shiqi Wang,Vasile Rus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset from EHR discharge notes aligned with WHO ICD-11 terminology, and presents LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that outperforms baseline methods by isolating semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disease diagnosis is crucial for healthcare, and self-reports preserve clinically important signals that EHR documentation often misses. There's a need to operationalize this shift by creating better diagnostic datasets and methods.

Method: Created MIMIC-SR-ICD11 dataset from EHR discharge notes aligned with ICD-11 terminology. Developed LL-Rank framework that computes length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given clinical context and subtracts report-free prior likelihood.

Result: LL-Rank consistently outperformed the GenMap baseline across seven model backbones. Ablation experiments showed gains primarily come from PMI-based scoring that isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages self-report information for diagnostic tasks and demonstrates superior performance through semantic-focused scoring that reduces frequency bias.

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates

### [109] [DAFM: Dynamic Adaptive Fusion for Multi-Model Collaboration in Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05020)
*Yawei Cai,Jiapeng Mi,Nan Ji,Haotian Rong,Yawei Zhang,Zhangti Li,Wenbin Guo,Rensong Xie*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for composed image retrieval, using multi-model collaboration to dynamically balance complementary model strengths and improve retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-model approaches for composed image retrieval struggle with handling both global context and fine details simultaneously, and lack dynamic weight allocation to leverage complementary model strengths effectively.

Method: DAFM framework for multi-model collaboration that adaptively rebalances contributions from heterogeneous models, ensuring performance gains are independent of fusion order.

Result: Achieves Recall@10 of 93.21 and Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing baselines by up to 4.5%.

Conclusion: Dynamic multi-model collaboration provides an effective and general solution for composed image retrieval, demonstrating robustness and consistent performance improvements.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a cross-modal task that aims to retrieve
target images from large-scale databases using a reference image and a
modification text. Most existing methods rely on a single model to perform
feature fusion and similarity matching. However, this paradigm faces two major
challenges. First, one model alone can't see the whole picture and the tiny
details at the same time; it has to handle different tasks with the same
weights, so it often misses the small but important links between image and
text. Second, the absence of dynamic weight allocation prevents adaptive
leveraging of complementary model strengths, so the resulting embedding drifts
away from the target and misleads the nearest-neighbor search in CIR. To
address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (DAFM) for
multi-model collaboration in CIR. Rather than optimizing a single method in
isolation, DAFM exploits the complementary strengths of heterogeneous models
and adaptively rebalances their contributions. This not only maximizes
retrieval accuracy but also ensures that the performance gains are independent
of the fusion order, highlighting the robustness of our approach. Experiments
on the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements. Our
method achieves a Recall@10 of 93.21 and an Rmean of 84.43 on CIRR, and an
average Rmean of 67.48 on FashionIQ, surpassing recent strong baselines by up
to 4.5%. These results confirm that dynamic multi-model collaboration provides
an effective and general solution for CIR.

*Benjamin Kahl,Marcus Hebel,Michael Arens*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of traditional (point clouds, voxels, meshes) vs. modern neural methods (NeRFs, 3DGS) for geospatial sensor data, revealing trade-off between geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, with proposed hybrid approach combining mesh scaffolds with neural representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geospatial sensor data from lidar and cameras provides essential 3D information for defense and security situational awareness, requiring effective representation methods for creating detailed operational environment models.

Method: Comparative evaluation of traditional representation methods (point clouds, voxel grids, triangle meshes) versus modern neural/implicit techniques (Neural Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussian Splatting) for geospatial data.

Result: Traditional models provide robust geometric accuracy suitable for functional tasks like line-of-sight analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods produce high-fidelity photorealistic visuals but lack geometric reliability.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach combining traditional mesh scaffolds for geometric integrity with neural representations like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within hierarchical scene structure for scalability and performance, is the most promising path forward.

Abstract: Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering
indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered
from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of
detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a
comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point
clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit
techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models
offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight
analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing
high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability.
Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most
promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a
traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation
like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to
ensure scalability and performance.

TL;DR: Integration of smoothing B-splines into differentiable vector graphics pipeline for generating smooth, long paths in deep learning systems with parametric control over fidelity-simplicity tradeoffs and stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generation of smooth and arbitrarily long vector paths within image-based deep learning systems while providing control over fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs and stylization in both geometric and image spaces.

Method: Integrate smoothing B-splines into standard differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG) pipeline through linear mapping, using derivative-based smoothing costs for parametric control, and maintain compatibility with existing vector graphics generation and vectorization methods.

Result: Successfully demonstrated versatile applications including stylized space-filling path generation, stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized text generation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively enables smooth vector path generation with controllable fidelity-simplicity tradeoffs and stylization, compatible with modern vector graphics methods and applicable to various stylized vector graphics generation tasks.

Abstract: We integrate smoothing B-splines into a standard differentiable vector
graphics (DiffVG) pipeline through linear mapping, and show how this can be
used to generate smooth and arbitrarily long paths within image-based deep
learning systems. We take advantage of derivative-based smoothing costs for
parametric control of fidelity vs. simplicity tradeoffs, while also enabling
stylization control in geometric and image spaces. The proposed pipeline is
compatible with recent vector graphics generation and vectorization methods. We
demonstrate the versatility of our approach with four applications aimed at the
generation of stylized vector graphics: stylized space-filling path generation,
stroke-based image abstraction, closed-area image abstraction, and stylized
text generation.

### [113] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an epistemic reject-option predictor that abstains from predictions in regions of high epistemic uncertainty caused by insufficient training data, using a Bayesian learning framework to minimize expected regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reject-option methods only consider aleatoric uncertainty, assuming large training data makes epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in practical scenarios with limited data, this assumption is unrealistic, requiring a framework that addresses epistemic uncertainty.

Method: The approach builds on Bayesian learning and redefines the optimal predictor as one that minimizes expected regret - the performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when regret exceeds a specified rejection cost.

Result: The paper presents the first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable decisions.

Conclusion: The epistemic reject-option predictor provides a systematic way to handle uncertainty in practical scenarios with limited data by explicitly accounting for epistemic uncertainty through regret minimization.

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

### [114] [DMA: Online RAG Alignment with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04880)
*Yu Bai,Yukai Miao,Dawei Wang,Li Chen,Fei Long,Rundi Zhai,Dan Li,Yanyu Ren,Tianfeng Liu,Hongtao Xie,Ce Yang,Xuhui Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Memory Alignment (DMA) is an online learning framework that uses multi-granularity human feedback to adapt retrieval-augmented generation systems in real-time, improving ranking alignment while maintaining baseline performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems use static retrieval that cannot adapt to evolving user intent and content drift, limiting their effectiveness in interactive settings.

Method: DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level feedback into a learning pipeline with supervised training for pointwise/listwise rankers, policy optimization using response preferences, and knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency deployment.

Result: Online deployment showed substantial improvements in human engagement, while offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks (TriviaQA, HotpotQA) demonstrated competitive foundational retrieval with notable gains in conversational QA.

Conclusion: DMA provides a principled approach for feedback-driven real-time adaptation in RAG systems without sacrificing baseline capabilities, enabling dynamic alignment to user needs.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

*Yule Wen,Yixin Ye,Yanzhe Zhang,Diyi Yang,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces real-time reasoning as a new problem for AI agents in dynamic environments, showing current language models struggle with timely judgments. It proposes AgileThinker, which combines reactive and planning reasoning paradigms to balance reasoning depth and response latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world agents need to make both logical and timely judgments in dynamic environments where hazards emerge and opportunities arise while reasoning is still ongoing. Current language model approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature.

Method: The authors introduce real-time reasoning problem formulation and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym. They study two paradigms: reactive agents (bounded computation for rapid responses) and planning agents (extended computation for complex problems). They propose AgileThinker which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms.

Result: Experiments show state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. AgileThinker consistently outperforms single-paradigm agents as task difficulty and time pressure increase, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency.

Conclusion: The work establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for practical agents and provides a foundation for temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Abstract: Agents in the real world must make not only logical but also timely
judgments. This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:
hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's
reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,
existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce
real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving
environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two
paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which
employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,
and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex
problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with
making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this
limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both
reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only
one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,
effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work
establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical
agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI
systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A methodology for generating and evaluating military courses of action for mechanized battalions, using concurrent generation and evaluation processes to produce superior alternatives based on opponent status and battlefield conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support decision-making during military ground combat operations by systematically generating and evaluating various courses of action for mechanized battalions.

Method: Systematically generates thousands of individual action alternatives and evaluates them based on opponent status, unit composition, force ratios, offense/defense types, and advance rates using field manuals. Uses concurrent generation and evaluation processes within a sequential decision-making framework.

Result: Produces a variety of alternative courses of action with superior outcomes, enabling management of new course generation based on previously evaluated actions.

Conclusion: The methodology facilitates dynamic decision-making by generating revised courses of action as combat conditions evolve, providing commanders with continuously updated recommendations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents show promise for cleaning maintenance logs in predictive maintenance pipelines, effectively handling generic noise types while domain-specific errors remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic constraints, limited datasets, and expertise shortages hinder predictive maintenance adoption in automotive sector; LLMs offer opportunity to overcome these barriers and accelerate industrial implementation.

Method: Evaluated LLM-based agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise in maintenance logs, including typos, missing fields, near-duplicates, and incorrect dates.

Result: LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and provide promising foundation for industrial applications, though domain-specific errors remain challenging.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents show potential for predictive maintenance cleaning pipelines, with opportunities for further improvement through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

### [118] [Reasoning Is All You Need for Urban Planning AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05375)
*Sijie Yang,Jiatong Li,Filip Biljecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework that integrates reasoning AI capabilities for urban planning decisions, combining cognitive layers and logic components through multi-agent collaboration to augment human planners with transparent, value-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI excels at pattern recognition in urban planning but lacks reasoning capabilities for decision-making. The next frontier is AI-assisted decision-making that can recommend sites, allocate resources, and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and stakeholder values.

Method: The framework integrates three cognitive layers (Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis, Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a multi-agent collaboration framework, enabling value-based, rule-grounded, and explainable reasoning.

Result: The framework demonstrates that planning decisions require explicit reasoning capabilities that statistical learning alone cannot fulfill, and shows how AI agents can systematically explore solution spaces, verify regulatory compliance, and deliberate over trade-offs transparently.

Conclusion: AI agents can augment human planners by amplifying human judgment with computational reasoning capabilities, rather than replacing human decision-making, through transparent reasoning about constraints and stakeholder values.

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.
