Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions.

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our\nmodel is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully\ndistilled into the sender.", "AI": {"tldr": "NegoCollab proposes a negotiated common representation approach for heterogeneous collaborative perception, addressing domain gaps between different agents' models through a negotiator that creates a common representation space with reduced inherent domain gaps.", "motivation": "Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception causes domain gaps in shared features between agents using different fixed perception models, degrading performance.
