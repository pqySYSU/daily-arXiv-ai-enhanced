### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a Vision-Language-Action model with a dual-level action representation framework that combines latent actions from manipulation videos and structured discrete action tokens, achieving competitive performance on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive VLA model that can effectively bridge vision, language, and action representations for robotic manipulation tasks through novel training strategies and action representation frameworks.

Method: Uses a latent action model trained on human/robotic videos, dual-level action representation (latent actions + discrete action tokens), and mixed training combining robot trajectory data with QA datasets to enhance 3D perception.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on LIBERO Franka benchmark and achieves competitive success rates across diverse real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully aligns language, vision, and action representations, enabling direct VLM contribution to action generation, with plans to open-source datasets for community research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates foundation models in fetal ultrasound imaging under low inter-class variability conditions, focusing on distinguishing anatomically similar fetal brain standard planes (TT, TV, TC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how vision foundation models perform when discriminating anatomically similar structures in medical imaging, particularly in fetal ultrasound where subtle differences are clinically critical.

Method: Curated all public fetal ultrasound datasets into FetalUS-188K benchmark, pretrained DINOv3 self-supervised on ultrasound data, and evaluated through linear probing and fine-tuning with different initialization schemes.

Result: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed natural-image initialized models by up to 20% F1-score, with domain-adaptive pretraining preserving subtle structural cues for better discrimination.

Conclusion: Generic foundation models fail under low inter-class variability, while domain-specific pretraining is essential for robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) show competitive performance for flood inundation mapping across different satellite sensors, with Clay model emerging as the best overall performer due to superior accuracy, fine detail retention, few-shot learning capability, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparison between GFMs and traditional models like U-Net for flood mapping across different sensors and data availability scenarios, which is essential to guide end-users in model selection.

Method: Evaluated three GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT) against traditional models (TransNorm, U-Net, Attention U-Net) using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 data. Conducted leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions and few-shot experiments with limited training data.

Result: Clay outperformed others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi led on Sentinel-1 (0.57). Clay showed 4% improvement over U-Net across all 19 sites and achieved 0.64 mIoU with just five training images. Clay is computationally efficient with 26M parameters, making it ~3x faster than Prithvi and 2x faster than DOFA.

Conclusion: GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net, with Clay being the recommended choice due to its balanced performance across accuracy, computational efficiency, and few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for image reconstruction from incomplete measurements that exploits multiple invariances to achieve full supervised performance with less ground truth data, validated on photoacoustic microscopy upsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address image reconstruction from incomplete measurements (upsampling/inpainting) with fixed deterministic sampling patterns that have inherently incomplete coverage, overcoming limitations of conventional supervised and self-supervised methods.

Method: Exploit multiple invariances of the underlying image distribution to theoretically achieve same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches, using less ground truth data.

Result: Validated on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves comparable performance to fully supervised approaches while requiring substantially less ground truth data, making it particularly valuable for applications with limited fully sampled data availability.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for Protected Health Information (PHI) detection in medical imaging, finding LMMs outperform traditional OCR models but OCR improvements don't always translate to better PHI detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PHI detection methods rely on OCR with named entity recognition, but recent LMM advancements offer opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic analysis in medical imaging privacy protection.

Method: Systematically benchmarked three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen 2.5 7B) using two pipeline configurations: text analysis only and OCR+semantic analysis integration, comparing against conventional models like EasyOCR.

Result: LMMs showed superior OCR performance (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) over traditional models, with strongest gains on complex imprint patterns. However, OCR improvements didn't consistently correlate with better PHI detection accuracy.

Conclusion: LMMs offer enhanced OCR capabilities for PHI detection, particularly for complex cases, but careful pipeline selection is needed. The study provides deployment recommendations and strategies for scalable modular infrastructure.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [OLATverse: A Large-scale Real-world Object Dataset with Precise Lighting Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02483)
*Xilong Zhou,Jianchun Chen,Pramod Rao,Timo Teufel,Linjie Lyu,Tigran Minasian,Oleksandr Sotnychenko,Xiaoxiao Long,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OLATverse is a large-scale dataset with 9M images of 765 real-world objects captured under controlled lighting, addressing limitations of synthetic datasets for inverse rendering and relighting tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric inverse rendering and relighting methods rely heavily on synthetic datasets and small-scale real-world datasets, limiting realism and generalization. OLATverse aims to bridge this gap with large-scale real-world coverage and high-fidelity appearance under controlled illumination.

Method: The dataset captures 765 real-world objects using 35 DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, providing well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources.

Result: OLATverse establishes the first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation, offering extensive evaluation capabilities for next-generation methods.

Conclusion: OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating advanced inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data, providing a valuable resource for the research community.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

### [7] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense is an open dataset of IMU signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength activities from 29 subjects using 10 body-worn sensors, with video-validated annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive datasets for tracking strength-demanding activities using wearable IMU sensors, which are crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: Collected data from 29 healthy subjects using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, with video recordings for annotation. Conducted comparative analysis between IMU-estimated joint angles and video-extracted angles for validation.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset with validated sensor data accuracy through joint angle comparison between IMU and video measurements.

Conclusion: StrengthSense provides a valuable resource for researchers and developers to advance human activity recognition algorithms and create fitness/health monitoring applications.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [8] [TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580)
*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAUE is a training-free diffusion model framework that enables zero-shot layer-wise image generation using Noise Transplantation and Cultivation to maintain semantic coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models output single flattened images, creating a bottleneck for professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Current solutions either need large datasets for fine-tuning or can only generate isolated foreground elements without complete scenes.

Method: Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC) extracts intermediate latent representations from foreground and composite generation processes and transplants them into initial noise for subsequent layers to ensure semantic and structural coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show the training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: TAUE eliminates costly training and dataset requirements, enables complex compositional editing, and paves the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

### [9] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an automated pipeline for synthesizing large-scale text-VQA datasets using OCR, ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation models to create faithful QA pairs from scene text in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for text-VQA datasets is tedious and challenging; need for automated end-to-end pipeline leveraging foundation models and mature OCR systems to scale up dataset creation.

Method: Streamlined pipeline combining OCR detection/recognition (text spotting), ROI detection, caption generation, and question generation models to automatically synthesize and validate QA pairs from scene text in images.

Result: Successfully created the first automatically synthesized large-scale text-VQA dataset with approximately 72K QA pairs based on around 44K images.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively automates text-VQA dataset creation, scales with scene text data availability, and produces faithful QA pairs without requiring tedious human annotation.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [10] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A depth-only, markerless AR registration pipeline for HoloLens 2 achieves ~3-4 mm median error in live surgical settings on small/low-curvature anatomies without fiducials, approaching clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and clinically evaluate a markerless AR registration method that works on small or low-curvature anatomies in real surgical settings without requiring fiducial markers, improving the clinical readiness of AR guidance.

Method: On HoloLens 2, align AHAT depth to CT-derived skin meshes via depth-bias correction, human-in-the-loop initialization, and global/local registration. Validated using AR-tracked tools on leg/foot models, then performed 7 intraoperative trials during fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery.

Result: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced and CT distances (leg: median |Δd| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm, 1.20 mm). Clinical median per-point error was 3.9 mm, with anatomy-specific medians of 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg).

Conclusion: The depth-only markerless AR pipeline achieved clinically relevant accuracy (~3-4 mm median error) across feet, ear, and lower leg in live surgery without fiducials. Human-guided initialization plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on challenging anatomies.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [11] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated pipeline combining instance segmentation and chamber ordering algorithms to reconstruct 3D growth trajectories of planktonic foraminifera from CT scans, reducing manual effort while maintaining biological accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tracing of foraminifera chamber growth is largely unexplored, with existing methods relying on time-consuming manual segmentation. Understanding their growth trajectory provides crucial insights into development and ecological adaptation under changing environments.

Method: End-to-end pipeline integrating instance segmentation (computer vision technique) with dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from high-resolution CT scans. Multiple segmentation methods optimized for distinct chamber features were evaluated.

Result: The pipeline substantially reduces manual effort while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Chamber-ordering algorithm remains robust even with partial segmentation, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental trajectories despite some under-segmentation in smaller chambers.

Conclusion: This work provides the first fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [12] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded PCA and Robust PCA framework for accurate pavement crack width measurement from digital images, addressing complex crack morphologies and enabling rapid measurements from arbitrary pixel locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise crack width quantification is crucial for pavement structural assessment but challenging due to complex crack boundaries and the need for rapid measurement capabilities from arbitrary locations.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Initial crack segmentation using detection algorithms, 2) PCA for determining primary orientation axis of quasi-parallel cracks, 3) RPCA for extracting Main Propagation Axis of irregular crack geometries.

Result: Superior performance in computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques across three publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed cascaded PCA-RPCA framework effectively addresses limitations in crack width measurement, providing efficient and accurate quantification for pavement condition evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

TL;DR: Autonomous bias tuning mechanism for event cameras using CNN to detect and mitigate flicker effects across 25-500 Hz range, improving face detection performance in various lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address flicker effects from rapid light variations that degrade event camera performance, without relying on additional hardware or software filters.

Method: Uses CNN to identify flicker in spatial space and dynamically adjust event camera bias settings to minimize flicker impact, tested with face detector framework.

Result: Significant improvements: enhanced YOLO confidence for face detection, increased frames with detected faces, and 38.2-53.6% reduction in flicker indicators (average gradient) across lighting conditions.

Conclusion: The autobiasing system effectively improves event camera functionality in adverse lighting scenarios by leveraging inherent bias settings rather than external filters.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Motivation: The GVQA task requires robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over video content, visual grounding of answers, and temporal tracking of referenced objects.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) Video Reasoning & QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding, and (3) Tracking, with key contribution being a trigger moment derived from CORTEX prompt that identifies the most visible frame of target objects.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over

TL;DR: MM-UNet is a novel deep learning architecture for retinal vessel segmentation that incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to address challenges in segmenting thin, branching vascular structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis of ocular diseases, but existing methods struggle with the unique characteristics of retinal vasculature - extremely thin, branching structures with varying global morphology across images, which challenge segmentation precision and robustness.

Method: Proposed MM-UNet architecture with two key innovations: 1) Morph Mamba Convolution layers that replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception through morph, state-aware feature sampling; 2) Reverse Selective State Guidance modules that integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.

Conclusion: MM-UNet demonstrates effectiveness and advancement in retinal vessel segmentation, providing improved accuracy for clinical diagnosis applications. The project code is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: A language-enhanced generative model synthesizes realistic amyloid-beta PET images from blood biomarkers and MRI, enabling automated Alzheimer's diagnosis with high accuracy comparable to real PET scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis relies on expensive and inaccessible amyloid-beta PET imaging. This study aims to predict Abeta-PET spatial patterns from more accessible blood-based biomarkers and MRI scans to improve diagnostic accessibility.

Method: Collected data from 566 participants including Abeta-PET, T1-weighted MRI, and blood biomarkers. Developed a language-enhanced generative model using large language models and multimodal fusion to synthesize PET images, then evaluated them in an automated diagnostic pipeline.

Result: Synthetic PET images closely matched real PET scans (SSIM = 0.920, Pearson's r = 0.955) with high diagnostic agreement (accuracy = 0.80). Synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78) outperformed T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, with further improvement when combined with BBMs (AUC = 0.79).

Conclusion: The language-enhanced generative model successfully synthesizes realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease assessment and improving diagnostic workflows.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel object-centric 3D reconstruction framework using SAM-2 and alpha channel masking for clean strawberry plant reconstructions, enabling automated plant trait estimation with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive. Current 3DGS applications in agriculture reconstruct entire scenes including background elements, which introduces noise, increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis.

Method: Proposed object-centric 3D reconstruction framework incorporating preprocessing pipeline with Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean strawberry plant reconstructions, followed by automated plant trait estimation using DBSCAN clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Result: The method produces more accurate geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time, outperforming conventional pipelines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry plant phenotyping, enabling automatic estimation of important plant traits such as plant height and canopy width.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

*Anders Austlid Taskén,Thierry Judge,Erik Andreas Rye Berg,Jinyang Yu,Bjørnar Grenne,Frank Lindseth,Svend Aakhus,Pierre-Marc Jodoin,Nicolas Duchateau,Olivier Bernard,Gabriel Kiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces autoStrain, the first automated pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) estimation in transesophageal echocardiography using deep learning methods. It compares two DL approaches - TeeFlow (RAFT optical flow) and TeeTracker (CoTracker point trajectory) - showing TeeTracker achieves better accuracy with 0.65mm mean distance error on synthetic data and clinical validation aligns with references.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques for strain estimation in left ventricular function assessment require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. There is a need for automated solutions to enhance cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Method: Used deep learning methods for motion estimation: TeeFlow based on RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker based on CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions. Employed SIMUS simulation pipeline to generate realistic synthetic TEE dataset with ground truth myocardial motion for training and evaluation.

Result: TeeTracker outperformed TeeFlow with mean distance error of 0.65mm on synthetic test data. Clinical validation on 16 patients showed SLS estimation aligned with clinical references (mean difference 1.09%, 95% limits of agreement -8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia improved model accuracy in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Conclusion: Integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings. The autoStrain pipeline provides an effective automated solution for SLS estimation that aligns well with clinical references.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

TL;DR: Foundation models significantly improve mobile sparse sensing by enhancing geometry-aware image warping and 3D scene reconstruction, overcoming traditional trade-offs between sensing quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing systems face fundamental trade-offs between quality and efficiency due to computational and power constraints. Existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy due to missing spatial and temporal information.

Method: Investigated the use of foundation models for mobile sparse sensing using real-world mobile AR data, focusing on geometry-aware image warping to enable accurate reuse of cross-frame information.

Result: Foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping and demonstrate leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction, showing scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing.

Conclusion: Foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing by addressing traditional trade-offs, though challenges remain in integrating them into mobile systems.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multimodal fusion framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI and PET that addresses modality-specific feature importance and distributional differences through collaborative attention and consistency-guided mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial, and while multimodal neuroimaging fusion shows promise, existing methods overlook modality-specific features and suffer from distributional differences between MRI and PET data that degrade classification performance.

Method: Proposes a Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion framework with learnable parameter representation blocks to handle missing modality information, shared and modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific representations, and consistency-guided mechanisms to align latent distributions across modalities.

Result: Experimental results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate superior diagnostic performance compared to existing fusion strategies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing multimodal fusion approaches by preserving modality-specific features and aligning cross-modal distributions, leading to improved Alzheimer's disease diagnosis accuracy.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

TL;DR: A latent feature alignment method for monocular depth estimation in endoscopic videos that reduces domain gap between synthetic and real images using adversarial learning and directional feature consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised domain adaptation methods for monocular depth estimation in medical endoscopy still leave a domain gap between translated synthetic images and real endoscopic frames, limiting absolute depth estimation accuracy.

Method: Proposes a latent feature alignment approach that takes translated synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input, learning domain-invariant features through adversarial learning and directional feature consistency, agnostic to the image translation process.

Result: Achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with consistent improvements across various backbones and pretrained weights on endoscopic videos of central airway phantoms.

Conclusion: The latent feature alignment method effectively reduces domain gap and improves absolute depth estimation for endoscopic medical robotics applications.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three main challenges in reliable MRG models: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor text-visual entity alignment, and spurious correlations from cross-modal biases, which previous work only addressed individually.

Method: Hierarchical task decomposition approach with HTSC-CIF framework: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features with spatial locations; 2) Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling and Masked Image Modeling for cross-modal alignment; 3) High-level: cross-modal causal intervention via front-door intervention to reduce confounders.

Result: Extensive experiments confirm HTSC-CIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods, demonstrating superior effectiveness in medical report generation.

Conclusion: The proposed HTSC-CIF framework successfully addresses all three key challenges in Medical Report Generation through a comprehensive hierarchical approach, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Euler angles parameterization for probabilistic object pose estimation with Normalizing Flows, arguing that despite Euler angles' limitations, they can produce useful models compared to more complex parameterizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object pose estimation often requires probabilistic outputs due to sensor limitations, projection constraints, and object symmetries that make pose ambiguous. The authors want to investigate whether the simpler Euler angles parameterization can be effective for probabilistic pose estimation models.

Method: The researchers use Euler angles parameterization as the basis for a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. They compare this approach against models built on more complex parameterizations to evaluate its effectiveness.

Result: The paper finds that Euler angles, despite their known shortcomings, can lead to useful probabilistic pose estimation models in various aspects when used with Normalizing Flows.

Conclusion: Euler angles parameterization, while having limitations, can be a viable and effective choice for building probabilistic pose estimation models using Normalizing Flows, offering benefits compared to more complex parameterizations.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

TL;DR: SAIL-RL is a reinforcement learning framework that improves multimodal large language models by teaching them adaptive reasoning strategies - when to think deeply vs answer directly - using dual rewards for reasoning quality and judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs suffer from outcome-only supervision that rewards correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning, and uniform thinking strategies that cause overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones.

Method: Proposes SAIL-RL with dual reward system: Thinking Reward evaluates reasoning quality (factual grounding, logical coherence, answer consistency) and Judging Reward adaptively determines when deep reasoning vs direct answering is appropriate.

Result: Experiments on SAIL-VL2 show improved reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks at 4B and 8B scales, competitive performance against GPT-4o, and substantial reduction in hallucinations.

Conclusion: SAIL-RL establishes a principled framework for building more reliable and adaptive multimodal large language models through adaptive reasoning strategies.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: To improve handwritten mathematical expression recognition by better capturing spatial dependencies between symbols through graph-based modeling.

Method: Use deep BLSTM network for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation classification to form initial graph; apply 2D-CFG parser for spatial relations and GNN-based link prediction to refine structure.

Result: Experimental results show promising performance in HME structure recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The GNN-based approach successfully models HMEs as graphs and effectively recognizes mathematical expression structures through spatial dependency modeling.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten

nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a robust global framework for camera pose estimation that uses modified message-passing least squares with cycle consistency and robust loss functions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without bundle adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust and global camera pose estimation framework that avoids the computational burden of bundle adjustment while maintaining high accuracy and providing strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) for camera location estimation with cycle consistency, redefines cycle consistencies using estimated distances, incorporates Welsch-type robust loss, and adds outlier rejection via robust subspace recovery.

Result: Establishes strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, achieves lowest known sample complexity using only cycle consistency, and consistently outperforms leading pose estimators including full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync provides a robust, global framework for camera pose estimation that eliminates the need for bundle adjustment while achieving superior performance through cycle consistency and robust optimization techniques.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion

*Kun Zou,Yongheng Xu,Jianxing Yu,Yan Pan,Jian Yin,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAFD-CC is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights and fuses decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for robust OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods overlook the inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for effective OOD detection. This limitation motivates the development of a method that can better leverage this relationship.

Method: GAFD-CC performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights to extract positively correlated features (for ID/OOD boundary refinement) and negatively correlated features (to suppress false positives). It then adaptively fuses these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence.

Result: Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong generalization ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC effectively addresses the limitation of existing methods by leveraging the correlation between features and logits, achieving superior OOD detection performance through feature decoupling and confidence calibration.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa introduces continuous cross-modal reasoning for VLMs using latent thought vectors, outperforming larger models on vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are constrained by discrete linguistic tokens, limiting their ability to capture the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual perception and tacit human thought processes.

Method: Uses iterative reasoning with Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) as dynamic reasoning engine, token selection for salient regions, and multi-task training combining contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction.

Result: Improves accuracy and token efficiency over baselines; 1.5B model competes with/surpasses 7B-9B models; 7B version remains competitive with SOTA; latent space shows interpretable reasoning patterns.

Conclusion: CoCoVa successfully bridges the gap between discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding, demonstrating the potential of continuous cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

TL;DR: RxnCaption framework converts chemical reaction diagram parsing into an image captioning task using Large Vision-Language Models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a novel BBox and Index as Visual Prompt strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chemical reaction data often exist as images in papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training machine learning models, which hinders AI research in chemistry.

Method: Proposes RxnCaption framework that reformulates chemical reaction parsing as an image captioning problem, using BBox and Index as Visual Prompt strategy with MolYOLO detector to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices on input images.

Result: RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics, with the BIVP strategy significantly improving structural extraction quality while simplifying model design. Created RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude larger than prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

*Leon Schwarzer,Matthias Zeller,Daniel Casado Herraez,Simon Dierl,Michael Heidingsfeld,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised approach for moving object segmentation in sparse radar point clouds using contrastive learning with cluster refinement, improving label efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors provide direct Doppler velocity measurements for single-scan moving object segmentation, but sparse and noisy radar data makes supervised learning annotation tedious and expensive.

Method: Two-step approach: contrastive self-supervised representation learning with cluster-based loss and dynamic points removal, followed by supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data.

Result: Method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning and boosts state-of-the-art performance through self-supervised pretraining.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining enables effective moving object segmentation in sparse radar data with reduced annotation requirements, enhancing autonomous system reliability.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

### [31] [A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397)
*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A grouping-based hybrid color correction algorithm for color point clouds that adaptively partitions points into proximity groups and applies different correction methods based on overlapping rate estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color consistency correction is fundamental for 3D rendering and compression, but most existing methods focus on color images rather than point clouds.

Method: Estimates overlapping rate between source and target point clouds, partitions points into 2-3 proximity groups (close, moderate, distant), and applies K-nearest neighbors bilateral interpolation (KBI), joint KBI with histogram equalization (JKHE), or histogram equalization (HE) methods respectively.

Result: Tested on 1086 color point cloud pairs and outperformed state-of-the-art methods in achieving color consistency correction.

Conclusion: The proposed grouping-based hybrid approach effectively corrects color consistency in point clouds with demonstrated performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a cross-species visual representation benchmark comparing feline and human visual systems using various neural network architectures, finding that self-supervised ViT models show the strongest alignment with early-stage features bridging species-specific differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feline ocular specializations (vertically elongated pupils for ambush predation) manifest in visual representations compared to humans, and to develop a unified benchmark for quantifying cross-species representational alignment.

Method: Used a frozen-encoder benchmark with convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), employing layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis with additional distributional and stability tests.

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieved the highest alignment (mean CKA-RBF ≈0.814, mean CKA-linear ≈0.745, mean RSA ≈0.698), peaking at early blocks. Supervised ViTs were competitive on CKA but showed weaker geometric correspondence than DINO. CNNs were strong baselines but below plain ViTs, and windowed transformers underperformed plain ViTs.

Conclusion: Self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing neuroscientific hypotheses about cross-species visual computation convergence.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

TL;DR: IllumFlow is a novel framework that combines conditional Rectified Flow with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement, addressing illumination variations and noise through separate optimization of illumination and reflectance components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To effectively handle both lighting variations and noise in low-light images, which requires separate treatment of illumination and reflectance components for optimal enhancement.

Method: Decomposes input images into reflectance and illumination components using Retinex theory, applies conditional rectified flow for illumination modeling, and uses a denoising network with flow-derived data augmentation for reflectance noise removal.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over existing methods in low-light enhancement and exposure correction tasks.

Conclusion: IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation across lighting conditions while supporting customizable brightness enhancement, effectively handling both illumination variations and noise in low-light images.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses limitations in complex chart understanding by generating high-quality datasets that significantly enhance reasoning capabilities and enable practical performance assessment, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve competitive performance in complex chart comprehension tasks.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these

thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets have significant potential and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model training in agricultural robotics applications.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for

demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAFormer is a novel multi-view action recognition method for spatio-temporal action recognition (STAR) that uses transformer-based cooperation between views while preserving spatial information in feature maps, achieving 4.4 F-measure improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous multi-view action recognition methods focus on single action recognition from entire videos and cannot handle the STAR setting where each person's action is recognized sequentially. They also lose spatial information by using embedding vectors.

Method: Proposes MVAFormer with a transformer-based cooperation module that uses feature maps instead of embedding vectors to preserve spatial information. The module divides self-attention for same and different views to effectively model relationships between multiple views.

Result: Experiments on a newly collected dataset show MVAFormer outperforms comparison baselines by approximately 4.4 points on F-measure.

Conclusion: MVAFormer effectively addresses multi-view action recognition in the STAR setting through spatial-preserving feature map cooperation and divided self-attention, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Motivation: Current change detection models are limited by single-type annotated data and cannot leverage diverse BCD and SCD datasets simultaneously, leading to poor generalization and limited versatility.

Result: Achieved SOTA performance on four benchmarks: WHU-CD (90.41 IoU), S2Looking (53.04 IoU), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87 IoU), and SECOND (57.62 IoU), surpassing all previous methods.

Conclusion: UniChange successfully unifies BCD and SCD tasks, effectively acquires knowledge from multi-source datasets even with conflicting class definitions, and demonstrates superior performance through MLLM integration.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

### [41] [Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489)
*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-view UAV localization framework using object detection and graph neural networks for accurate map matching in GNSS-denied environments, achieving strong performance on heterogeneous aerial image matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address UAV localization challenges in GNSS-denied areas where satellite-based methods fail, particularly handling cross-temporal, cross-view, and heterogeneous aerial image matching problems.

Method: Leverages modern object detection to extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, integrates graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships, and uses fine-grained graph-based node-similarity metric for retrieval and localization.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show the method effectively handles heterogeneous appearance differences, generalizes well, and performs strongly in retrieval and localization, even applicable to larger modality gaps like infrared-visible image matching.

Conclusion: The proposed object detection and graph neural network approach provides an effective solution for cross-view UAV localization, overcoming limitations of existing methods and demonstrating strong performance across various challenging scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

### [42] [VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778)
*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCode introduces SVG code as a visual representation benchmark for multimodal understanding, proposing CodeVQA evaluation and VCoder framework to improve visual-centric coding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current progress in coding focuses on language-centric tasks while visual-centric coding remains underexplored. The paper advocates for SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation inspired by human sketch reasoning.

Method: The paper introduces VCode benchmark covering three domains (commonsense, professional disciplines, visual perception) and CodeVQA evaluation protocol. It also presents VCoder framework with Thinking with Revision (iterative SVG refinement) and Acting with Visual Tools (using detectors/parsers for structured cues).

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle with faithful SVG generation, showing gaps in visual-centric coding. VCoder achieves 12.3-point overall gain over Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs but maintain consistency.

Conclusion: SVG code shows promise as symbolic visual representation. The gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding persists, but VCoder's agentic framework effectively bridges this gap through iterative refinement and visual tool integration.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

### [43] [Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503)
*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtychoBench introduces a multi-modal benchmark for ptychographic analysis, comparing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) strategies. Results show task-dependent optimal approaches: SFT+ICL works best for visual artifact detection, while ICL alone excels for textual parameter recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal domain adaptation strategy for foundation models (LLMs/VLMs) in specialized scientific microscopy workflows, addressing the unclear adaptation methods for scientific tasks.

Method: Created PtychoBench benchmark to systematically compare SFT and ICL strategies on visual artifact detection (VLMs) and textual parameter recommendation (LLMs) tasks in data-scarce conditions, using context-aware prompting and comparing against GPT-4o and DINOv3 baselines.

Result: For visual tasks: SFT+ICL achieved highest performance (Micro-F1 0.728). For textual tasks: ICL on large base model was superior (Micro-F1 0.847), outperforming SFT models. Identified consistent contextual interference in fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Optimal specialization path depends on task modality, providing a framework for developing effective science-based AI systems. SFT and ICL are complementary for visual tasks, while ICL alone excels for textual tasks.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

TL;DR: Proposes a pipeline for generating automated natural language reports for mobile robotics using local multi-modal sensors and edge computing, eliminating need for external services while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for evaluating large amounts of heterogeneous data from AI-enabled robotics in critical applications like autonomous driving and service robotics, requiring automated report generation to facilitate system evaluation and acceptance.

Method: Developed a pipeline utilizing various multi-modal sensors that relies solely on local models deployable on edge computing devices, preserving privacy and eliminating external service dependencies.

Result: Evaluated implementation on diverse dataset spanning indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluation results with example reports available via public repository.

Conclusion: The proposed automated report generation pipeline enables privacy-preserving evaluation of mobile robotics systems using local edge computing, facilitating acceptance of AI-enabled robotics in critical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

### [45] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning training pipeline for sparse-voxel rasterization that improves stability and reduces memory usage while maintaining quality. It addresses underfitting of low-frequency content, brittle pruning heuristics, and VRAM overgrowth through inverse-Sobel reweighting, depth-quantile pruning, and explicit growth budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization suffers from underfitting low-frequency content, dependence on brittle pruning heuristics, and VRAM overgrowth that inflates memory usage. These limitations make training unpredictable and memory-intensive.

Method: Uses inverse-Sobel reweighting with mid-training gamma-ramp for low-frequency awareness, depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis guards for stable adaptation, and ray-footprint-based priority-driven subdivision under explicit growth budget.

Result: Reduces peak VRAM by 40%-60% while maintaining comparable PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS. Mitigates errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability, preserving detail that prior methods miss.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel enables more predictable, memory-efficient training without sacrificing perceptual quality, making sparse-voxel rasterization steadier and lighter.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

### [46] [Unsupervised Learning for Industrial Defect Detection: A Case Study on Shearographic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02541)
*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates three unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in shearographic images, with the student-teacher model showing superior performance in classification robustness and defect localization compared to autoencoder-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shearography is a sensitive non-destructive testing method but requires expert interpretation, limiting industrial adoption. This research aims to reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation through unsupervised learning for automated anomaly detection.

Method: Three unsupervised architectures were evaluated: fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, and student-teacher feature matching model. All models were trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled dataset with reproducible defect patterns was developed, including both undistorted and globally deformed defect-free samples to simulate practical inspection conditions.

Result: The student-teacher approach achieved superior classification robustness and enabled precise defect localization. It demonstrated improved separability of feature representations compared to autoencoder-based models, as shown through t-SNE embeddings. A YOLOv8 model trained on labeled data served as a localization quality benchmark.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial environments, with the student-teacher model showing particular promise for robust anomaly detection and localization.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models can predict future brain MRI scans from baseline images with high fidelity, enabling personalized prognosis for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict future brain states from baseline MRI scans, which is crucial for studying neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, by forecasting entire brain MRI images years into the future rather than just cognitive scores or clinical outcomes.

Method: Implemented and evaluated five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL) for MRI image-to-image prediction, comparing predicted follow-up MRIs with actual scans using global similarity and local difference metrics.

Result: The best performing models achieved high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalized well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: UVH-26 is the first large-scale Indian traffic dataset with 26,646 images from Bengaluru CCTV cameras, featuring 1.8M bounding boxes across 14 vehicle classes. Models trained on this dataset show 8.4-31.5% improvement over COCO-trained baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical gap in existing global benchmarks for Indian traffic scenarios and provide domain-specific training data for intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic conditions.

Method: Collected 26,646 high-resolution images from 2800 Bengaluru CCTV cameras over 4 weeks, annotated through crowdsourced hackathon with 565 students. Used Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms to derive consensus ground truth. Trained multiple detectors including YOLO11, RT-DETR, and DAMO-YOLO variants.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 achieved 8.4-31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained baselines. RT-DETR-X showed best performance at 0.67 mAP50:95 compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights on common classes (Car, Bus, Truck).

Conclusion: UVH-26 demonstrates significant benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic scenarios and provides a foundation for advancing detection and classification systems in complex traffic conditions of emerging nations.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTF-CVReID is a parameter-efficient framework for video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains, introducing seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone to address extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining real-time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based person re-identification in cross-view domains (like aerial-ground surveillance) faces challenges from extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes MTF-CVReID framework with seven modules: Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN), Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH), Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM), Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM), Inter-View Feature Alignment (IVFA), Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL), and Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) built over ViT-B/16 backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS datasets. Adds only ~2M parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over baseline while maintaining 189 FPS real-time efficiency.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without compromising computational efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-efficient approaches for cross-view video ReID.

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCFlow is a subject-agnostic brain decoding framework that reconstructs visual experiences from fMRI by modeling the ventral-dorsal visual system architecture, achieving fast reconstruction without subject-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable clinical applications by overcoming challenges in cross-subject generalization and complex brain signal processing for visual reconstruction from fMRI.

Method: Hierarchical framework modeling ventral-dorsal visual system with feature-level contrastive learning to extract subject-invariant semantic representations.

Result: Sacrifices only 7% accuracy while generating reconstructed videos in 10 seconds without retraining, compared to conventional methods requiring 12+ hours per subject.

Conclusion: VCFlow provides a fast, clinically scalable solution for subject-agnostic brain decoding without extensive per-subject data or computation.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-animal tracking is challenging due to habitat variations, motion patterns, and species appearance differences, requiring extensive fine-tuning in traditional approaches.

Method: Combines Grounding Dino object detector with Segment Anything Model 2 tracker and carefully designed heuristics for zero-shot tracking without retraining.

Result: Strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments on ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and GMOT-40 datasets.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models enable effective zero-shot multi-animal tracking across diverse scenarios without model retraining or hyperparameter adaptation.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Result: The proposed architecture provides seamless liveness detection with faster biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). A demonstration video validates the effectiveness of the approach in detecting various attack types.

Conclusion: The lightweight CNN framework successfully addresses the vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks by providing efficient and fast liveness detection capabilities for enhanced security in biometric authentication systems.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPruneBench is a unified benchmark for evaluating visual token pruning methods in large multimodal models, covering 6 ability dimensions, 10 datasets, 10 compression algorithms, and 3 LMM families with standardized protocols and system-level metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from severe inference inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens from image encoders, and existing token compression methods lack consistent and comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: Developed UniPruneBench with standardized protocols across multiple dimensions, evaluating 10 compression algorithms on 3 LMM families (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, Qwen2.5-VL) using 6 ability dimensions and 10 datasets, incorporating both task accuracy and system-level metrics.

Result: Key findings: random pruning is surprisingly strong baseline; no single method consistently outperforms others; OCR tasks are most vulnerable to pruning; pruning ratio is the dominant factor affecting performance degradation.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable foundation for future research on efficient multimodal modeling by offering standardized evaluation of visual token pruning methods.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLEXICORP is a pipeline that combines concept relevance propagation with multimodal LLMs to automatically name concepts and generate natural language explanations for CNN decisions, making XAI more accessible and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CRP workflows are manual and require experts to inspect activations and synthesize explanations, limiting accessibility and scalability of explanations for CNN decisions.

Method: Couples CRP with a multimodal LLM to automatically assign descriptive names to concept prototypes and generate natural-language explanations from relevance distributions using carefully crafted prompts.

Result: Successfully generates tailored explanations for different audiences on ImageNet images using VGG16 model, providing both technical details for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical users.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-based attribution methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to interpreting deep neural networks and enable more transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MTRL, a parameter-free VI-ReID framework that uses modality-transition representations with generated intermediate images to better align cross-modal features between visible and infrared modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID methods have limitations: they create intermediate representations through data enhancement or feature fusion, which don't fully utilize intermediate features and often require additional parameters while lacking interpretability.

Method: Proposes Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with middle generated images as transmitters between visible and infrared modalities, using modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss for training without additional parameters.

Result: The framework achieves same inference speed as backbone while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: MTRL effectively aligns cross-modal features without extra parameters, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in visible-infrared person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework for video emotion analysis that uses video emotion foundation models (VidEmo) with two-stage tuning and a 2.1M instruction-based dataset (Emo-CFG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are dynamic and cues-dependent, making it challenging to understand complex emotional states with reasonable rationale in video analysis.

Method: Stage-wise framework unifying attribute perception, expression analysis, and emotional understanding using VidEmo models with curriculum emotion learning and affective-tree reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance and sets new milestones across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses challenges in video emotion analysis through specialized foundation models and comprehensive data infrastructure.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, examining how modern video and language encoders align across modalities and proposing test-time scaling laws to predict alignment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While image-text alignment has been well studied, the temporal nature of video data remains largely unexplored in cross-modal representation alignment research.

Method: The authors conduct systematic experiments on video-text alignment, analyzing how visual richness (static images vs. multi-frame videos) and text richness (single caption vs. collection) affect alignment. They propose parametric test-time scaling laws and investigate correlations between semantic alignment and downstream task performance.

Result: Findings show cross-modal alignment highly depends on data richness at test time, with proposed scaling laws demonstrating strong predictive power. Strong alignment correlates with general-purpose video representation and understanding, and temporal reasoning is linked to cross-modal alignment.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment serves as an informative zero-shot method to probe representation power of encoders for spatio-temporal data, providing insights into structural similarities and downstream capabilities across modalities.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PercHead is a unified method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic 3D editing using perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1, achieving state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis with exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in single-image 3D head reconstruction including severe view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity of 3D editing by developing a unified approach with strong perceptual guidance.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoder with ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features to 3D via iterative cross-attention, rendered with Gaussian Splatting. Employs perceptual supervision from DINOv2 and SAM2.1. For editing, swaps encoder and disentangles geometry (via segmentation maps) from style (via text/image prompts).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis with exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles. Enables intuitive semantic 3D editing through interactive GUI.

Conclusion: PercHead provides a unified framework for high-quality 3D head reconstruction and intuitive semantic editing, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [60] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a new benchmark for evaluating models that require generating intermediate visual images (like sketches or diagrams) for complex reasoning tasks, addressing limitations of text-only Chain-of-Thought methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CoT methods rely solely on text, but many complex problems require visual reasoning similar to how humans "draw to think". MIRA addresses this gap by focusing on tasks with complex structures and spatial relationships that are difficult to express through language alone.

Method: The benchmark includes 546 multimodal problems annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. It uses a unified evaluation protocol with three input levels: direct input (image+question), text-only CoT (image+thinking prompts), and Visual-CoT (annotated image clues+textual thinking prompts). Performance is measured using pass@k and majority voting accuracies.

Result: Existing multimodal LLMs perform poorly with text-only prompts but show consistent improvement (average 33.7% relative gain) when intermediate visual cues are provided. Expanding search space and designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT yielded only limited improvements compared to Visual-CoT.

Conclusion: Intermediate visual information is critical for successful reasoning on complex multimodal tasks, highlighting the limitations of text-only reasoning approaches and the importance of visual imagination in problem-solving.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

*Nusrat Tasnim,Kutub Uddin,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate AI-generated media forensic methods, addressing gaps in standardized benchmarks, training protocols, and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated media (deepfakes) poses significant threats to multimedia forensics, misinformation detection, and biometric systems, leading to erosion of public trust, increased fraud, and social engineering attacks. Existing forensic methods suffer from non-standardized benchmarks, inconsistent training protocols, and limited evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors developed a unified benchmarking framework and evaluated ten state-of-the-art forensic methods (scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned) across seven publicly available datasets (GAN and diffusion-generated images) using multiple metrics including accuracy, average precision, ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. They also analyzed model interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps.

Result: The evaluations revealed substantial variability in generalization across methods, with some showing strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model transferability. The systematic analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of current forensic approaches.

Conclusion: This study provides guidance for the research community to better understand current forensic methods and inspires development of more robust, generalizable, and explainable solutions for detecting AI-generated media.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks is a learned representation for human heads that enables high-quality dense correspondences by predicting 3D embeddings for each pixel in a canonical unit cube, trained using contrastive learning with point matches from talking heads videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust dense correspondences for human head images that are interpretable, queryable, and work across diverse poses and individuals while covering the entire head including hair.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer to predict 3D pixel embeddings in canonical space, trained with contrastive loss on pairwise point matches from talking heads videos, plus multi-task learning with face landmarks, segmentation constraints, and spatial continuity through latent cube features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, robust to pose variations and covering entire head including hair.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides an effective learned representation for human heads that enables various applications like semantic part finding, tracking, and stereo reconstruction while maintaining consistency across poses and individuals.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

TL;DR: GEMS (Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation) demonstrates that graph neural networks can match or surpass LLMs in discrete choice simulation tasks while being three orders of magnitude smaller and more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether smaller, domain-grounded models can effectively replace large language models for human simulation tasks, particularly in discrete choice problems.

Method: Casts discrete choice simulation as a link prediction problem on graphs using GNNs, leveraging relational knowledge and incorporating language representations only when necessary.

Result: GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs across three simulation datasets and settings, with significantly greater efficiency, interpretability, and transparency.

Conclusion: Graph-based modeling offers a promising lightweight alternative to LLMs for human simulation, providing comparable performance with far fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate humans, with
applications ranging from survey prediction to decision-making. However, are
LLMs strictly necessary, or can smaller, domain-grounded models suffice? We
identify a large class of simulation problems in which individuals make choices
among discrete options, where a graph neural network (GNN) can match or surpass
strong LLM baselines despite being three orders of magnitude smaller. We
introduce Graph-basEd Models for human Simulation (GEMS), which casts discrete
choice simulation tasks as a link prediction problem on graphs, leveraging
relational knowledge while incorporating language representations only when
needed. Evaluations across three key settings on three simulation datasets show
that GEMS achieves comparable or better accuracy than LLMs, with far greater

Motivation: With growing computational demands of LLMs, efficient inference is critical for practical deployment. Existing depth pruning methods use fixed block masks, leading to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Discover diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and L0 optimization, (2) Implement efficient dynamic pruning at inference time without extensive training.

Result: Experimental results show the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods.

Conclusion: IG-Pruning is particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios due to its input-aware dynamic pruning capability.

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

*Jonathan Liu,Haoling Qiu,Jonathan Lasko,Damianos Karakos,Mahsa Yarmohammadi,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops an infrastructure to automatically generate and evaluate medical chatbot queries, revealing low inter-LLM agreement in evaluations and recommending multiple LLM evaluators for reliable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when medical chatbots fail due to non-medical factors like demographics, given the prevalence of hallucinations, omissions, and biases in LLMs used in medical contexts.

Method: Created an infrastructure with: 1) automated query generation pipeline sampling patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles; 2) evaluation pipeline using LLM-as-a-judge setups for hallucination/omission detection and treatment category classification.

Result: Found low inter-LLM agreement (average Cohen's Kappa κ=0.118), with only specific LLM pairs showing statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and races.

Conclusion: Recommends using multiple LLM evaluators to avoid non-generalizable results and suggests publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency, especially when ground-truth data is unavailable.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench is a new visual evaluation benchmark that transforms LLM assessment from numerical scores to observable drawings, revealing critical spatial reasoning limitations that traditional benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation relies on opaque numerical metrics that conceal fundamental spatial reasoning limitations and create a dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities for real-world applications.

Method: LTD-Bench uses drawing generation through dot matrices or executable code to test spatial reasoning, with complementary generation tasks (spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (spatial perception) across three difficulty levels, evaluating bidirectional language-spatial mapping.

Result: Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal an alarming capability gap - even high-performing LLMs on traditional benchmarks show profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional mappings between language and spatial concepts.

Conclusion: LTD-Bench exposes fundamental limitations in LLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities that undermine their potential as genuine world models, while providing visual diagnostics for model analysis and similarity investigation.

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

### [68] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon is a universal multimodal embedder that adaptively determines when to augment queries, improving performance while reducing embedding latency by only augmenting queries that need it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based embedders augment every query, leading to substantial embedding latency and potential performance degradation for some queries. Previous methods haven't been explored in multimodal environments.

Method: Divides training queries into two groups (needing augmentation vs not), generates appropriate augmentations using MLLM, and implements adaptive query augmentation where M-Solomon learns to generate /augment prefix for queries needing augmentation and /embed for others.

Result: M-Solomon surpassed baseline without augmentation by a large margin and outperformed baseline that always used augmentation, while providing much faster embedding latency.

Conclusion: Adaptive query augmentation with M-Solomon effectively balances performance and efficiency by selectively augmenting only necessary queries in multimodal environments.

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B is a specialized bilingual language model for Ayurveda medicine that outperforms larger models in its domain by using expert-curated datasets and rigorous annotation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream LLMs underperform in specialized domains like Ayurveda that require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise, creating a need for domain-specialized models.

Method: Fine-tuned Param-1-2.9B using an extensive, expertly curated Ayurveda dataset with context-aware reasoning and objective-style Q&A in English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation protocols.

Result: AyurParam surpasses all open-source instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5-3B parameters) and shows competitive or superior performance compared to much larger models on BhashaBench-Ayur.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation with high-quality supervision is essential for delivering reliable, culturally congruent AI in specialized medical knowledge domains like Ayurveda.

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAdv is a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, achieving up to 95% success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns, demonstrating that current safety mechanisms are vulnerable to adaptive multi-turn conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM jailbreaking evaluations focus on single-turn interactions, but real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations, revealing gaps in current safety mechanisms optimized for single-turn scenarios.

Method: AutoAdv combines three adaptive mechanisms: pattern manager that learns from successful attacks, temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters, and two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them.

Result: Achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns (24% improvement over single-turn baselines), with consistent vulnerabilities found across commercial and open-source models including GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, and Mistral-7B.

Conclusion: Current alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses against adaptive jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

*Kentaro Ueda,François Portet,Hirohiko Suwa,Keiichi Yasumoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training (CPT) experts to create financial LLMs, evaluating three merging methods on a comprehensive financial benchmark and finding that merging recovers lost general knowledge while enabling emergent cross-domain skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in specialized domains like finance that require diverse skills (domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning, multilingual processing). Merging CPT experts offers a practical alternative to costly multi-skill training, but CPT model merging remains largely unexplored compared to SFT model merging.

Method: Created financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and Japanese. Proposed three-stage evaluation (knowledge recovery, complementarity, emergence) and assessed three merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets.

Result: Merging an expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while merging experts improves performance and yields emergent cross-domain skills. Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is hyperparameter-sensitive, while TIES is more robust. Model similarity correlates with merging success, but emergent skills depend on more complex factors.

Conclusion: This work presents the first foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing assets.

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing

*Giulia Iadisernia,Carolina Camassa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona-based prompting doesn't improve LLM macroeconomic forecasting accuracy. GPT-4o achieves similar performance to human experts but persona descriptions provide no measurable advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks compared to human experts.

Method: Used 2,368 economics-related personas from PersonaHub corpus to prompt GPT-4o, replicating ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). Compared against human experts panel and 100 baseline forecasts without personas.

Result: GPT-4o and human forecasters achieved remarkably similar accuracy levels with statistically significant but practically modest differences. No measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions was found.

Conclusion: GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy on out-of-sample macroeconomic events when provided with relevant context data, but persona descriptions can be omitted without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual resume screening is time-consuming, error-prone, and subject to human bias, creating a need for automated hiring solutions.

Method: Combines document parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding to encode resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space for similarity scoring. The system is modular and explainable.

Result: Achieves competitive matching accuracy on real-world datasets across multiple professional domains while maintaining high interpretability and transparency.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable and practical NLP framework for recruitment analytics with potential for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and large-scale deployment of data-driven hiring solutions.

Abstract: Hiring processes often involve the manual screening of hundreds of resumes
for each job, a task that is time and effort consuming, error-prone, and
subject to human bias. This paper presents Smart-Hiring, an end-to-end Natural
Language Processing (NLP) pipeline de- signed to automatically extract
structured information from unstructured resumes and to semantically match
candidates with job descriptions. The proposed system combines document
parsing, named-entity recognition, and contextual text embedding techniques to
capture skills, experience, and qualifications. Using advanced NLP technics,
Smart-Hiring encodes both resumes and job descriptions in a shared vector space
to compute similarity scores between candidates and job postings. The pipeline
is modular and explainable, allowing users to inspect extracted entities and
matching rationales. Experiments were conducted on a real-world dataset of
resumes and job descriptions spanning multiple professional domains,
demonstrating the robustness and feasibility of the proposed approach. The
system achieves competitive matching accuracy while preserving a high degree of
interpretability and transparency in its decision process. This work introduces
a scalable and practical NLP frame- work for recruitment analytics and outlines
promising directions for bias mitigation, fairness-aware modeling, and

Motivation: To improve Google Translate's accuracy and fluency by identifying and analyzing lexical errors in translations of important medical and health information related to COVID-19.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of 230 English-to-Romanian translated texts from official sources (WHO, Gavi, patient information leaflets) using Google Translate, focusing specifically on lexical error identification.

Result: Identification of various lexical errors in machine translations of COVID-19 related medical documents, providing specific insights into where Google Translate struggles with accurate lexical selection.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable data for enhancing Google Translate's lexical accuracy in medical translations, particularly for Romanian language, which can contribute to overall improvement of machine translation quality for specialized domains.

Abstract: The research explores error analysis in the performance of translating by

TL;DR: NTKT reframes Knowledge Tracing as a next-token prediction task using LLMs, incorporating question text to improve performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT models overlook question text, missing pedagogical insights and limiting predictive performance, creating an opportunity to leverage LLMs for better student modeling.

Method: NTKT represents student histories and question content as text sequences, using pretrained LLMs for next-token prediction to learn patterns in both behavior and language.

Result: Significantly improves performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalizes better to cold-start questions and users.

Conclusion: Question content is crucial for KT, and leveraging pretrained LLM representations effectively models student learning.

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGES is a Bayesian framework that uses confidence signals to adaptively stop sampling when a candidate answer's posterior probability exceeds a threshold, reducing model calls by ~69% while maintaining accuracy comparable to self-consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency requires fixed multiple queries and fails when correct answers are rare, needing a more efficient approach that dynamically determines when to stop sampling.

Method: Bayesian framework using confidence signals from token probabilities or reward models to form posteriors over candidate answers, stopping sampling adaptively when posterior mass exceeds threshold.

Result: Reduces average model calls by ~69% (e.g., from 16.0 to 4.9) while matching self-consistency accuracy within 0.06 percentage points across five reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: CGES provides an efficient alternative to self-consistency with theoretical guarantees and significant computational savings while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Vivek Srivastava,Shirish Karande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE is a framework for dynamic LLM alignment that enables precise policy updates through programmatic triage and hybrid optimization, addressing the Alignment-Reality Gap without degrading model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods produce static models that fail to adapt to evolving human values and policies, creating an Alignment-Reality Gap. Existing solutions are either too expensive (large-scale re-annotation) or too destructive (standard unlearning methods that erode utility).

Method: TRACE programmatically triages existing preference data against new policies, identifies high-impact conflicts using an alignment impact score, and applies hybrid optimization that selectively inverts, discards, or preserves preferences while protecting model performance.

Result: TRACE achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B) on both synthetic benchmarks and PKU-SafeRLHF dataset under complex policy shifts, enforcing new principles without degrading general capabilities.

Conclusion: TRACE establishes a scalable, dynamic, and cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation for sustainable and responsible AI deployment by enabling precise policy updates without model degradation.

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

*Renfei Dang,Peng Hu,Changjiang Gao,Shujian Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how fine-tuning LLMs with new knowledge causes factual hallucinations, finding that high unfamiliarity of specific knowledge types drives hallucinations more than overall new knowledge proportion. The authors propose KnownPatch to mitigate this by adding known knowledge samples during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed that introducing new knowledge during LLM fine-tuning causes factual hallucinations on known information, but lacked deep investigation into specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms.

Method: Created controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, conducted fine-grained analysis across knowledge types and tasks (QA and reasoning), proposed KnownPatch method that patches known knowledge samples in later training stages, and performed attention analysis.

Result: Fine-tuning with entirely new knowledge types significantly increases hallucination tendencies, which can affect other knowledge types in QA tasks. KnownPatch effectively alleviates new-knowledge-induced hallucinations and improves performance by restoring attention to key entities.

Conclusion: High unfamiliarity of specific knowledge types is a stronger driver of hallucinations than overall new knowledge proportion. Learning new knowledge reduces attention to key entities, causing excessive focus on context and increasing hallucination risk. KnownPatch mitigates these issues by preserving attention patterns on key entities.

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

### [80] [Optimal Singular Damage: Efficient LLM Inference in Low Storage Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02681)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes 'optimal singular damage' method for efficient storage of fine-tuned LLMs by combining low-rank approximation with selective sparsification to retain critical singular components while achieving storage efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are too large for most applications to store multiple fine-tuned versions, and existing methods like low-rank approximation or sparsification alone may discard important parameters that enhance model expressivity.

Method: The method leverages that fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse. It uses sparsified low-rank approximations with larger ranks and selectively sparsifies updates based on the interleaved importance of singular vectors to retain the most impactful components.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed method achieves significant storage efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to using low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Conclusion: Combining low-rank approximation with selective sparsification through optimal singular damage provides an effective solution for efficient storage of fine-tuned LLMs while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PragExTra is the first multilingual corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation in translation, covering 8 language pairs and using active learning to identify cultural adaptations like entity descriptions and measurement conversions with up to 88% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pragmatic explicitation - where translators add background details to make implicit cultural meanings explicit - has been widely discussed in translation theory but rarely modeled computationally, creating a gap in understanding this cross-linguistic phenomenon.

Method: Built PragExTra corpus from TED-Multi and Europarl covering 8 language pairs; identified candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined using active learning with human annotation; developed detection framework for entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks.

Result: Entity and system-level explicitations were most frequent; active learning improved classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88 accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages; established pragmatic explicitation as measurable phenomenon.

Conclusion: PragExTra establishes pragmatic explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and represents a step towards building culturally aware machine translation systems that can handle cultural adaptations.

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,

*Amit Misra,Syed Waqas Zamir,Wassim Hamidouche,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Juan Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI adoption is lower in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs) due to poor performance of Large Language Models on low-resource languages, creating a 20% adoption gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why AI adoption remains uneven globally, specifically testing the hypothesis that poor LLM performance on low-resource languages reduces AI utility and slows adoption in LRLCs.

Method: Used weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and demographic factors.

Result: LRLCs have approximately 20% lower share of AI users relative to their baseline after controlling for other factors.

Conclusion: Linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI diffusion globally.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

TL;DR: CoRL introduces a centralized multi-LLM framework with a controller that selectively coordinates expert models using reinforcement learning to optimize performance-cost trade-off across different budget conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decentralized multi-LLM systems invoke multiple models for every input, leading to uncontrolled high inference costs, while different LLMs have complementary strengths across domains with varying costs.

Method: A centralized framework with a controller LLM that selectively coordinates expert models using reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing inference cost, adaptable to different budget conditions.

Result: Experiments on four benchmarks show CoRL surpasses the best expert LLM under high-budget settings while maintaining strong performance in low-budget modes, demonstrating effective centralized coordination.

Conclusion: Centralized coordination enables scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems that can adapt to different budget constraints while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

*Hung-Ting Chen,Xiang Liu,Shauli Ravfogel,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMER is a new retriever architecture that generates multiple query vectors autoregressively to capture multimodal document distributions, achieving 4x better performance on synthetic data and 4-21% gains on real-world datasets compared to single-embedding models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text retrievers use only one query vector, which struggles to capture multimodal distributions of relevant documents when there are multiple interpretations of a query.

Method: Developed AMER (Autoregressive Multi-Embedding Retriever) that autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, all of which are used to retrieve documents from the corpus.

Result: On synthetic data, AMER captured multiple target distributions perfectly with 4x better performance than single embedding models. On real-world multi-answer retrieval datasets, it showed 4% and 21% relative gains over single-embedding baselines, with larger gains when target document embeddings are less similar.

Conclusion: The multi-query vector approach demonstrates significant potential for improving retrieval performance, especially for queries with multimodal relevant document distributions, opening a new direction for future work.

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

*Qianhao Yuan,Jie Lou,Zichao Li,Jiawei Chen,Yaojie Lu,Hongyu Lin,Le Sun,Debing Zhang,Xianpei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemSearcher is an agent workflow that maintains compact memory across multi-turn interactions, stabilizing context length and improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. It uses multi-context GRPO RL framework to jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between preserving complete interaction history (which creates long, noisy contexts with high computation costs) versus using only current turn (which discards essential information), limiting search agent scalability.

Method: Iterative memory maintenance workflow that fuses user questions with compact memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only essential information. Uses multi-context GRPO RL framework that samples trajectory groups under different contexts and propagates advantages across conversations.

Result: Significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. 3B-based MemSearcher outperforms 7B-based baselines, achieving higher accuracy with lower computational overhead.

Conclusion: Striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead. The approach stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, making search agents more scalable.

Abstract: Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM
context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts,
resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the
current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This
trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge,
we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact
memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses
the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform
search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for
solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn
interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize
this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that
jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of
MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of
trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level
advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as
Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines
on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher
even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance
between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and
lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at

### [86] [Oolong: Evaluating Long Context Reasoning and Aggregation Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02817)
*Amanda Bertsch,Adithya Pratapa,Teruko Mitamura,Graham Neubig,Matthew R. Gormley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Oolong is a benchmark for evaluating long-context reasoning that requires analyzing individual text chunks and aggregating analyses to answer distributional questions, unlike existing benchmarks that mainly test retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing long-context evaluations primarily test retrieval from context sections, allowing models to disregard most context tokens as noise. This represents only one type of long-context task, leaving a gap for reasoning tasks that require comprehensive context analysis.

Method: Oolong consists of two task sets: Oolong-synth (naturalistic synthetic tasks for easy ablation studies) and Oolong-real (real-world conversational data reasoning). It requires models to reason over large text quantities, perform classification and counting in-context, and handle temporal and user relations.

Result: Even frontier models struggle significantly on Oolong, with GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy on both splits at 128K context length.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals limitations in current models' long-context reasoning capabilities and provides data and evaluation tools to advance development of models that can effectively reason over large text quantities.

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This research explores whether artificial neural networks can develop mirror neuron patterns similar to biological systems, and how these patterns might enable intrinsic AI alignment through empathy-like mechanisms that support cooperative behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI alignment strategies rely on external constraints that may be insufficient for super-intelligent AI. The study investigates whether intrinsic alignment through mirror neuron patterns could complement existing techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly in AI architectures.

Method: Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, the researchers identified conditions for mirror-neuron emergence, evaluated their influence on action circuits, introduced the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation, and proposed a theoretical framework.

Result: The study found that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior.

Conclusion: Mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing AI alignment techniques by embedding intrinsic empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures, potentially providing more robust alignment against future super-intelligent systems.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

TL;DR: Introduces human-AI co-embodied intelligence that combines human expertise, agentic AI, and wearable hardware for real-world scientific experiments and manufacturing, demonstrated through the APEX system in cleanroom electronics fabrication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between machine intelligence and physical execution in scientific experiments and manufacturing to improve reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility.

Method: Human-AI co-embodied intelligence paradigm where humans provide execution, AI contributes reasoning and planning, and wearable hardware enables continuous process capture and communication. APEX system implements this through mixed-reality, observing human actions, aligning with procedures, providing 3D guidance, and analyzing steps.

Result: APEX system achieves context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal LLMs, corrects errors in real-time, and successfully transfers expertise to beginners in cleanroom flexible electronics fabrication.

Conclusion: Establishes a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning into the physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

TL;DR: The paper presents a system that uses foundation models (LLMs and VLMs) to automatically generate reward functions for RL agents in autonomous racing, given text instructions, achieving performance competitive with champion-level agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing reward functions for RL agents is challenging, especially in complex environments like autonomous racing. The paper aims to automate this process using foundation models to interpret text instructions and generate effective reward functions.

Method: Combines LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human feedback to search over reward function spaces and produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo 7 racing game.

Result: The system produces racing agents competitive with GT Sophy (a champion-level RL racing agent) and generates novel behaviors, demonstrating practical automated reward design.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for practical automated reward design in real-world applications by leveraging foundation models to interpret human instructions and generate effective reward functions.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Deep Value Benchmark (DVB) is a framework that tests whether LLMs learn fundamental human values or just surface-level preferences by using controlled experiments that break correlations between deep values and shallow features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between AI systems that learn robust human values versus those that only capture superficial patterns, which is critical for AI alignment and preventing misaligned behavior.

Method: Uses a novel experimental design with training on preference data where deep values and shallow features are correlated, then testing by breaking these correlations to measure Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR).

Result: Across 9 models, average DVGR is 0.30 (below chance), with larger models performing slightly worse than smaller ones.

Conclusion: Current LLMs generalize deep values poorly, highlighting a core alignment challenge, and DVB provides an interpretable measure for evaluating this critical aspect.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent system that simulates human flood insurance decision-making by combining retrieval-augmented generation with reasoning capabilities to overcome LLMs' limitations in quantitative probability estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite flood insurance being an effective disaster mitigation strategy, participation rates among at-risk populations remain low, highlighting the need to better understand and model the behavioral mechanisms behind insurance decisions.

Method: The study constructs a benchmark dataset of insurance purchase probabilities and proposes InsurAgent - an agent with five modules: perception, retrieval (using RAG to ground decisions in survey data), reasoning (using LLM common sense for extrapolation), action, and memory (for simulating temporal decision evolution).

Result: While LLMs show qualitative understanding of insurance factors, they fail at quantitative probability estimation. InsurAgent successfully achieves accurate estimation of marginal and bivariate probabilities using RAG, and captures contextual information beyond survey data through reasoning.

Conclusion: InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral modeling and policy analysis by combining empirical data grounding with LLM reasoning capabilities to simulate realistic human decision-making processes in flood insurance contexts.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a

larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute

*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATHENA is a framework that combines symbolic utility functions with semantic adaptation to model personalized human decision-making, outperforming existing models in travel mode and vaccine choice tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual decision-making often differs from population-level predictions, especially in high-stakes scenarios like vaccine uptake, due to unique personal factors including both numerical attributes and linguistic influences.

Method: ATHENA uses a two-stage approach: 1) LLM-augmented symbolic discovery for group-level utility functions, and 2) individual-level semantic adaptation creating personalized semantic templates guided by optimal utility.

Result: ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based models, achieving at least 6.5% improvement in F1 score over the strongest baseline models in travel mode and vaccine choice tasks.

Conclusion: By integrating symbolic utility modeling with semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides an effective new approach for modeling human-centric decisions, with both stages being critical and complementary for optimal performance.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

TL;DR: STRMAC is a state-aware routing framework for multi-agent systems that adaptively selects the most suitable agent at each step, achieving 23.8% performance improvement and 90.1% reduction in data collection overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent systems with LLMs face limitations due to rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies that don't adapt to evolving task requirements, hindering their full potential.

Method: Separately encodes interaction history and agent knowledge to power a router that adaptively selects the most suitable single agent at each step. Uses a self-evolving data generation approach to accelerate collection of high-quality execution paths for training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on collaborative reasoning benchmarks with up to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reduced data collection overhead by up to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Conclusion: STRMAC provides an efficient and effective collaboration framework for multi-agent systems that adapts to task requirements while significantly reducing training data collection costs.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

TL;DR: The paper introduces PPP, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes productivity (task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and personalization (adapting to user preferences) for AI agents, achieving significant improvements over baselines like GPT-5.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses primarily on task success, but effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity, proactivity, and personalization to better serve user needs.

Method: Introduces UserVille (interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators) and PPP (multi-objective reinforcement learning approach) that jointly optimizes productivity, proactivity, and personalization.

Result: Experiments on software engineering and deep research tasks show agents trained with PPP achieve +21.6% average improvement over GPT-5, demonstrating strategic questioning, adaptation to unseen preferences, and better task success.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI agents.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

Motivation: Large language models underperform on complex tabular reasoning due to complex queries, noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities.

Method: Three-component framework: (1) query decomposer for breaking down complex questions, (2) table sanitizer for cleaning noisy tables, (3) program-of-thoughts reasoner that generates executable code for final answers.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and 19.87% accuracy improvements on TAT-QA, TableBench, and their new CalTab151 dataset respectively.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLM performance for complex tabular numerical reasoning and integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research ideation methods rely on simplistic statistical associations and fail to capture complex contextual relationships between scientific concepts, limiting their ability to effectively leverage knowledge from scientific literature.

Method: Proposes Deep Ideation framework with scientific network capturing keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, using explore-expand-evolve workflow with Idea Stack tracking and critic engine trained on real reviewer feedback.

Result: 10.67% improvement in generated idea quality compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference acceptance levels. Human evaluation confirms practical value in scientific research.

Conclusion: The Deep Ideation framework effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by integrating scientific concept networks and iterative refinement, demonstrating significant improvements in research idea generation quality and practical applicability.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

### [98] [When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243)
*Zhuoran Zhang,Tengyue Wang,Xilin Gong,Yang Shi,Haotian Wang,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework that decomposes modality following in MLLMs into relative reasoning uncertainty and inherent modality preference, revealing a universal law where modality following probability decreases with increasing relative uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work only measured modality following behavior with coarse dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in unimodal reasoning and failing to disentangle modality bias from unimodal capabilities.

Method: The authors constructed a controllable dataset that systematically varies visual and textual reasoning difficulty, used entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, and probed layer-wise predictions to reveal internal mechanisms.

Result: They discovered a universal law: modality following probability decreases monotonically with increasing relative uncertainty, and identified balance points that reveal inherent modality preferences. Layer-wise analysis showed oscillation between modalities in ambiguous regions.

Conclusion: Relative uncertainty and inherent preference are the two governing principles of modality following, providing both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into how MLLMs resolve conflicting information across modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning systems where one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining collaboration. The authors provide theoretical analysis of this issue, introduce causal influence measurement, and propose a verifiable reward mechanism to encourage deliberation and restart reasoning when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the critical limitation of lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning frameworks, where collaboration collapses into ineffective single-agent performance despite promising initial results.

Method: The method includes: 1) Theoretical analysis of lazy behavior in multi-agent reasoning, 2) Stable and efficient causal influence measurement, and 3) A verifiable reward mechanism that allows the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart reasoning when necessary.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully alleviates lazy agent behavior and unlocks the full potential of multi-agent frameworks for complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that their framework effectively mitigates lazy agent behavior in multi-agent reasoning systems, enabling better collaboration and improved performance on complex reasoning tasks through verifiable rewards and causal influence measurement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework for estimating entire Precision-Recall (PR) curves for generative models, addressing challenges in current evaluation methods that rely on scalar metrics. The approach uses a binary classification perspective and provides statistical analysis with minimax upper bounds on estimation risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative model evaluation methods mainly use scalar metrics, but PR curves offer richer analysis. However, estimating entire PR curves poses significant challenges that need to be addressed for more comprehensive model assessment.

Method: The authors propose a framework based on binary classification to estimate entire PR curves. They conduct thorough statistical analysis of the estimates and derive a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk.

Result: The framework extends several existing PR metrics from literature that were previously limited to extreme curve values. Experimental studies show different curve behaviors across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed binary classification-based framework enables comprehensive estimation of entire PR curves for generative models, providing richer analysis capabilities than scalar metrics and extending existing approaches beyond extreme curve values.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

TL;DR: ReAcTree is a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes complex goals into manageable subgoals using a dynamically constructed agent tree, with LLM agents handling subgoals and memory systems for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on monolithic trajectories that entangle all past decisions and observations, attempting to solve entire tasks in a single unified process.

Method: Proposes ReAcTree with hierarchical decomposition using dynamically constructed agent trees, where LLM agent nodes handle subgoals and control flow nodes coordinate execution strategies, integrated with episodic and working memory systems.

Result: Experiments on WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets show ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong baselines like ReAct across diverse LLMs, achieving 61% goal success rate on WAH-NL with Qwen 2.5 72B (nearly doubling ReAct's 31%).

Conclusion: ReAcTree effectively addresses limitations of monolithic planning approaches by enabling hierarchical decomposition and coordinated execution through agent trees with complementary memory systems, significantly improving performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes VMR (Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation) to extend RLVR training to open-ended tasks by converting them into verifiable multiple-choice formats, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods work well for tasks with standard answers (math, programming) but fail in open-ended tasks (creative writing, instruction following) where ground truth is unavailable, creating a gap in leveraging reasoning capabilities for such domains.

Method: VMR transforms open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling RLVR training without explicit ground truth by creating structured verification scenarios.

Result: Experimental validation across eight open-ended benchmarks shows average improvement of 5.99 points over baseline methods, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing LLM performance on open-ended tasks.

Conclusion: VMR successfully bridges the gap between RLVR training and open-ended tasks, proving that reasoning capabilities can be effectively transferred and improved even in domains lacking standard answers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Motivation: The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G networks makes manual optimization ineffective, requiring autonomous AI systems. There is currently no established framework for Agentic AI systems despite rapid advances.

Method: The paper outlines Agentic AI concepts, traces its evolution from classical agents, describes core design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration), and presents a practical 5G RAN case study using time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents.

Result: The paper provides a framework for Agentic AI in mobile networks, focusing on RAN management and optimization, demonstrating how intelligent behaviors can be orchestrated for autonomous decision-making.

Conclusion: Agentic AI represents a promising approach for automating complex network systems, with the proposed framework and RAN optimization case study contributing to ongoing research in 5G and 6G network automation.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated game testing caused by rapid iteration and frequent updates, where existing LLM-based methods lack structured knowledge accumulation for precise testing of incremental updates.

Method: Proposes KLPEG framework that constructs and maintains Knowledge Graph to model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships. Uses LLMs to parse update logs and perform multi-hop reasoning on KG to identify impact scope and generate tailored test cases.

Result: Experiments in Overcooked and Minecraft show KLPEG can more accurately locate affected functionalities and complete tests in fewer steps, improving both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: KLPEG framework successfully addresses incremental game update testing challenges through knowledge accumulation and reuse, enabling more precise and efficient automated playtesting.

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

### [107] [The ORCA Benchmark: Evaluating Real-World Calculation Accuracy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02589)
*Claudia Herambourg,Dawid Siuda,Anna Szczepanek,Julia Kopczyńska,Joao R. L. Santos,Wojciech Sas,Joanna Śmietańska-Nowak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA Benchmark evaluates LLMs on multi-domain quantitative reasoning using 500 natural-language tasks across finance, physics, health, and statistics. State-of-the-art models achieved only 45-63% accuracy, with major errors in rounding (35%) and calculation mistakes (33%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' quantitative reasoning capabilities across real-life domains using verified outputs from Omni's calculator engine, addressing limitations of standard math datasets by evaluating step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, and domain generalization.

Method: Developed ORCA Benchmark with 500 natural-language tasks across finance, physics, health, and statistics domains, using verified outputs from Omni's calculator engine to evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, and DeepSeek V3.2).

Result: Models achieved only 45-63% accuracy overall, with 35% errors from rounding issues and 33% from calculation mistakes. Performance varied by domain: strengths in mathematics and engineering, weaknesses in physics and natural sciences. Correlation analysis (r ≈ 0.40-0.65) showed models often fail together but make different error types.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in quantitative reasoning across real-life domains, with partial complementarity rather than redundancy in their error patterns. The benchmark reveals critical gaps in numerical precision and domain generalization that need addressing.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

### [108] [Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02605)
*Tiberiu-Andrei Georgescu,Alexander W. Goodall,Dalal Alrajeh,Francesco Belardinelli,Sebastian Uchitel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first adaptive shielding framework for reinforcement learning that automatically repairs GR(1) specifications online using Inductive Logic Programming when environment assumptions are violated, maintaining both safety and optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical static shielding approaches in RL assume fixed specifications and hand-crafted abstractions, but fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety issues.

Method: Developed an adaptive shielding framework based on GR(1) specifications that detects environment assumption violations at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically repair GR(1) specifications online in a systematic and interpretable way.

Result: In case studies (Minepump and Atari Seaquest), RL agents with adaptive shield maintained near-optimal reward and perfect logical compliance, while static symbolic controllers were severely suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards.

Conclusion: The adaptive shielding framework enables graceful evolution of shields, ensures liveness is achievable, and weakens goals only when necessary, outperforming static shields in both safety compliance and reward optimization.

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

### [109] [A Multi-Agent Psychological Simulation System for Human Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02606)
*Xiangen Hu,Jiarui Tong,Sheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent psychological simulation system that models cognitive-affective processes using established psychological theories to generate realistic human behaviors for training and education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-centered fields require authentic practice, but realistic simulations of human behavior have been limited. Current neural models lack transparency and psychological grounding.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system grounded in psychological theories (self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism) with an 'inner parliament' of agents representing key psychological factors that deliberate to determine behavior.

Result: The system enables unprecedented transparency and alignment with human psychology, generating believable human behaviors for applications like teacher training and research.

Conclusion: This approach embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and meta-cognition, providing a psychologically-grounded alternative to black-box neural models for human behavior simulation.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

*Lachlan McPheat,Navdeep Kaur,Robert Blackwell,Alessandra Russo,Anthony G. Cohn,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecompSR is a large benchmark dataset and generation framework for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning in LLMs, featuring over 5 million datapoints with independent control over productivity, substitutivity, overgeneralization, and systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rigorous benchmark for analyzing compositional spatial reasoning abilities in Large Language Models, addressing the need for provably correct datasets that can independently vary key aspects of compositionality.

Method: Procedural generation framework that creates a correct-by-construction dataset, independently verified using symbolic solvers. The framework allows independent variation of productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity/linguistic variability), overgeneralization (input order, distractors), and systematicity (novel linguistic elements).

Result: Benchmarking across multiple LLMs reveals that models struggle with productive and systematic generalization in spatial reasoning tasks, while being more robust to linguistic variation.

Conclusion: DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking tool for fine-grained analysis of compositional reasoning abilities in LLMs, enabling robust probing of their spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

### [111] [The Collaboration Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02687)
*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a collaborative maze-solving benchmark to evaluate AI agent collaboration, revealing a 'collaboration gap' where models that perform well alone degrade when working together, and proposes solutions like 'relay inference' to improve collaborative performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI development increasingly relies on agent-based systems with heterogeneous agents having different information, privileges, and tools, effective collaboration becomes crucial. However, few empirical studies have evaluated agent-agent collaboration at scale, creating a need for systematic evaluation frameworks.

Method: The authors propose a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that isolates collaborative capabilities, modulates problem complexity, enables scalable automated grading, and preserves ecological plausibility. They evaluate 32 leading open- and closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings.

Result: Results reveal a 'collaboration gap' - models performing well solo often degrade substantially when collaborating. Small distilled models that solve mazes well alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. Starting with the stronger agent improves outcomes, motivating a 'relay inference' approach that closes much of the performance gap.

Conclusion: The findings argue for collaboration-aware evaluation, training strategies to enhance collaborative capabilities, and interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent skills. This guidance applies to both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration scenarios.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

### [112] [CostBench: Evaluating Multi-Turn Cost-Optimal Planning and Adaptation in Dynamic Environments for LLM Tool-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02734)
*Jiayu Liu,Cheng Qian,Zhaochen Su,Qing Zong,Shijue Huang,Bingxiang He,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench is a new benchmark that evaluates LLM agents' cost-optimal planning and replanning abilities in travel planning scenarios with dynamic events, revealing significant gaps in current models' economic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent evaluations focus mainly on task completion while neglecting resource efficiency, adaptability, and cost-optimal planning in changing environments.

Method: Developed CostBench - a scalable, cost-centric benchmark in travel planning domain with customizable tool costs and four types of dynamic blocking events (tool failures, cost changes) to simulate real-world unpredictability.

Result: Evaluation of leading models shows substantial gaps: agents frequently fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings (GPT-5 achieves <75% exact match on hardest tasks), with performance dropping ~40% under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: CostBench diagnoses weaknesses in current agents' economic reasoning and lays groundwork for developing more economically rational and robust future agents.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

### [113] [Using Span Queries to Optimize for Cache and Attention Locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02749)
*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces span queries as a generalized interface for inference servers to handle diverse non-chat workloads like RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic tasks, achieving 10-20x TTFT reductions and improved accuracy through automatic optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference servers are heavily optimized for chat completion but clients are evolving to include various inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. Prior solutions are limited to single use cases like RAG, creating a need for a more generalized approach.

Method: Introduces span queries - expression trees of inference calls with commutativity constraints. Shows how chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads can be expressed as span queries. Implements a small modification to vLLM (492 lines) to enable high-performance execution.

Result: Span queries achieve 10-20x reductions in Time To First Token (TTFT) for non-chat use cases. Attention-optimized span queries on a 2b parameter model outperform stock inference servers using 8b models in accuracy.

Conclusion: Span queries provide a unified interface that generalizes across diverse inference workloads, enabling significant performance improvements and better resource utilization through automatic optimization of KV cache locality and attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering requires new approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge for better accessibility and collaboration.

Method: Uses language models to transform natural-language descriptions and mathematical definitions (LaTeX source code) into formalized knowledge graphs based on the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework.

Result: Demonstrated generation of an "interactive semantic layer" to enhance source documents and facilitate knowledge transfer in control engineering.

Conclusion: This approach contributes to creating easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for the control engineering domain.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A diagnostic framework for analyzing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that identifies modality sabotage - when one modality's high-confidence error overrides other evidence and misleads the final prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs' reasoning traces are opaque, making it unclear which modality drives predictions, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. The authors aim to expose these dynamics through systematic analysis.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, model-agnostic evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent producing candidate labels and self-assessments. A simple fusion mechanism aggregates outputs to identify contributors (supporting correct outcomes) and saboteurs (misleading modalities).

Result: Case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, showing whether failures arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing possible interventions to improve MLLM reliability.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to optimize attack policies for AI control evaluations by decomposing attack capability into five skills and using probabilistic modeling to overcome data limitations in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, there's a growing need to estimate their risk through AI control frameworks, which require strong attack policies that are challenging to develop in data-poor environments due to compute constraints.

Method: Decompose attack capability into five constituent skills (suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution, and subtlety), develop a probabilistic model of attack dynamics to optimize hyperparameters in simulation, and transfer results to SHADE-Arena environments.

Result: The method achieved substantial improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87 to 0.41 using the proposed scaffold.

Conclusion: The approach successfully demonstrates how to optimize attack policies for AI control evaluations by skill decomposition and probabilistic modeling, effectively overcoming data limitations in complex agentic environments.

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

TL;DR: Kosmos is an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery through iterative cycles of data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation, capable of running for up to 12 hours and producing traceable scientific reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agents for scientific research are limited in the number of actions they can take before losing coherence, restricting the depth of their findings. The goal is to create an AI system that can pursue open-ended scientific objectives over extended periods while maintaining coherence.

Method: Kosmos uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis agent and a literature search agent, enabling coherent pursuit of objectives over 200 agent rollouts. It performs parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation cycles, citing all statements with code or primary literature.

Result: Kosmos executed an average of 42,000 lines of code and read 1,500 papers per run. Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate. A single 20-cycle run performed the equivalent of 6 months of human research time, with valuable findings scaling linearly with cycles (up to 20 cycles tested).

Conclusion: Kosmos successfully made seven discoveries spanning multiple scientific fields, with three independently reproducing findings from unpublished manuscripts and four making novel contributions to scientific literature, demonstrating the viability of AI-driven scientific discovery at scale.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

*Artur d'Avila Garcez,Simon Odense*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that logic provides a semantic framework for AI-based science, particularly for deep learning, addressing the lack of semantics in current AI approaches. It introduces a neurosymbolic framework that formally maps neural networks to logical semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI lacks semantics, making scientific discoveries unsatisfactory. There's a need to formalize AI-based science to translate insights into comprehensible scientific knowledge and provide semantics for deep learning technologies.

Method: Uses logic in a neurosymbolic framework to provide semantics for deep learning. Introduces a framework for semantic encoding that explicitly maps neural networks to logic and characterizes existing encoding and knowledge extraction approaches.

Result: The paper provides a formal definition of the semantic encoding framework, reviews prominent neural encoding and knowledge extraction techniques, and demonstrates how logical semantics and neural networks are linked.

Conclusion: Logic offers an adequate framework for providing semantics to AI-based science, particularly addressing the semantic gaps in deep learning through neurosymbolic approaches, though practical identification of semantic encodings faces challenges similar to those in philosophy of mind.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent-Omni is a framework that coordinates existing foundation models through a master-agent system to enable flexible multimodal reasoning without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are limited to fixed modality pairs, require costly fine-tuning with large aligned datasets, and lack robust reasoning support for fully omni-capable models integrating text, images, audio, and video.

Method: The framework uses a master agent that interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their outputs into coherent responses, enabling seamless integration of specialized foundation models without retraining.

Result: Extensive experiments show Agent-Omni consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning, while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: The agent-based design provides modular and easily extensible framework for scalable omni-modal reasoning, allowing future integration of stronger models as they become available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,
audio, video, and omni benchmarks show that Agent-Omni consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support
continued research on scalable and reliable omni-modal reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in current flow matching-based MLLMs like BAGEL, which suffer from detail degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to random noise initialization.

Method: Proposes LGCC with two components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) to preserve spatial details by modeling target image embeddings and locally perturbed counterparts as coupled pairs, and Content Consistency Loss (CCL) to ensure semantic alignment between edit instructions and image modifications. Integrated with BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning.

Result: Significantly reduces inference steps, improves local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall scores by 0.53%. Achieves 3x-5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x for universal editing, requiring only 40%-50% of the inference time of BAGEL or Flux.

Conclusion: LGCC effectively preserves detail, maintains contextual integrity, and enhances inference speed, offering a cost-efficient solution without compromising editing quality in flow matching-based MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements have demonstrated the great potential of flow
matching-based Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in image editing.
However, state-of-the-art works like BAGEL face limitations, including detail
degradation, content inconsistency, and inefficiency due to their reliance on
random noise initialization. To address these issues, we propose LGCC, a novel
framework with two key components: Local Gaussian Noise Coupling (LGNC) and
Content Consistency Loss (CCL). LGNC preserves spatial details by modeling
target image embeddings and their locally perturbed counterparts as coupled
pairs, while CCL ensures semantic alignment between edit instructions and image
modifications, preventing unintended content removal. By integrating LGCC with
the BAGEL pre-trained model via curriculum learning, we significantly reduce
inference steps, improving local detail scores on I2EBench by 1.60% and overall
scores by 0.53%. LGCC achieves 3x -- 5x speedup for lightweight editing and 2x
for universal editing, requiring only 40% -- 50% of the inference time of BAGEL
or Flux. These results demonstrate LGCC's ability to preserve detail, maintain
contextual integrity, and enhance inference speed, offering a cost-efficient
solution without compromising editing quality.
