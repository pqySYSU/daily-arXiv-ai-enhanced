Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves\nremarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to\ndownstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current\nmethods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by\ngradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during\nfine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located\nweights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which\nresults in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the\noptimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to\novercome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates\nthe weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two\nlow-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by\nintroducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the\nresulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,\nenabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant\nweights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that\nencourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their\nimportance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted\non classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different\npre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA\nperformance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.\n90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.\nCompared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%\nacross models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

Our\n  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the\nmedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they\n  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of\ndistinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation\n  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core\ndecision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform\n  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the\ncognitive complexity found in real-world medical\n  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and\nemphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine\n  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the\nrelated code in the following repository:https:\n  //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor", "AI": {"tldr": "Role prompts in LLMs for medical decision support primarily affect linguistic style rather than enhancing reasoning capabilities, failing to replicate real-world cognitive complexity.", "motivation": "To investigate whether role prompts in LLMs induce distinct cognitive processes or merely modify linguistic style in medical decision support systems.", "method": "Introduced RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework (RPNA) using neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques on three medical QA datasets.", "result": "Role prompts do not significantly enhance medical reasoning abilities; they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features without distinct reasoning pathways across clinical roles.", "conclusion": "Current Prompt-Based Role Playing methods fail to replicate cognitive complexity in medical practice, highlighting the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation."}}

Performance varies significantly across games based on interaction complexity, and few-shot examples substantially improve performance.", "conclusion": "LLMs show promise for VR manipulation tasks but require targeted enhancement to match human capabilities in procedural reasoning and spatial understanding, with few-shot learning offering a viable path for improvement."}}

For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a\nnew generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the\ntraining protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new\nmodel, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities\nand categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual\nopen-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We\ndemonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture\nwith a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM\nand ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our\ndecoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in\nerror span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging\nbaseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we\ninstruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,\nthus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents two new models for WMT25 Translation Evaluation: MetricX-25 for quality score prediction and GemSpanEval for error span detection, both based on Gemma 3 and fine-tuned on WMT data.", "motivation": "To improve translation evaluation by developing enhanced systems for both quality score prediction and error span detection tasks in the WMT25 shared task.", "method": "Used Gemma 3 as base model, with MetricX-25 adapted to encoder-only architecture with regression head for quality scores, and GemSpanEval as decoder-only model for generative error span detection including context output.", "result": "MetricX-25 significantly outperforms its predecessor in predicting MQM and ESA quality scores, while GemSpanEval is competitive with xCOMET in error span detection.", "conclusion": "Both proposed systems demonstrate strong performance in their respective tasks, with MetricX-25 showing significant improvements over previous versions and GemSpanEval achieving competitive results in error span detection through generative formulation."}}
