### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper develops an analytical framework to determine when AI capability growth could escalate without bound (runaway growth) versus when it can be bounded, providing testable conditions and practical safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace speculation about AI 'runaway growth' or 'singularity' with precise, testable conditions that determine when capability escalation could become unbounded in finite time versus when it can be ruled out.

Method: Develops an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement linking capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Uses physical and information-theoretic limits (power, bandwidth, memory) to define a service envelope. Creates an endogenous growth model coupling capital to compute, data, and energy, with decision rules based on observable metrics.

Result: Derives falsifiable tests based on acceleration rates relative to current capability levels. Provides directly implementable safety controls including power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies demonstrate when the envelope binds and when it doesn't.

Conclusion: The framework replaces speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity, though limitations exist regarding capability metrics and regularity diagnostics.

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery has procedural variability, difficult learning curves, and complications affecting outcomes. Video-based assessment can provide data-driven insights to reduce variability and improve surgical performance, but existing tools lack standardization.

Method: Used Delphi process to achieve consensus on workflow descriptors, developed ColoWorkflow tool, applied it to 54 multicentre colorectal surgery videos, and evaluated applicability and inter-rater reliability.

Result: Achieved consensus on 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps. ColoWorkflow showed broad applicability with moderate inter-rater reliability (mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases, 0.66 for steps). Most discrepancies occurred at phase transitions and step boundaries.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow is the first validated, consensus-based VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive colorectal surgery, enabling standardized performance assessment, benchmarking, and supporting AI-driven workflow recognition for improved training and quality.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To further reduce trainable parameters in parameter-efficient fine-tuning for point cloud data, as general PEFT approaches are suboptimal for this domain.

Method: Learns dynamic graphs from initial tokenized transformer inputs using lightweight graph convolution networks, then passes graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show GFT rivals existing methods on object classification and segmentation tasks while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: GFT successfully reduces parameter count while maintaining competitive performance in point cloud tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of point-cloud-specific PEFT approaches.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Result: The proposed method achieves pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods while maintaining high pruning rates, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: The new LRP-based pruning approach successfully addresses the accuracy degradation issues of existing methods, providing a more effective solution for model compression in resource-constrained environments with limited data availability.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: YOLO-Drone demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and speed for drone-based object detection, making it an effective solution for the challenges of high-altitude aerial imagery.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.

*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin is a novel phase-window search algorithm for efficient and faithful region attribution in object-level foundation models, achieving near-linear complexity while maintaining high faithfulness comparable to greedy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods based on submodular subset selection have high faithfulness but suffer from efficiency limitations that hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios.

Method: PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search approach, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to approximate greedy behavior while reducing model evaluations.

Result: PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Conclusion: PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models, enabling practical deployment with near-linear complexity.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

### [11] [Out-of-Distribution Detection with Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10923)
*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision (PNPS) to improve OOD detection by using LLM-initialized prompts that capture inter-class features and transfer semantic knowledge to visual modality through a graph-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current negative prompts in vision-language models for OOD detection often include broad non-ID features, leading to suboptimal performance due to overlapping or misleading information capture.

Method: Uses class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by LLMs, optimizes them to focus on intra-class features (positive) and category boundaries (negative), and employs a graph-based architecture to transfer semantic supervision to visual modality for energy-based OOD detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K across eight OOD datasets and five LLMs show the method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed PNPS method effectively enhances OOD detection performance by better capturing inter-class features and transferring semantic knowledge between modalities.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial Expression Recognition remains challenging in real-world environments, and there's a need for lightweight models that can balance performance and efficiency for real-time, resource-constrained applications.

Method: Converted FER2013 and KDEF classification datasets to object detection format and evaluated YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n nano variants using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices within a unified detection and classification framework.

Result: YOLOv12n achieved highest overall performance on KDEF (mAP 0.5: 95.6) and outperformed YOLOv11n on FER2013 (mAP: 63.8). YOLOv11n showed higher precision (65.2) on FER2013. Both models showed more confusion between similar expressions on FER2013 compared to clearer separation on KDEF.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models effectively balance performance and efficiency, demonstrating adaptability across controlled and real-world conditions, making them strong candidates for real-time emotion-aware AI applications.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [13] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCD is a novel heterogeneous knowledge distillation framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits, using sub-logit decoupled distillation and orthogonality loss to enhance knowledge transfer efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD methods struggle with heterogeneous architectures due to differences in spatial feature representations, while existing heterogeneous KD approaches often have high computational costs, complex designs, or over-reliance on logit alignment, limiting their ability to leverage complementary features.

Method: Proposes Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD) with Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) that processes student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates with teacher's features, and maps to shared logits. Introduces Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions shared logits into n sub-logits fused with teacher's logits, and Orthogonality Loss (OL) to ensure sub-logit diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Fine-grained datasets (e.g., CUB200) and ImageNet-1K demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods.

Conclusion: HCD effectively addresses heterogeneous knowledge distillation challenges by preserving student-specific strengths while leveraging teacher knowledge, enhancing robustness and generalization in students.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Method: Proposes FedBCS with frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration for prototype construction that decouples content-style representations, and a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different encoder/decoder layers.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate remarkable performance improvements.

Conclusion: FedBCS effectively bridges feature representation gaps in federated medical image segmentation through domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

TL;DR: SandboxVLM bridges the 3D reasoning gap in vision-language models by using abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics, achieving significant improvements in spatial intelligence without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with 3D-related tasks like spatial cognition and physical understanding due to the modality gap between 3D tasks and 2D training, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications such as robotics.

Method: Introduces a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline with four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning using abstract bounding boxes.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in spatial intelligence across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, with an 8.3% gain on SAT Real compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Equipping VLMs with 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, opening new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

*Ren Zhang,Huilai Li,Chao qi,Guoliang Xu,Tianyu Zhou,Wei wei,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM is a multimodal LLM approach for micro expression recognition that addresses motion-semantic alignment through multi-expert disentanglement and a motion-driven instruction dataset called Uni-MER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MER methods face challenges with entangled static/dynamic facial cues and semantic gaps between text labels and actual facial muscle movements, limiting their ability to capture subtle emotional expressions.

Method: Proposes DEFT-LLM with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics representations, using Uni-MER dataset with optical flow and AU constraints for motion-text alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MER benchmarks and demonstrates superior interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: The approach successfully injects physical priors for micro expressions while leveraging LLM reasoning capabilities, enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues through motion-semantic alignment.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: LGRLN is a novel video summarization method that uses language-guided graph representation learning to capture global dependencies and enable multimodal user customization, achieving superior performance with significant reductions in inference time and model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization, while temporal proximity between frames doesn't always correspond to semantic proximity.

Method: Proposes a Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) with: video graph generator converting frames into structured graphs (forward, backward, undirected); intra-graph relational reasoning with dual-threshold graph convolution; language-guided cross-modal embedding for text-based customization; and modeling summary generation as Bernoulli distribution mixture solved with EM algorithm.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks, reduces inference time by 87.8% and model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: LGRLN effectively addresses challenges in video summarization by leveraging graph-based representation learning and language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

TL;DR: TG-DFER is a text-guided weakly supervised framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that uses vision-language models and multi-grained temporal modeling to address the many-to-one labeling problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in dynamic facial expression recognition, particularly the many-to-one labeling problem where videos with multiple frames get single emotion labels, and the limitations of Multiple Instance Learning approaches in handling visual diversity and temporal complexity.

Method: Proposes TG-DFER framework that integrates vision-language pre-trained models for semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions, uses visual prompts to align text and visual features, and employs multi-grained temporal network to capture both short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow.

Result: Extensive experiments show that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed text-guided weakly supervised framework effectively addresses the challenges in dynamic facial expression recognition by leveraging semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance in generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE introduces a novel sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture that replaces learned gating with eigenbasis-based routing using cosine similarity, eliminating the need for explicit load-balancing losses while improving performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address core challenges in MoE architectures: misalignment between router logits and expert internal structures causing unstable routing/expert underutilization, and load imbalances creating bottlenecks. Standard load-balancing solutions weaken expert specialization and hurt performance.

Method: Reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an 'Eigenbasis Score' - the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing directly ties token assignments to experts' representation spaces.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (COCO, Flickr30K), produces flatter expert load distributions naturally. ERMoE-ba variant improves brain age prediction accuracy by >7% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

Conclusion: ERMoE introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization, removing the need for explicit balancing losses and their interfering gradients.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

### [20] [Preserving Cross-Modal Consistency for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10974)
*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC is a two-stage framework for CLIP-based class-incremental learning that decouples vision encoder adaptation from textual prompt optimization to prevent classifier bias, with DMC-OT adding optimal-transport calibration to handle distributional drift in memory statistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending vision-language models like CLIP to continual learning settings is challenging due to classifier bias from task-specific soft prompts overfitting to recent classes when prior data is unavailable, and distributional drift in stored memory statistics when vision encoders are updated.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) adapt vision encoder with frozen text prompts, 2) optimize textual soft prompts with frozen vision encoder. DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration to align memory statistics across evolving encoders and task-specific prompting for better inter-task separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 show state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by an average of 1.80% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DMC framework effectively addresses classifier bias in CLIP-based CIL through decoupled modality adaptation, and DMC-OT further enhances performance by handling distributional drift in memory statistics via optimal-transport calibration.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video LLMs suffer from temporal instability due to multimodal RoPE's inverse Fourier time kernel causing frame-scale ripples. The paper introduces Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a training-free method that applies opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregates outputs to smooth the temporal kernel while preserving spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs exhibit temporal inconsistency where small frame timing shifts can disrupt attention and suppress relevant frames, traced to issues with Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) extension to video through multimodal RoPE.

Method: Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) - applies small opposed phase offsets across attention heads and aggregates their outputs, smoothing the temporal kernel without changing positional encoding structure. The method preserves per-head spectrum magnitude while reducing phase sensitivity.

Result: Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts.

Conclusion: PAS offers a plug-and-play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs, effectively addressing temporal instability through phase aggregation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision tasks that converts open-ended queries into multiple-choice questions and then into True/False verifications, significantly improving accuracy across various vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a practical, drop-in solution for improving zero-shot vision performance with off-the-shelf VLMs without requiring task-specific training, emphasizing inference-time design over training.

Method: Two-step workflow: (1) Quantization - converts open-ended queries into multiple-choice questions with explicit candidates; (2) Binarization - asks True/False questions per candidate and resolves deterministically, reverting to MCQ if needed.

Result: Significant improvements across all evaluated tasks (referring expression grounding, spatial reasoning, BLINK-Jigsaw) with quantization providing large gains and binarization offering consistent additional boost.

Conclusion: The workflow provides a simple, unified approach that emphasizes inference-time design and offers a practical path to stronger zero-shot vision capabilities with current VLMs.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

*Daxin Li,Yuanchao Bai,Kai Wang,Wenbo Zhao,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HPAC, a hierarchical parallel autoregressive framework that makes pure autoregressive models practical for lossless image compression through computational optimizations and progressive adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are theoretically optimal for lossless image compression but have been considered impractical due to prohibitive computational costs. The authors aim to re-establish pure autoregression as a practical and top-performing solution.

Method: Developed HPAC with hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating. Introduced Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI) for acceleration and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC) for high bit-depth images. Used Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT) for instance-level adaptation.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art compression performance across diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical). The approach significantly outperforms existing methods with small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: Carefully designed autoregressive frameworks can offer substantial gains in learned lossless compression, demonstrating that pure autoregression can be both practical and superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

*Keunwoo Park,Jihye Chae,Joong Ho Ahn,Jihoon Kweon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE is a generative model framework that achieves diverse and stable image generation using fixed-format prompts without additional data, particularly effective for specialized domains like medicine with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods face limitations in specialized fields like medicine where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available, requiring solutions that work with constrained datasets.

Method: Based on Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE uses a Style Encoder to generate style embeddings from images and prompts, feeding them into a new second attention layer in U-Net. It employs Kullback-Leibler divergence to achieve continuous representation of image features in Gaussian regions independent of prompts.

Result: On otitis media dataset, CLUE reduced FID from 46.81 to 9.30 and improved recall from 49.60% to 70.29%. Synthetic-only training at 1000% scale achieved F1 score of 83.21% vs 73.83%, and combining synthetic with real data achieved 94.76% F1 score, outperforming real-only data.

Conclusion: CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications, demonstrating superior performance on both internal and external medical datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

### [25] [PROMISE: Prompt-Attentive Hierarchical Contrastive Learning for Robust Cross-Modal Representation with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10997)
*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE is a novel multimodal framework that uses prompt-attentive hierarchical contrastive learning to maintain robust cross-modal representations when certain modalities are missing, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models perform poorly when modalities are missing due to inconsistent representation learning between complete and incomplete data scenarios. Existing generation-based approaches fail to preserve cross-modal consistency effectively.

Method: PROMISE incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with a prompt-attention mechanism that dynamically generates robust representations for missing modality scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show PROMISE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal methods, with comprehensive ablation studies validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed PROMISE framework successfully bridges the representational gap between complete and incomplete multimodal data, providing robust cross-modal representation learning under missing modality conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

TL;DR: EmoVid is the first multimodal emotion-annotated video dataset for creative media, enabling emotion-conditioned video generation that significantly improves both quantitative metrics and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation systems focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions, and there's a lack of dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, especially for stylized and non-realistic contexts.

Method: Created EmoVid dataset with emotion labels, visual attributes, and text captions; developed emotion-conditioned video generation by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model; conducted systematic analysis of spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions.

Result: Significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks; established new benchmark for affective video computing.

Conclusion: EmoVid provides valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos and practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation, establishing a foundation for affective video computing.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework that uses a question-conditioned utilization metric to measure and improve visual grounding in Large Vision-Language Models, reducing hallucinations without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses by relying too heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual evidence, highlighting the need for quantitative measurement of visual information utilization during reasoning.

Method: DnR framework uses a question-conditioned utilization metric that constructs relevance maps to localize question-specific cues and measures visual dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. It refines initial drafts using external visual experts whose outputs are rendered as visual cues, then selects responses with the largest utilization improvement.

Result: Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating improved visual grounding and interpretability.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems, enabling better visual grounding without architectural changes or retraining.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

*Xinlei Yu,Chengming Xu,Guibin Zhang,Zhangquan Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yongbo He,Peng-Tao Jiang,Jiangning Zhang,Xiaobin Hu,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisMem is a cognitive memory framework for Vision-Language Models that addresses visual processing bottlenecks by adding short-term perceptual and long-term semantic memory modules, improving performance by 11.8% across visual understanding, reasoning, and generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models suffer from a 'visual processing bottleneck' where they lose grounding in visual evidence and lack contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation, inspired by human cognitive memory theory.

Method: Proposes VisMem framework with dynamic latent vision memories: short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation, seamlessly invoked during inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show VisMem delivers 11.8% average performance boost relative to vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement in VLMs, maintaining both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

*Sumin Yu,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard is a new method for safer text-to-image generation that adaptively estimates prompt harmfulness and selectively guides only unsafe image regions, outperforming existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based T2I models enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack adaptivity (adjusting guidance strength based on prompt) and selectivity (targeting only unsafe regions).

Method: SP-Guard estimates prompt harmfulness and applies a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas of the image during generation.

Result: Experiments show SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration.

Conclusion: Beyond improving safety, the findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

*Siheon Joo,Hongjo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SUPER (Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction) is a plug-and-play decoder block that uses wavelet perfect reconstruction to prevent information loss in U-Net architectures, improving high-frequency detail recovery in inverse problems like crack segmentation and image denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) suffer from information loss that limits recovery of fine high-frequency details in inverse problems, creating a need for better reconstruction methods.

Method: Exploits perfect reconstruction property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing redundant features, serving as a plug-and-play decoder block for U-Net variants without rigid framelet constraints.

Result: Significantly improves thin-crack segmentation (especially for cracks <4px) on CrackVision12K, achieves moderate PSNR gains in smartphone image denoising on SIDD, and maintains comparable computational cost while enriching representational diversity.

Conclusion: SUPER provides a unified, reconstruction-aware framework that achieves high-frequency fidelity and global coherence across diverse U-Net variants, demonstrating plug-and-play generality across both high-frequency dominant and low-frequency prevalent settings.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AirCopBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging conditions, featuring 14.6k+ questions across 14 task types from simulator and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on single-agent vision tasks and fail to evaluate MLLMs in complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions, despite multi-drone systems offering enhanced coverage and collaboration.

Method: Constructed benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control across four task dimensions.

Result: Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals substantial room for improvement in MLLMs for collaborative perception, and fine-tuning experiments confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

*Yong Sun,Zhengjie Zhang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmbryoDiff is a two-stage diffusion-based framework for fine-grained embryo developmental stage classification in IVF, using multi-focal feature fusion and hybrid semantic-boundary conditioning to overcome limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for embryo stage classification fail to utilize developmental distribution priors and rely on single-focal information, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions.

Method: Two-stage framework: first trains a frame-level encoder for multi-focal feature extraction, then uses Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy to create 3D-aware representations, followed by Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block in diffusion-based denoising process.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on two benchmark datasets using only a single denoising step.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff effectively addresses feature ambiguity from cell occlusions and utilizes developmental priors, demonstrating superior performance in embryo stage classification for IVF applications.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: AI models can predict patients' health insurance type (proxy for socioeconomic status) from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy, revealing that medical images contain hidden social inequality signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether deep learning models can detect invisible traces of social inequality in medical images, challenging the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

Method: Used state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) trained on chest X-rays from MIMIC-CXR-JPG and CheXpert datasets, with patch-based occlusion analysis to localize signals.

Result: Models achieved AUC around 0.67-0.68 in predicting health insurance type, with signals persisting when controlling for age, race, and sex, and detectable even when trained on single racial groups. Signal was diffuse in upper and mid-thoracic regions.

Conclusion: Medical AI models internalize subtle traces of socioeconomic segregation from clinical environments and care pathways, requiring new approaches to fairness that interrogate and disentangle social fingerprints embedded in clinical data.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

*Lin Liu,Huixia Ben,Shuo Wang,Jinda Lu,Junxiang Qiu,Shengeng Tang,Yanbin Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) to improve efficiency of controllable generative models by using coarse-grained block-level cache for feature reuse and fine-grained prompt-level cache for cross-attention map reuse, reducing computational costs by 63% while maintaining visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable generative models face computational efficiency challenges due to the dual requirements of handling control conditions and content generation, leading to generally low generation efficiency.

Method: Hybrid-Grained Cache approach with: (1) coarse-grained block-level cache based on feature reuse to bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks, and (2) fine-grained prompt-level cache that reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to adjacent module computations.

Result: On COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, HGC reduces computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T) while keeping semantic fidelity loss within 1.5%. Validated effectiveness on four benchmark datasets with advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality.

Conclusion: HGC provides an effective solution for improving computational efficiency in controllable generative models through multi-granularity cache strategies that can be seamlessly integrated into computational links, achieving significant cost reduction with minimal quality degradation.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

TL;DR: MPCGNet introduces coupling gates and three novel modules to improve polyp segmentation by addressing noise filtering, feature importance selection, and small polyp detection challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome key challenges in polyp segmentation: missing small polyps, ambiguous boundaries, and noise from uneven lighting in colonoscopy images.

Method: Proposes coupling gates for noise filtering and feature selection, with three modules: CGMFE for local feature extraction and noise suppression, WCAD decoder for detail restoration, and DFA for progressive feature aggregation.

Result: Outperforms recent networks with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than second-best on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed MPCGNet effectively addresses polyp segmentation challenges through coupling gates and specialized modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossMed is a benchmark for evaluating compositional generalization in medical multimodal LLMs using a Modality-Anatomy-Task schema, showing significant performance drops in unrelated and zero-overlap scenarios while demonstrating cross-task transfer capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored ability of multimodal LLMs to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type in medical AI applications.

Method: Reformulated four public medical datasets (CheXpert, SIIM-ACR, BraTS 2020, MosMedData) into unified VQA format with 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances, evaluating models on Related, Unrelated, and zero-overlap MAT splits.

Result: Models achieved 83.2% classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU on Related splits, but performance dropped significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions. Cross-task transfer improved segmentation by 7% cIoU using classification-only data.

Conclusion: CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization, demonstrating multimodal LLMs' unique compositional generalization capabilities compared to traditional models.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT requires AI integration on weak embedded devices, but resource limitations and unreliable networks necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems that go beyond traditional bit-level transmission correctness approaches.

Method: Proposes SemanticNN with BER-aware decoder for dynamic channel adaptation, Soft Quantization-based encoder for compact representations, Feature-augmentation Learning for offloading efficiency, and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to handle encoder-decoder capability mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments on STM32 with three models and six datasets show SemanticNN reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy under varying transmission error rates.

Conclusion: SemanticNN provides an effective solution for compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading in IoT environments, significantly improving transmission efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

*Wenrui Li,Yidan Lu,Yeyu Chai,Rui Zhao,Hengyu Man,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H²ARN addresses text-3D retrieval challenges using hyperbolic space embeddings to preserve hierarchical relationships and reduce redundancy through contribution-aware aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-3D retrieval methods suffer from Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD), which compress hierarchical relationships and obscure critical semantic cues.

Method: H²ARN embeds text and 3D data in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, uses hierarchical ordering loss for entailment cones, instance-level contrastive loss, and contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation with Lorentzian distance weighting.

Result: The method is evaluated on the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark with 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, showing improved retrieval performance by preserving hierarchical distances and enhancing discriminative regions.

Conclusion: H²ARN effectively addresses HRC and RISD challenges in text-3D retrieval through hyperbolic embeddings and contribution-aware aggregation, achieving superior performance on the expanded benchmark.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PINGS-X is a novel framework that uses axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations for super-resolution of 4D flow MRI data, achieving faster training times and superior accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of cardiovascular conditions, but achieving this resolution leads to prolonged scan times. Existing PINNs approaches have slow training processes that must be performed for each patient, limiting practical applicability.

Method: PINGS-X extends 3D Gaussian splatting with three key innovations: normalized Gaussian splatting with convergence guarantee, axes-aligned Gaussians for high-dimensional data training, and Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and improve computational efficiency.

Result: Experimental results on CFD and real 4D flow MRI datasets show PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PINGS-X provides an efficient and accurate framework for 4D flow MRI super-resolution, overcoming the limitations of previous PINNs approaches by leveraging Gaussian representations with formal convergence guarantees and computational optimizations.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

### [40] [NP-LoRA: Null Space Projection Unifies Subject and Style in LoRA Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11051)
*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that prevents structural interference by enforcing subspace separation among principal directions, improving fusion quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods suffer from weight-based merging issues where one LoRA dominates the other, causing interference and degraded fidelity due to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations in low-rank subspaces.

Method: Extract principal style directions via SVD, project subject LoRA into orthogonal null space, and introduce soft projection mechanism for smooth control over subject fidelity vs style consistency trade-off.

Result: NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines across various metrics (DINO, CLIP, human and LLM preference scores), and works broadly across different backbones and LoRA pairs without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed NP-LoRA framework effectively addresses structural interference in LoRA fusion through subspace separation, enabling high-quality controllable generation while maintaining broad applicability across different models and LoRA combinations.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

*Jiaxuan Chen,Bo Zhang,Qingdong He,Jinlong Peng,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-reference generative image composition method that uses calibrated global and local features from multiple foreground reference images to improve detail preservation and pose/view adjustment when inserting objects into backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative image composition methods struggle with simultaneously preserving details and adjusting foreground pose/view when inserting objects into backgrounds.

Method: Extend generative composition model to multi-reference version, calibrate global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with background information, and use calibrated reference features to supplement original reference features.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom datasets demonstrate that generative models greatly benefit from calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-reference approach with calibrated features effectively addresses the challenges of detail preservation and pose/view adjustment in generative image composition.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

*Dor Shmilovich,Tony Wu,Aviad Dahan,Yuval Domb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention exploits temporal coherence in diffusion attention patterns to enable evolutionary computation skips across denoising steps, eliminating redundant attention computations while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers for video generation suffer from quadratic attention complexity causing prohibitive latency, with existing acceleration methods facing trade-offs between dynamic estimation overhead and static suboptimal patterns.

Method: Identifies temporal coherence in diffusion attention sparsity patterns, then implements LiteAttention that marks non-essential tiles early and propagates skip decisions forward across denoising steps, eliminating redundant computations without repeated profiling.

Result: Substantial speedups achieved on production video diffusion models with no degradation in quality, implemented as optimized kernel on top of FlashAttention.

Conclusion: LiteAttention combines adaptivity of dynamic methods with efficiency of static ones by exploiting temporal coherence, providing effective acceleration for video diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2D-Align is a novel SFT paradigm for radiology report generation that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment using auxiliary signals of varying granularities through a shallow-to-deep strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SFT fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment in radiology report generation due to the templated nature of reports, leading to sub-optimal generation quality.

Method: Uses a shallow-to-deep strategy: starts with coarse radiograph-report pairing, adds reference reports for instance-level guidance, then uses key phrases for anatomical grounding. Features a memory-based adapter for feature sharing between alignment stages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach.

Conclusion: S2D-Align presents a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks by progressively enriching alignment through varying granularities of auxiliary signals.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's no consensus on which generative model is best for 3D tasks, and conditional information like partial 3D data hasn't been thoroughly evaluated for steering generation processes.

Method: Adapted Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers for generative shape modeling and completion tasks, with thorough quantitative evaluation including baseline discriminative model and extensive ablation study.

Result: Diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both discriminative model and autoregressive approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from single noisy depth images. Autoregressive model matches or exceeds diffusion performance when compared on same discrete latent space.

Conclusion: Diffusion models excel with continuous latents for 3D shape tasks, while autoregressive models can achieve comparable performance in discrete latent spaces, providing guidance for model selection based on representation choice.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid dataset and validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical weather prediction models are computationally demanding and perform poorly at nowcasting timescales (0-4 hours), while AI-based weather prediction alternatives using neural networks remain underexplored for video understanding architectures.

Method: Proposed SaTformer - a video transformer architecture with full space-time attention, reformulated precipitation regression as classification, and used class-weighted loss to handle long-tailed datasets.

Result: Achieved first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge.

Conclusion: SaTformer demonstrates the effectiveness of video transformer architectures for extreme precipitation forecasting from satellite data, providing a promising alternative to traditional NWP models.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

TL;DR: This paper evaluates digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) as a scalable training alternative for coronary artery calcification detection, achieving competitive performance with lightweight CNNs and enhanced preprocessing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is the gold standard for CAC detection but is costly for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays lack reliable ground truth labels, limiting deep learning development.

Method: Generated synthetic DRRs from 667 CT scans, assessed model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies including curriculum learning.

Result: Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperformed large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yielded significant gains; best configuration achieved mean AUC of 0.754.

Conclusion: DRRs establish a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection and provide a basis for future transfer learning to real chest X-rays.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Conclusion: Process-aware modeling of perception and reasoning significantly enhances video reasoning capabilities, with perception output being information-sufficient for downstream reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of AI in media, particularly with GANs and diffusion models, has made it difficult to distinguish real from synthetic content.

Method: The study conducts a comprehensive review of 24 recent works on AI-generated media detection, examining each study individually to identify contributions and weaknesses. The review analyzes current deep learning approaches including CNNs and Vision Transformers that search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies.

Result: Current detection approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. Existing methods are also ineffective for multimodal data and highly modified content. The review identifies common limitations and key challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The paper suggests a research direction focused on multimodal deep learning models, which have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. This offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vectorized glyphs are essential for scalable design applications, and LLMs' sequence prediction capabilities can be leveraged for stroke-based vector character generation, addressing the need for efficient Chinese vector glyph creation.

Method: Encode strokes into discrete latent variables (stroke embeddings), then fine-tune DeepSeek LLM to predict next stroke embeddings, enabling generation from limited stroke inputs.

Result: Successfully generates complete vectorized Chinese characters, semantically elegant words, and unseen verses; demonstrates scaling behavior with data size; validation by experts confirms quality; releases large-scale Chinese SVG dataset with 907,267 stroke-based samples.

Conclusion: LVGM effectively bridges LLM capabilities with vector glyph generation, providing a scalable solution for Chinese vector character creation with practical applications in design and typography.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO) to elicit explicit multi-step reasoning in multimodal large language models for knowledge-based visual question answering, achieving superior performance without external APIs or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBVQA methods lack explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories from MLLMs, using either implicit knowledge via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval, but without clear reasoning processes.

Method: Proposes HinD framework with KEPO: 1) Uses hindsight wisdom by prompting frozen MLLM to construct Hindsight-Zero training data, 2) Self-distills into Chain-of-Thought and Knowledge Generators, 3) Optimizes Knowledge Generator with KEPO to prefer under-confident but helpful knowledge over over-confident unhelpful knowledge.

Result: Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show HinD achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge, using only 7B-size MLLM.

Conclusion: HinD framework successfully elicits and harnesses internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs through explicit multi-step reasoning trajectories, addressing the gap in existing KBVQA methods.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD is an improved image-to-image translation framework that uses optimal transport theory to address efficiency and distribution mismatch issues in DDIB methods, achieving 20.29% faster translation and 2.6 FID score improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of DDIB methods: low translation efficiency and trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions between source and target domains.

Method: Computes an optimal transport map from source to target latent distributions, using the mapped distribution as starting point for reverse diffusion in target domain, eliminating distribution mismatches.

Result: OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces FID score by 2.6 on average across four translation tasks on three high-resolution datasets.

Conclusion: OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved quality by eliminating latent distribution mismatches through optimal transport theory.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

### [55] [Reverberation: Learning the Latencies Before Forecasting Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11164)
*Conghao Wong,Ziqian Zou,Beihao Xia,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Reverberation (Rev) trajectory prediction model that explicitly learns and predicts temporal latencies in agent responses to trajectory-changing events, inspired by acoustic reverberation curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current trajectory prediction methods struggle to explicitly model temporal latencies - the delays with which agents respond to trajectory-changing events. Different agents have distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to events, and ignoring these latencies can undermine causal continuity and produce implausible trajectories.

Method: Proposes a reverberation transform and Rev trajectory prediction model that uses two explicit, learnable reverberation kernels to simulate and predict different latency preferences of each agent and their stochasticity, enabling controllable trajectory prediction based on forecasted latencies.

Result: Experiments on multiple pedestrian and vehicle datasets show that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses verify the properties of the reverberation transform.

Conclusion: The reverberation transform shows potential as a general latency modeling approach for trajectory prediction, providing interpretable latency dynamics while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD is a lightweight convolutional framework for explainable multi-type anomaly detection that uses image-level labels to generate multi-channel heatmaps for different anomaly types, eliminating the need for separate models per object category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable anomaly detection methods lack specificity in identifying anomaly types and require costly separate models for each object category, while existing VLMs are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time systems.

Method: A simple convolutional framework that uses only image-level labels to learn multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel corresponds to a specific anomaly type, functioning as a unified framework across multiple object categories.

Result: The method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art complex models on the Real-IAD dataset while significantly reducing parametric load and inference times.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD provides a practical and viable solution for real-world applications with constrained computational resources, offering explainable multi-type anomaly detection without the overhead of multiple specialized models.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V represents the largest, most comprehensive, and highest-quality dataset for V2V cooperative perception in complex adverse scenarios, expected to significantly benefit the autonomous driving community.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

*Ayush Pandey,Jai Bardhan,Ishita Jain,Ramya S Hebbalaguppe,Rohan Raju Dhanakshirur,Lovekesh Vig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignVQA is a debate-based multi-agent framework that improves confidence calibration in Visual Question Answering systems by having specialized VLMs with different prompting strategies generate answers, then engage in critique and refinement through generalist agents, resulting in more accurate confidence estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VQA systems using vision-language models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains but often produce overconfident responses with unreliable confidence estimates, which is problematic for autonomous decision-making under visual uncertainty.

Method: Proposes AlignVQA framework with specialized VLMs using distinct prompting strategies to generate candidate answers, followed by two-stage interaction where generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate proposals. Also introduces aligncal loss function to fine-tune specialized agents by minimizing calibration error upper bound.

Result: Empirical results across multiple VQA benchmarks show substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies, with more calibrated specialized agents producing better aligned confidences.

Conclusion: The debate-based multi-agent approach effectively improves confidence calibration in VQA systems, and the proposed differentiable calibration-aware loss function successfully enhances the fidelity of individual agents' confidence estimates.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A temporal alignment method for 4D Gaussian Splatting that handles unsynchronized multi-view videos through coarse-to-fine time shift estimation and compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view videos often suffer from temporal misalignment due to camera trigger delays or independent recording, which degrades reconstruction quality in 4DGS methods that assume synchronized inputs.

Method: Coarse-to-fine alignment module that first estimates frame-level offsets and then refines to sub-frame accuracy, designed as an integrable module for existing 4DGS frameworks.

Result: Effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal alignment strategy improves 4DGS robustness for asynchronous multi-view video data and can be readily integrated into existing frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

TL;DR: Viper-F1 is an efficient multimodal language model that replaces attention with liquid state-space dynamics for linear-time inference, achieving fine-grained vision-language understanding with improved computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational cost of existing multimodal LLMs and their inability to capture fine-grained visual regions for precise reasoning in resource-constrained scenarios like robotics and smart devices.

Method: Proposes a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model using Liquid State-Space Dynamics instead of attention, with a Token-Grid Correlation Module that computes lightweight text-image correlations and modulates state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning.

Result: Experimental results show Viper-F1 achieves accurate fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Viper-F1 successfully addresses efficiency and fine-grained reasoning limitations in multimodal models through state-space dynamics and selective visual grounding, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Method: Two-stage training: first stage trains ConvGRU to forecast brightness temperatures from SEVIRI infrared data; second stage applies nonlinear transformation to map predictions to rainfall rates. For event prediction, uses 3D event detection and spatiotemporal feature extraction.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in cumulative rainfall task. Same model performed similarly to baseline in event prediction task without modifications.

Conclusion: The ConvGRU-based transfer learning framework effectively captures spatiotemporal patterns for rainfall prediction using minimal input data, demonstrating strong performance in weather forecasting competitions and transferability across tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations that don't alter semantics, as current understanding of their reliability under minor input changes is limited.

Method: Large-scale systematic study across multiple models and datasets, testing robustness to pixel-level shifts, geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites.

Result: Modern VLMs are highly unstable under minor perturbations, with substantial sample changes in predicted answers. Stability patterns can predict correctness of larger closed-source models with high precision.

Conclusion: Current VLMs exhibit fundamental fragility, highlighting the need for robustness evaluations focusing on invariances models should uphold, beyond just adversarial perturbations.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Motivation: Address limitations of existing one-to-one backdoor attacks in 3D domains like autonomous driving and robotics by creating a more flexible multi-target threat framework.

Method: Use configurable spherical triggers as parameter space to encode multiple target classes, establishing theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D vision.

Result: Achieved high attack success rates (up to 100%) across multiple datasets and model architectures while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

Conclusion: Establishes crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

TL;DR: MAFM^3 is a modular framework that enables a single foundation model to adapt to multiple medical imaging domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight components, achieving improved performance in prognosis and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces data scarcity challenges for pre-training separate models for each domain, modality, or task, necessitating a unified approach for efficient adaptation.

Method: The framework uses lightweight modular components that serve as specialized skill sets, allowing flexible activation of appropriate capabilities at inference time based on input type or clinical objective.

Result: Adapting a chest CT foundation model achieved improved performance on both prognosis and segmentation tasks, and incorporating PET scans improved Dice score by 5% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Foundation models with modular components can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging, overcoming initial training scope limitations.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

*Ruocheng Wu,Haolan He,Yufei Wang,Zhihao Li,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) that uses Video Diffusion Models to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse training views by providing multi-view consistency supervision through corrected noise prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) suffers from overfitting when trained on sparse views due to lack of intermediate-view supervision, limiting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited input data.

Method: Proposes GSD framework that extracts multi-view consistency priors from pretrained Video Diffusion Models (VDM) and supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views. Introduces unified guidance with depth warp guidance (using real depth maps) and semantic image feature guidance to correct VDM's noise prediction for proper camera pose and geometry alignment.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets, showing improved performance in sparse view scenarios.

Conclusion: GSD effectively addresses the overfitting problem in 3DGS for sparse training views by leveraging VDM priors with corrected guidance, enabling better multi-view consistency and geometry accuracy in 3D scene representation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates positional bias in multimodal representation models, particularly in image-text retrieval, finding that such bias exists differently across modalities - text encoders favor the beginning while image encoders favor both beginning and end positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias has been shown to negatively impact model performance, but while extensively studied in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models and multimodal models remain underexplored.

Method: The researchers distinguish between context importance and positional bias, then assess positional bias across different models and datasets in multimodal representation models, specifically in image-text retrieval contexts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, with text encoders exhibiting bias toward the beginning of input, while image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end positions.

Conclusion: Positional bias in multimodal models arises from or is amplified by a combination of factors including positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze provides a superior method for creating synthetic training data and will be made available to the research community for benchmarking.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

### [70] [DoReMi: A Domain-Representation Mixture Framework for Generalizable 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11232)
*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi is a Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses multi-domain 3D point cloud learning by jointly modeling domain-aware experts and unified representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D deep learning faces limitations due to small datasets and heterogeneous multi-source point clouds from different sensors (LiDAR, mesh-derived) with varying density and noise, causing negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Existing approaches focus on either domain-aware or domain-general features separately, missing their synergistic potential.

Method: Proposes DoReMi framework with: 1) Domain-aware Experts branch activated via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing for context-aware expert selection, 2) Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation for stable expert utilization, 3) Frozen unified representation branch pretrained through multi-attribute self-supervised learning to preserve cross-domain geometric priors.

Result: Achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: DoReMi effectively enables cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge, showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research by adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions while maintaining global consistency.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

### [71] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model that groups caption tokens to capture fine-grained language representations, aligning them with object-level image features to improve vision-language understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models align image patches with individual tokens, but patches lack human meaning and tokens don't necessarily carry groundable information. Groups of tokens better describe scene aspects, so the authors aim to capture fine-grained language representations at the object level.

Method: Proposed a model that groups caption tokens as part of its architecture to create fine-grained language representations. These representations are aligned with the output of an image encoder trained for object discovery, enabling object-level alignment between vision and language.

Result: The model achieves better fine-grained understanding of vision and language by learning to group tokens. The discovered token groups are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: Grouping tokens to capture fine-grained language representations and aligning them with object-level image features significantly improves vision-language model performance and produces meaningful, groundable phrase-like groupings.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

### [72] [Parameter-Efficient MoE LoRA for Few-Shot Multi-Style Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11236)
*Cong Cao,Yujie Xu,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel few-shot style editing framework using Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with dual routing mechanisms for efficient multi-style fine-tuning with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image editing models often fail with new styles, and there's a need to effectively fine-tune them using limited paired data for different artistic styles.

Method: Proposed MoE LoRA with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms, automatic rank determination via metric-guided approach, optimal LoRA insertion in DiT model, and integration of adversarial learning and flow matching.

Result: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters across five distinct style benchmarks.

Conclusion: The MoE LoRA framework effectively addresses few-shot style editing by preventing style interference while learning common patterns, achieving superior performance with parameter efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using controlled synthetic data generation to fine-tune Vision-Language Models, addressing biases and distribution imbalance in real-world data, and shows improved performance on real-world benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome biases, errors, and distribution imbalance in real-world data collection for VLM fine-tuning, which leads to overfitting and imbalanced performance.

Method: Redesigns fine-tuning by: 1) controlling synthetic data generation with comprehensive sampling of object attributes (color, shape, size, position), and 2) fine-tuning VLMs on this balanced synthetic dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across visual scenes, mitigates biases, and significantly improves performance on real-world COCO data, outperforming models fine-tuned with matched real data.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic data generation is an effective strategy for VLM fine-tuning that addresses data quality issues and improves transferability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

*Zhongbin Guo,Jiahe Liu,Yushan Li,Wenyu Gao,Zhen Yang,Chenzhi Li,Xinyue Zhang,Ping Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE is a novel VLM architecture that addresses 3D spatial reasoning limitations by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation using two plug-and-play modules: DRM for spatial co-processing and DRH for precise continuous regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with real-world 3D spatial intelligence due to dual bottlenecks: input-stage conflict between geometric-aware encoders and 2D features, and output-stage misalignment where tokenizers can't produce precise continuous numerical values.

Method: GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that aligns 3D data with 2D features via cross-attention and distills spatial Chain-of-Thought logic into Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH) that uses Embedding-as-Value paradigm with lightweight MLP for precise continuous regression.

Result: The 1.5B parameter GEODE model achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models, functioning as a high-level semantic dispatcher.

Conclusion: GEODE successfully resolves the dual-bottleneck in VLMs for 3D spatial reasoning through its decoupled architecture, enabling efficient and precise spatial intelligence without requiring massive model scaling.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

TL;DR: A novel AI framework for gaze target detection in autistic children that uses social context to address class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance especially for face-directed gaze detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated systems for measuring joint attention in autistic children, addressing the challenge of reduced access to professionals and the tendency of autistic children to show reduced gaze to faces.

Method: Proposes a Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) framework with two-pathway architecture using expert models for social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. Uses the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in autistic children, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses class imbalance in autism datasets and demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging social context for improved gaze target detection in autistic populations.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer is a training-free method that improves text-to-image models' ability to generate correct object counts by steering cross-attention hidden states during inference, leveraging the model's latent awareness of numerical correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation, despite the models being implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy.

Method: CountSteer steers the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference based on the observation that models encode latent notions of numerical correctness, without requiring additional training.

Result: CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality in experiments.

Conclusion: CountSteer demonstrates a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation by harnessing the model's existing numerical awareness.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

*Fabian Schmidt,Markus Enzweiler,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-agnostic method that enhances vision-language models for autonomous driving by conditioning them on structured relational context through traffic scene graphs, leading to significant performance improvements without requiring scene graphs at test time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models for autonomous driving lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies between traffic entities, limiting their ability to understand spatial interactions and dynamic influences from multimodal sensor data.

Method: The approach serializes traffic scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, incorporating them into language-based driving models via structured prompt templates during training to provide relational supervision.

Result: Extensive evaluations on LangAuto benchmark show large improvements: up to 15.6% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver, demonstrating that models can better internalize relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training.

Conclusion: Scene graph conditioning enables vision-language models to better understand and ground relational dependencies in traffic scenarios, yielding persistent performance improvements in autonomous driving tasks without requiring scene graph input during inference.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time.

TL;DR: Φeat is a self-supervised visual backbone that learns physically-grounded representations sensitive to material identity by contrasting spatial crops and physical augmentations under varying shapes and lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors like geometry and illumination, which hinders their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning.

Method: Uses a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions, without explicit labels.

Result: The learned representations capture physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping and provide strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors.

Conclusion: Unsupervised physical feature learning shows promise as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

*Haoyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL is a novel method for volumetric medical image segmentation that captures continuous anatomical similarity and global directional consistency through contrastive ranking and ordinal objectives, achieving state-of-the-art performance with limited annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use hard binary thresholds that discard continuous anatomical similarity information and overlook global directional consistency, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients.

Method: Proposes Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) with two key components: 1) contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences; 2) ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning learned feature distribution with canonical anatomical progression.

Result: CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Conclusion: Learning inter-slice relationships through coordinative learning produces anatomically informed representations that benefit downstream segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of capturing both local and global structure in volumetric images.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

*Ruoqi Wang,Haitao Wang,Shaojie Guo,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP is a dataset-agnostic augmentation method that improves out-of-domain robustness by combining frequency-space and pixel-space augmentations guided by task gradients, outperforming both generic and dataset-specific augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-domain robustness is challenging due to shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains, while dataset-specific ones require expert knowledge. Neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts due to learning bias towards domain-specific frequency components.

Method: D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in frequency space from task gradients to identify how strongly the model responds to different frequency components. It adaptively interpolates amplitudes between source and target samples, then uses complementary pixel-space blending to restore fine spatial details.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: D-GAP effectively addresses out-of-domain robustness challenges by reducing learning bias in frequency space while preserving pixel-level details, providing a superior augmentation approach that doesn't require dataset-specific expertise.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark provides a novel simulation-free approach to robust image watermarking by leveraging the natural robustness of low-frequency components, achieving better performance than existing methods without requiring noise simulation during training.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training.

TL;DR: AUVIC is a novel visual concept unlearning framework for Multimodal Large Language Models that uses adversarial perturbations to precisely remove target visual concepts while preserving performance on related entities, addressing data privacy concerns and regulatory requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models trained on massive datasets raise data privacy concerns due to sensitive/copyrighted content, and regulatory frameworks require 'right to be forgotten' capabilities. While text unlearning is well-studied, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored.

Method: AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting of target visual concepts, effectively isolating the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. The authors also created VCUBench, the first benchmark for assessing visual concept unlearning in group contexts.

Result: Experimental results show AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurring minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: AUVIC provides an effective solution for visual concept unlearning in MLLMs, addressing privacy concerns and regulatory requirements while maintaining model performance on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

*Saptarshi Neil Sinha,Julius Kühn,Mika Silvan Goschke,Michael Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a 6D pose estimation system for strawberries using synthetic data from a procedural Blender pipeline and YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, achieving comparable accuracy on both high-performance and edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in automated fruit harvesting due to high costs and labor shortages in advanced economies, particularly focusing on strawberries.

Method: Uses YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm with synthetic training data generated through a procedural Blender pipeline that enhances realism compared to previous work.

Result: Models achieve comparable accuracy on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across ADD-S metrics, with RTX 3090 having superior speed but Jetson being suitable for resource-constrained agricultural robotics. Performs well on ripe and partially ripe strawberries but struggles with unripe ones.

Conclusion: The methodology is effective for strawberry pose estimation and can be adapted for other fruits like apples, peaches, and plums, with future improvements needed for detecting unripe strawberries through color variations.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models have strong multimodal reasoning but high memory footprint, making them impractical for resource-constrained edge devices.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82% fewer visual tokens, 75% fewer parameters, and 71% lower latency across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks.

Conclusion: DocSLM enables reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices through efficient compression and streaming processing techniques.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YCB-Ev SD is a synthetic dataset of 50,000 event-camera sequences at SD resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation, created using PBR rendering and BOP methodology with simulated linear camera motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive synthetic event-camera datasets comparable to those available for frame-based computer vision, particularly for 6DoF object pose estimation tasks.

Method: Generated 50,000 event sequences (34ms each) from Physically Based Rendering scenes of YCB-Video objects using BOP methodology, with simulated linear camera motion for complete scene coverage including background activity.

Result: Systematic evaluation showed time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, significantly outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives, with polarity information being the most substantial contributor to performance gains.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a comprehensive resource for event-based vision research with optimal event representations identified, facilitating immediate use and reproducible benchmarking in 6DoF object pose estimation.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free3D is a framework that generates realistic 3D human motions without using any 3D motion annotations, achieving comparable or better performance than fully supervised methods through 3D-free regularization objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human motion generation models struggle with generalization beyond training distributions due to over-reliance on precise 3D supervision, which encourages fitting fixed coordinate patterns rather than learning essential 3D structure and motion semantics.

Method: Proposes Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences to 3D-consistent latent spaces, combined with 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility.

Result: Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions with performance comparable to or surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts, despite being trained entirely on 2D motion data.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

*Julian Grolig,Lars Griem,Michael Selzer,Hans-Ulrich Kauczor,Simon M. F. Triphan,Britta Nestler,Arnd Koeppe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HMRF-UNet, a hybrid approach combining Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) with CNNs for unsupervised image segmentation, achieving high accuracy on μCT images of Polyurethane foam without ground truth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation methods lack accuracy or speed, while supervised CNNs require large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches suffer from slow segmentation and poor accuracy. The goal is to leverage advantages from both HMRF (unsupervised learning) and CNNs (fast segmentation).

Method: Integration of HMRF theory with CNN segmentation, investigating different neighborhood terms and components for unsupervised HMRF loss. Uses HMRF-UNet architecture and proposes a pre-training strategy to reduce ground-truth data requirements.

Result: HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on μCT image dataset of Polyurethane foam structures. The pre-training strategy considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The hybrid HMRF-UNet approach successfully combines unsupervised learning benefits with fast CNN segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing dependency on labeled datasets through effective pre-training strategies.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Jinyang Huang,Ziyu Jia,Xinyu Li,Xin Yan,Xiaokang Zhou,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSEF is a hierarchical framework that disentangles emotional bases and transient fluctuations using low-rank sparse modeling, significantly improving robustness and dynamic discrimination in video-based affective computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based Affective Computing suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics, lacking mechanisms to disentangle distinct affective components like emotional bases and transient fluctuations.

Method: Proposes LSEF with three modules: Stability Encoding Module captures low-rank emotional bases, Dynamic Decoupling Module isolates sparse transient signals, and Consistency Integration Module reconstructs multi-scale coherence, optimized by Rank Aware Optimization strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination in affective computing tasks.

Conclusion: The framework validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics in video-based emotion analysis.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

*Manyu Li,Ruian He,Chenxi Ma,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroVQA++ is a high-quality microscopy VQA dataset created through a three-stage process involving expert-validated data, graph-based filtering (HiCQA-Graph), and MLLM-generated questions with human screening, enabling competitive performance from smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for scientific reasoning in microscopy imaging, which limits the application of Multimodal Large Language Models in biomedical imaging.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Bootstrap supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs; 2) Apply HiCQA-Graph (heterogeneous graph over images, captions, QAs) with NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based alignment, and agent signals for filtering; 3) Use MLLM agent to generate MCQs followed by human screening.

Result: Created a quality-controlled dataset with large training split and human-checked test split that exceeds MicroVQA benchmark in Bloom's level hard-sample distribution. Enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance comparable to GPT-5 and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: Careful data construction through expert literature coupling, graph-based filtering, and human refinement enables smaller models to achieve competitive microscopy reasoning performance, providing a scalable approach for biomedical imaging applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Doc is a three-tiered evaluation framework that assesses Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels, revealing their limitations and showing that Chain-of-Thought prompting significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored despite their expanding capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks.

Method: Proposed Q-Doc framework with three evaluation levels: coarse level (quality score assignment), middle level (distortion-type identification with single/multi-choice tests), and fine level (distortion-severity assessment against human references).

Result: Evaluation shows MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities but exhibit critical limitations including inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Conclusion: The work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and identifying promising pathways for enhancement through techniques like CoT prompting.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA is a novel Class-Incremental Learning framework that adapts CLIP's cross-modal bridge-layer without adding parameters, using orthogonal low-rank fusion to prevent forgetting and cross-modal hybrid prototypes for enhanced classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in applying CLIP to CIL: avoiding additional learnable modules that increase complexity and forgetting, and better integrating visual and textual modalities for improved performance.

Method: Confines adaptation to CLIP's existing bridge-layer using Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion to constrain updates to a low-rank safe subspace orthogonal to past tasks, and employs cross-modal hybrid prototypes combining stable textual prototypes with adapted visual features.

Result: Extensive experiments show BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: BOFA effectively enables stable knowledge accumulation in CLIP-based CIL without data replay, demonstrating strong performance through parameter-free adaptation and cross-modal integration.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

### [93] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework to analyze how text-to-image diffusion models handle cultural references, distinguishing between recognizing references and how they're depicted (replication vs. reinterpretation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in diffusion models, specifically focusing on multimodal iconicity where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations like familiar artworks or film scenes.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework separating recognition (identifying references) from realization (how references are depicted), tested on 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references across five diffusion models, and conducted prompt perturbation experiments with synonym substitutions and literal descriptions.

Result: The framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. Models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Cultural alignment correlates with training data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: The value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

### [94] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adaptive teaching paradigm to address the asymmetric relationship between vision and EEG modalities, using a ShrinkAdapter module to help the vision modality dynamically adapt its knowledge structure to match EEG's capacity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in brain-to-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors argue that the relationship between visual and brain (EEG) modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two gaps: Fidelity Gap (EEG's noise vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and Semantic Gap (EEG's shallow representation vs. vision's rich semantics). Previous methods overlook this asymmetry, treating both modalities as equal partners and leading to poor generalization.

Method: Proposes an adaptive teaching paradigm where the vision modality (teacher) dynamically shrinks and adjusts its knowledge structure under task guidance to match the EEG modality's (student) capacity. Implements this with ShrinkAdapter - a residual-free module with bottleneck structure that tailors vision's semantically dense features to EEG's capacity.

Result: Achieves top-1 accuracy of 60.2% on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by 9.8%. Extensive experiments validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of the proposed paradigm.

Conclusion: Introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher modality must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap, rather than forcing equal alignment between fundamentally asymmetric modalities.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multilingual Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) system with a unified dataset spanning 10 languages and an attention-anchored neural architecture using multilingual SigLIP2 encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current REC research is predominantly English-centric despite increasing global deployment demands, creating a need for multilingual visual grounding systems.

Method: Constructed a multilingual dataset by expanding 12 English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based enhancement, and developed an attention-anchored architecture that generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions and refines them through learned residuals.

Result: Achieved 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation (compared to 91.3% for English-only), with consistent performance across 10 languages.

Conclusion: The work establishes the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems and provides a comprehensive dataset and model for multilingual REC research.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models suffer from randomness and inconsistency with vague prompts, and current solutions require additional modules that hinder test-time scaling efficiency and increase computational overhead.

Method: ImAgent uses a policy controller to guide multiple generation actions that dynamically interact and self-organize within a single framework, integrating reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation without external models.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImAgent consistently improves over backbone models and surpasses other baselines, even when the backbone model fails, demonstrating enhanced image fidelity and semantic alignment.

Conclusion: ImAgent highlights the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling, providing a training-free solution that outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

Motivation: Existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing.

Method: Created WEAVE-100k dataset with 100K interleaved samples spanning 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, and WEAVEBench benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images using a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework.

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities, facilitating emergent visual-memory capabilities in UMMs. WEAVEBench evaluations expose persistent limitations in current multi-turn, context-aware approaches.

Conclusion: WEAVE provides a foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation, addressing the gap in multi-turn multimodal interactions and revealing challenges in current approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [98] [PAS : Prelim Attention Score for Detecting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11502)
*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PAS, a training-free method that uses attention weights over previously generated tokens to detect object hallucinations in LVLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models suffer from object hallucinations where they ignore images and rely on previously generated tokens to infer new objects, making them unreliable.

Method: Proposes Prelim Attention Score (PAS) - a lightweight signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens during inference, requiring no additional forward passes.

Result: PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: The attention over previously generated tokens provides a reliable signal for detecting hallucinations, allowing for effective real-time intervention in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

### [99] [Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437)
*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM is a brain-inspired diffusion framework that explicitly models cortical hierarchy to decode fMRI signals into natural images, achieving state-of-the-art semantic reconstruction while maintaining visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based fMRI decoders overlook the brain's hierarchical visual processing by directly conditioning on fMRI features without analyzing cortical organization, which blurs the functional roles of different visual areas.

Method: Hi-DREAM uses an ROI adapter to group fMRI into early/mid/late visual streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth. A depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising.

Result: Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset show Hi-DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful framework for studying visual cortex organization.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VP-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' ability to perceive and utilize visual prompts (like bounding boxes) in image understanding tasks, addressing a gap in current evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack systematic evaluation for interpreting visual prompts (VPs) that humans naturally use when referring to specific image regions, leaving unclear whether models can effectively recognize and use these intuitive prompting methods.

Method: Two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 assesses VP perception in natural scenes using 30k visualized prompts across 8 shapes and 355 attribute combinations; Stage 2 evaluates VP impact on downstream tasks in real-world problem-solving scenarios.

Result: Evaluation of 28 MLLMs (including GPT-4o, InternVL3, Qwen2.5-VL) reveals comprehensive analysis of factors affecting VP understanding, such as VP attribute variations, question arrangement, and model scale.

Conclusion: VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions, providing systematic evaluation of visual prompt interpretation capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

TL;DR: MaMOL is a parameter-efficient framework for incomplete multimodal learning that handles missing modalities through a dual-routing mechanism with dynamic and static routers, achieving robust performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal classification in remote sensing suffers from missing modalities due to environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which degrades performance. Existing methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that treats modality missing as multi-task learning. Uses dual-routing mechanism: task-oriented dynamic router for adaptive expert activation based on missing patterns, and modality-specific-shared static router for stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Achieves parameter efficiency through lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse.

Result: Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks show superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate scalability and cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: MaMOL provides a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning, demonstrating strong performance across domains with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Motivation: Current PD-L1 assessment methods using immunohistochemistry are resource-intensive, creating a need for more efficient alternatives using readily available H&E-stained images.

Method: Built on nnUNet-v2, the framework uses Multimodal Posterior Sampling by sampling diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior distribution, enabling both segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation.

Result: On lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset, achieved mean Dice Score of 0.805 and mean IoU of 0.709, with uncertainty estimates showing strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration needs improvement.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction represents a promising approach for scalable and interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in ultrasound AI including operator dependency, anatomical variations, and limited annotations that hinder generalizable models.

Method: Uses vision Mamba backbone for local/global dependencies, novel self-adaptive masking combining contrastive learning with masked image modeling, and dynamic learning schedule on largest public ultrasound dataset (308K+ images from 42 datasets).

Result: Developed OpenUS foundation model that can serve as backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning on downstream ultrasound tasks.

Conclusion: OpenUS provides a reproducible foundation model for ultrasound AI that addresses key challenges in the field and enables efficient adaptation to various clinical applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

TL;DR: CVChess is a deep learning framework that converts smartphone images of physical chessboards into FEN notation using a CNN with residual layers, enabling integration with online chess engines for move recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between physical and digital chess experiences by providing real-time assistance for physical chess games, similar to what exists for online chess platforms.

Method: The method uses a multi-step process: image preprocessing with Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform for top-down alignment, segmentation into 64 squares, and piece classification using a residual CNN with 13 classes (6 white pieces, 6 black pieces, and empty squares).

Result: The system was trained and evaluated on the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD) containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse conditions, achieving accurate piece classification for FEN generation.

Conclusion: CVChess successfully enables physical chess games to leverage online chess engines by converting board images to FEN notation, making advanced chess analysis accessible for traditional chess play.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE proposes a lightweight fusion module using cross-attention layers near the top of vision and text encoders to align hidden states, outperforming comparable VLMs on retrieval, VQA, and reasoning tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM fusion methods either mix tokens early or compare pooled embeddings late, missing the rich modality-specific structure in hidden states. The authors want to directly align what vision and text encoders "think" through their hidden states.

Method: A few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders project vision and text hidden states into shared space, attend across modalities, and send gated residual updates back with stabilizers. Encoders remain non-causal and generation is decoupled via optional decoder.

Result: BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight fusion module effectively aligns vision and text hidden states, achieving strong performance on multiple VLM tasks while maintaining efficiency and clean decoupling of generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

*Shansi Zhang,Min Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using LLMs to automate military simulation analysis by decomposing tasks, using multi-round interactions with self-checking, custom tools for visualization, and adaptable report templates, achieving higher quality reports than baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual analysis of military simulation data is time-consuming and error-prone, while single-instruction LLM approaches cannot produce well-structured analysis reports needed for effective military decision-making.

Method: Decompose complex analysis tasks into sub-tasks with specialized prompts, use multi-round LLM interactions with self-check and reflection, employ custom tools for figure generation and metric computation, and design adaptable report templates for different scenarios.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows the method generates higher quality reports with better structure and content compared to baseline approaches, as measured by higher evaluation scores.

Conclusion: The proposed structured approach using LLMs with task decomposition, multi-round interactions, and custom tools successfully automates military simulation analysis, producing high-quality, well-formatted reports that outperform traditional methods.

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trade-off between response depth and latency in historical character dialogue systems, where simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses while multi-stage reflection is too slow.

Method: Transform biographical data into enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employ two-stage retrieval with parallel processing for efficient prompt generation.

Result: Achieves 0.52s prompt generation latency and parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), with additional visualization capabilities.

Conclusion: The architecture provides a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency, generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the feasibility of applying quantum computing to large-scale natural language generation tasks, moving beyond simple quantum applications to complex dialogue systems.

Method: Integrated variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework, using 10 qubits with 80 quantum gates to replace about 10% of classical parameters in 150M-parameter models.

Result: Achieved comparable convergence stability and generation quality to classical models while using minimal quantum resources, successfully performing coherent and context-aware dialogue.

Conclusion: This work provides an early demonstration that quantum computing can be effectively integrated into large-scale generative language models, opening possibilities for quantum-enhanced NLP applications.

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

### [110] [Empirical Characterization of Temporal Constraint Processing in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10654)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with temporal constraint processing in real-time decision-making, showing systematic risks including bimodal performance, extreme prompt brittleness, and action bias, with no correlation to parameter count. Fine-tuning provides limited improvement, but current architectures lack necessary mechanisms for reliable temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the assumption that LLMs can reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed when deployed in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints.

Method: Evaluated eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, analyzed performance patterns, tested prompt brittleness, and conducted fine-tuning experiments with 200 synthetic examples.

Result: Revealed systematic risks: bimodal performance distribution (95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes), systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models), and no correlation between parameter count and capability. Fine-tuning improved partially capable models by 12-37 percentage points.

Conclusion: Temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language. Current autoregressive architectures lack necessary mechanisms for continuous temporal state representation, explicit constraint checking, and systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations, making deployment in time-critical applications risky without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning.

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

Method: Three key enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs to augment missing context.

Result: Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise.

Conclusion: The work successfully extends Spectral NSR with modular semantic preprocessing that improves graph quality while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline, resulting in a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

### [112] [Preference Orchestrator: Prompt-Aware Multi-Objective Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10656)
*Biao Liu,Ning Xu,Junming Yang,Xin Geng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRO (PReference Orchestrator) is a novel framework that uses a lightweight preference adapter to automatically infer prompt-specific preference weights for multi-objective LLM alignment, eliminating manual weight specification and improving training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-objective alignment methods require manual preference weight specification, which burdens users and leads to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations.

Method: PRO features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, reflecting effective preference balances across objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of PRO over existing multi-objective alignment approaches, with theoretical analysis proving superior performance compared to fixed preference weights.

Conclusion: PRO successfully addresses the challenge of aligning LLMs with varying human preferences across multiple objectives by automating preference weight inference, improving both usability and training efficiency in multi-objective alignment scenarios.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

*You Zuo,Kim Gerdes,Eric Villemonte de La Clergerie,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A contrastive learning framework for patent embeddings using multiple sections within the same patent document as complementary views, overcoming limitations of dropout-based augmentation and achieving state-of-the-art performance without external annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure mode of SimCSE-style dropout augmentation in patent documents, which produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion, by leveraging the inherent discourse structure of patents.

Method: Proposes section-based augmentation where different patent sections (abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views in contrastive learning, introducing natural semantic and structural diversity to mitigate over-dispersion.

Result: The fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation- and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification on large-scale benchmarks, with different sections specializing for different tasks (claims/summaries for retrieval, background for classification).

Conclusion: Exploiting intra-document views from patent sections provides scalable and generalizable patent understanding, highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning without relying on brittle external annotations.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of open-weight LLMs for extracting structured information from clinical records across multiple tasks, diseases, languages, and institutions, addressing limitations of prior work that focused on single tasks and English-only reports.

Method: Evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs (general-purpose and medical-specialized) on pathology and radiology reports across six medical use cases at three institutes in Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Compared six prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Used task-appropriate metrics with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models.

Result: Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialized models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy.

Conclusion: Open-weight LLMs can effectively extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively extract structured data from complex multi-page government fiscal documents using a multi-stage pipeline with hierarchical validation, achieving high accuracy for converting PDF disclosures into research-ready databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have strong text comprehension but their ability to process complex hierarchical tabular data from government fiscal documents remains underexplored, especially for converting PDF-based disclosures into structured databases.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline leveraging domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation that uses hierarchical relationships in fiscal tables (with totals at each level) for robust internal validation through multi-level validation checks.

Result: Applied to 200+ page annual fiscal documents from Karnataka, India, the method achieves high accuracy in extracting structured data and demonstrates LLMs can process document-specific structural hierarchies.

Conclusion: LLM-based techniques offer a scalable process for converting PDF fiscal documents into research-ready databases, with promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.

*Qihang Zhang,Muchen Li,Ziao Wang,Renjie Liao,Lele Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework using Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE) that combines universal compressors with neural language models at inference time to improve text compression performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of neural compressors in generalizing to unseen data while maintaining the advantages of traditional universal compressors (low computational overhead, high speed, broad applicability).

Method: Test-Time Steering via Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE) that adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model during inference.

Result: The approach ensures compression rate is at least as good as the best individual model and improves text compression performance without requiring fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions and seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model.

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

### [117] [Bayesian Evaluation of Large Language Model Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10661)
*Rachel Longjohn,Shang Wu,Saatvik Kher,Catarina Belém,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to quantify statistical uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics for LLM-based text generation systems, addressing the gap in existing evaluation methods that neglect uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods often use binary scoring on benchmark prompts but fail to account for statistical uncertainty, particularly uncertainty induced by probabilistic text generation strategies used in LLM systems.

Method: The authors develop a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics, focusing on uncertainty from probabilistic text generation. They apply this method to two case studies: refusal rate evaluation on adversarial prompts and pairwise preference comparison between LLMs.

Result: The Bayesian approach successfully provides useful uncertainty quantification about LLM behavior, demonstrating its application in evaluating refusal rates on harmful prompts and comparing LLM preferences in dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework offers valuable statistical uncertainty quantification for LLM evaluation metrics, addressing a critical gap in current evaluation practices and providing more reliable assessment of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of 7 LLMs on Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish across 4 tasks reveals proprietary models lead but struggle with cultural nuances and morphological complexity, while open-source models lag significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well in high-resource languages like English but their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored, requiring systematic evaluation.

Method: Evaluated 7 LLMs on cross-lingual benchmark covering Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish across 4 tasks using both human evaluations (fluency, factual accuracy, cultural appropriateness) and automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE).

Result: Proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude 3.5) lead across languages/tasks but show gaps in cultural understanding and morphological generalization. Open-source models lag substantially in fluency and accuracy. All models struggle with language-specific challenges.

Conclusion: Significant disparities exist between proprietary and open-source models, with persistent challenges in cultural awareness and linguistic generalization, highlighting need for more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework improves semantic robustness of LLM guard models by enforcing prediction consistency across paraphrases using skew-aware aggregation, reducing semantic variability by ~58% and improving calibration by up to 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guard models for LLM safety are vulnerable to superficial linguistic variations, showing large fluctuations in safety scores even for meaning-preserving paraphrases, revealing lack of semantic grounding.

Method: Practical self-supervised framework using paraphrase sets with novel skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation, addressing limitations of standard aggregation methods like mean and median.

Result: Reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, generalizes to unseen stylistic variations, and improves model calibration by up to 40%.

Conclusion: Semantic consistency should be treated as a first-class training objective, revealing a bidirectional relationship between calibration and consistency, providing scalable recipe for more reliable guard models.

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

*Sichao Li,Xinyue Xu,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STaDS framework evaluates LLM understanding through structured decision simulations across multiple domains, revealing that accuracy alone doesn't guarantee genuine understanding or consistent decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses on predictive accuracy, but correctness doesn't necessarily indicate genuine understanding. The authors aim to assess whether LLMs can make consistent, well-founded decisions like human experts across diverse domains.

Method: Introduced Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS) - expert-like decision settings where LLMs undergo structured 'exams'. Evaluates understanding through three components: question/instruction comprehension, knowledge-based prediction, and reliance on relevant decision factors. Tested 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings.

Result: Most models struggle with consistent accuracy across domains. Models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, with frequent mismatches between stated rationales and actual prediction drivers. Accuracy doesn't correlate well with genuine understanding.

Conclusion: Current accuracy-focused evaluation is insufficient. Need global-level understanding evaluation protocols and novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' true understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cochlear implant outcomes in children with severe-to-profound hearing loss show high variability that cannot be reliably predicted by traditional factors like age at implantation or residual hearing, creating a need for better prediction models.

Method: Compared traditional machine learning vs deep transfer learning algorithms using brain neuroanatomic features from 278 implanted children across three centers, employing binary classification of high vs low language improvers with bilinear attention-based fusion strategy.

Result: DTL achieved 92.39% accuracy, 91.22% sensitivity, 93.56% specificity, and AUC of 0.977, significantly outperforming traditional ML models in all outcome measures.

Conclusion: DTL enables direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information through representation learning, supporting the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for global CI program language prediction.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for code-switching speech translation using Large Language Models enhanced with Mixture of Experts speech projectors and a multi-stage training paradigm to address data scarcity and semantic modeling challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching speech translation faces significant challenges due to complex semantic modeling and scarcity of CS data, with previous methods relying on implicit learning and costly manual annotations.

Method: Enhances LLMs with MoE speech projectors where each expert specializes in a specific language's semantic subspace, uses multi-stage training with monolingual ASR/ST data, and employs language-specific loss, intra-group load balancing loss, and transition loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses code-switching speech translation challenges by leveraging specialized experts and multi-stage training with available monolingual data, overcoming data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GVF Finetuning is a novel approach that systematically enhances visual factual consistency in MLLMs by integrating explicit factual signals through data augmentation, instruction tuning, and a specialized loss function, significantly reducing visual hallucinations while maintaining general multimodal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models undermines their reliability by fabricating details inconsistent with image content, and existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement in factual reasoning.

Method: Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning integrates explicit factual signals via three mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation (enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts), Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning (embedding factual cues into explicit instructions), and a Factual Consistency Loss function (penalizing factual inaccuracies).

Result: GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats, while maintaining or slightly improving performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE.

Conclusion: GVF Finetuning effectively mitigates visual hallucinations in MLLMs without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities, demonstrating a systematic approach to enhance visual factual consistency.

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: A framework for continual learning in text-to-SQL that uses human feedback to refine queries and distills knowledge into structured memory, enabling LLMs to improve SQL generation accuracy over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge when generating SQL queries from natural language, requiring a way to capture and reuse human expertise.

Method: Developed a continual learning framework where agents receive natural language feedback to refine queries, distill knowledge into structured memory, and retrieve past experiences for future tasks. Evaluated multiple agent architectures including the Procedural Agent.

Result: Memory-augmented agents, especially the Procedural Agent, achieved significant accuracy gains and error reduction on the BIRD benchmark Dev set by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transforms tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, enabling more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from human feedback.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate SQL queries from natural language questions but struggle with database-specific schemas and tacit domain knowledge. We introduce a framework for continual learning from human feedback in text-to-SQL, where a learning agent receives natural language feedback to refine queries and distills the revealed knowledge for reuse on future tasks. This distilled knowledge is stored in a structured memory, enabling the agent to improve execution accuracy over time. We design and evaluate multiple variations of a learning agent architecture that vary in how they capture and retrieve past experiences. Experiments on the BIRD benchmark Dev set show that memory-augmented agents, particularly the Procedural Agent, achieve significant accuracy gains and error reduction by leveraging human-in-the-loop feedback. Our results highlight the importance of transforming tacit human expertise into reusable knowledge, paving the way for more adaptive, domain-aware text-to-SQL systems that continually learn from a human-in-the-loop.

*Ye Jiang,Taihang Wang,Youzheng Liu,Yimin Wang,Yuhan Xia,Yunfei Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage demonstration selection method (TopK + L2D) that uses semantic similarity and label distribution alignment to improve in-context learning performance for text classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demonstration selection methods for in-context learning focus mainly on semantic similarity but overlook label distribution alignment, which can significantly impact LLM performance.

Method: Proposed TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D) method that uses a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model to generate label distributions and calculate divergence between test inputs and candidate demonstrations.

Result: Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show consistent outperformance over previous demonstration selection strategies.

Conclusion: There's a positive correlation between LLM performance and the accuracy of the underlying small language models used for label distribution estimation.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

### [127] [Pre-Attention Expert Prediction and Prefetching for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10676)
*Shien Zhu,Samuel Bohl,Robin Oester,Gustavo Alonso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes pre-attention expert prediction for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs, using activations before attention blocks with linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate expert prefetching with 15% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expert prediction methods use activations from previous layers, resulting in low accuracy and inability to optimize the first layer, while complex prediction methods introduce high computation overhead.

Method: Utilizes activations before attention blocks in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss for expert prediction, leveraging the ranking-preserving property of some LLM functions.

Result: Achieves 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing ~15% absolute accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Pre-attention expert prediction provides an accurate and lightweight solution for expert prefetching in MoE LLMs, supporting first-layer optimization and significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

*Anupama Sitaraman,Bharathan Balaji,Yuvraj Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpiderGen is an LLM-based workflow that generates Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) process information for estimating environmental impact of consumer products, achieving 62% F1-Score and significantly reducing costs from $25,000+ to under $1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address climate change concerns by building tools to estimate environmental impact of consumer products, as GHG emissions are largely contributed by production, use and disposal of these products.

Method: Integrates traditional LCA taxonomy and methodology with LLM reasoning capabilities to generate procedural information for LCA, evaluated against real-world LCA documents as ground-truth.

Result: SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information with minor errors, achieving 62% F1-Score across 10 sample data points, and outperforms baseline techniques like chain-of-thought and one-shot prompting.

Conclusion: SpiderGen demonstrates potential to significantly reduce human effort and costs for carbon impact estimation, producing LCA information for under $1 in 10 minutes compared to traditional $25,000+ costs over 21-person days.

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how different LLM alignment methods (SFT, DPO, RLHF) affect model vulnerability to prompt attacks, showing that even small prompt modifications significantly impact Attack Success Rates and that existing attack benchmarks alone are insufficient for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different alignment methods affect LLMs' susceptibility to prompt attacks and evaluate the limitations of current attack benchmarks in revealing all possible vulnerabilities.

Method: Selected open-source models with different alignment methods (SFT, DPO, RLHF) and conducted systematic analysis using statistical methods to measure sensitivity of Attack Success Rate (ASR) to prompt variations.

Result: Even small prompt modifications can significantly change ASR according to statistical tests, making models more or less susceptible to different attack types. Existing attack benchmarks alone are insufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The study contributes to model attack evaluation through systematic, statistically-based analyses of alignment methods and their sensitivity to prompt variations, highlighting the need for more comprehensive vulnerability assessment approaches.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

*Jiahang He,Rishi Ramachandran,Neel Ramachandran,Aryan Katakam,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Ashwinee Panda,Aryan Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant robustness vulnerabilities when subjected to simple multi-turn follow-up prompts, with accuracy dropping up to 10% over repeated questioning. Markov chain modeling reveals stationary accuracy is consistently lower than initial accuracy, and linear probes can predict answer changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLM robustness in interactive settings where user-model interactions are increasingly frequent and scale, as consistent reasoning is essential for real-world deployment.

Method: Using simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to test answer changes, modeling accuracy dynamics with Markov chains, and examining whether linear probes can predict answer changes from hidden states.

Result: "Think again" prompt caused ~10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over 9 turns; combined prompt caused 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Stationary accuracy is ~8% lower than first-turn accuracy. Linear probes show evidence of predicting future answer changes.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit significant fragility under repeated questioning, establishing stationary accuracy as a key robustness metric. Addressing this instability is essential for high-stakes interactive applications where consistent reasoning matters.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Arpita Vats,Harshwardhan Fartale,Rahul Raja,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Ishita Prasad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recursive prompting with LLMs for synthetic data generation shows gender bias dynamics reach equilibrium rather than monotonic amplification, with bias levels converging toward the model's inherent bias. Contrastive augmentation effectively reduces downstream bias despite higher embedding-based scores, revealing a paradox in bias evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gender bias dynamics in recursive prompting for synthetic dataset generation and understand how bias amplifies or decays across generations, while evaluating different mitigation strategies.

Method: Used three generations of recursive text generation with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies. Evaluated using three complementary frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance.

Result: Found equilibrium dynamics: low initial bias amplified toward model's inherent bias (+36%), high initial bias decayed toward it (-26%). Contrastive augmentation achieved significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low bias, 91% average) despite higher embedding-based bias scores.

Conclusion: Semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation. Contrastive augmentation is effective for reducing downstream bias despite paradoxical embedding-based scores.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

*Juntu Zhao,Jialing Zhang,Chongxuan Li,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 'telephone game' method to study multimodal systems' hidden language by analyzing their preference bias during image compression and reconstruction, revealing concept connection patterns in their understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the opaque hidden language of closed-source multimodal systems by studying their inherent preference bias that disrupts original concept co-occurrence during image processing.

Method: Uses multi-round 'telephone game' framework where images are compressed to text and reconstructed, observing concept co-occurrence frequency shifts. Introduces Telescope dataset with 10,000+ concept pairs and employs Reasoning-LLMs to analyze unexpected concept relationships.

Result: Enables quantitative investigation of concept connection strength in multimodal systems, construction of global concept connection maps, identification of training bias, assessment of generalization capabilities, and discovery of stable concept pathways.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective on multimodal systems' hidden language and lays foundation for future research on interpretability and controllability of these systems.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

*Zijian Chen,Wenjun Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Squid Game is a dynamic adversarial evaluation environment for LLMs that addresses data contamination issues in static benchmarks by testing models through interactive gameplay under resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks struggle to evaluate LLMs reliably due to potential data contamination from internet training data, and they don't test model behavior under pressure or resource constraints.

Method: Developed Squid Game - an adversarial evaluation environment with six elimination-style levels testing instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents.

Result: Evaluated over 50 LLMs, observed generational performance phase transitions, found evidence of models using speculative shortcuts, and showed dynamic evaluation complements static benchmarks through correlation analysis.

Conclusion: Dynamic adversarial evaluation like Squid Game provides a complementary approach to static benchmarks, revealing model behaviors and potential evaluation contamination that static tests miss.

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI voice systems implicitly learn to speak slower when conveying politeness, replicating human social conventions without explicit programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether text-to-speech AI systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate as an implicit politeness cue, rather than relying on explicit programming.

Method: Tested 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) by prompting them to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions, then measuring the resulting speech duration.

Result: Across both platforms, polite prompts produced significantly slower speech than casual prompts with very large effect sizes. The effect was statistically significant for all AI Studio voices and most OpenAI voices.

Conclusion: AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, demonstrating its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

TL;DR: The paper investigates where instruction following begins in language models by measuring when reading transitions to doing through activation patching experiments on simple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct sub-processes in instruction following and identify the specific point in the layer stack where reading gives way to execution.

Method: Used activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs across three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and their compositions, measuring layer-wise flip rates to identify inflection points.

Result: Found an inflection point (termed 'onset') where interventions that change predictions before this point become ineffective afterward, with consistent onset locations across model sizes and multi-hop compositions.

Conclusion: Provides a replicable method to locate where instruction following begins and compare this location across different tasks and model architectures.

Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location. These results provide a simple, replicable way to locate where instruction following begins and to compare this location across tasks and model sizes.

TL;DR: This paper examines nation-level biases in LLMs using UN Security Council data, develops a bias evaluation framework with three tests, and introduces a debiasing method combining RAG with Reflexion that reduces bias and improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate nation-level biases in LLMs within International Relations, particularly focusing on UNSC permanent members, and address the need for bias assessment alongside performance in IR applications.

Method: Developed a bias evaluation framework using UNSC historical records with three distinct tests, and introduced a debiasing framework combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques.

Result: LLMs show varying nation-level biases (favorable toward western nations, unfavorable toward Russia) that change based on model and evaluation context. Models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias. The debiasing framework effectively reduces bias and improves performance, especially in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

Conclusion: LLM biases are multidimensional and vary across models and tasks. Assessing nation-level bias alongside performance is crucial when applying LLMs in International Relations, and the proposed debiasing framework offers an effective solution.

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

TL;DR: ΠAttention is a periodic sparse Transformer that achieves linear complexity while maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities through ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic π-stride skips, and adaptive fusion gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers face quadratic complexity bottlenecks for long sequences, and existing sparse attention methods like RingAttention have limited receptive fields and lack adaptability.

Method: Factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic π-stride skips, and adaptive fusion gates, providing periodic coverage of distant tokens while maintaining linear complexity.

Result: Achieves O(kL + πlogL) receptive field growth vs O(kL) for RingAttention, reduces perplexity by 8.3% compared to RingAttention, and uses 50% fewer GPUs for same context length while matching dense attention quality.

Conclusion: Periodic sparse attention with adaptive fusion enables efficient long-context modeling with predictable token coverage and linear complexity, outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Conclusion: Faithfulness is essential for reliable medical summarization, and the proposed approach demonstrates potential for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

This work is in line with the ongoing effort to mitigate the data scarcity obstacle for a number of Arabic dialects. We collected, segmented, transcribed and translated 108 TEDx talks following our internally developed annotations guidelines. The collected talks represent 25 hours of speech with code-switching that cover speakers with various accents from over 11 different regions of Tunisia. We make the annotation guidelines and corpus publicly available. This will enable the extension of TEDxTN to new talks as they become available. We also report results for strong baseline systems of Speech Recognition and Speech Translation using multiple pre-trained and fine-tuned end-to-end models. This corpus is the first open source and publicly available speech translation corpus of Code-Switching Tunisian dialect. We believe that this is a valuable resource that can motivate and facilitate further research on the natural language processing of Tunisian Dialect.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

*Abir Harrasse,Florent Draye,Zhijing Jin,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how multilingual LLMs represent different languages internally, finding evidence for pivot language representations where models use nearly identical representations across languages with language-specific decoding in later layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multilingual LLMs perform better in dominant training languages despite processing multiple languages, and to uncover the internal mechanisms of multilingual representation in these models.

Method: Train LLMs on different multilingual data mixtures and analyze internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs, including interventions on language features.

Result: Strong evidence for pivot language representations with language-specific decoding in later layers; attribution analyses show decoding relies on high-frequency language features in final layers that linearly read language identity from early layers; interventions can suppress one language and substitute another.

Conclusion: Understanding the pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs, as models employ shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding pathways influenced by dominant training languages.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

### [143] [Reinforcing Stereotypes of Anger: Emotion AI on African American Vernacular English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10846)
*Rebecca Dorn,Christina Chance,Casandra Rusti,Charles Bickham,Kai-Wei Chang,Fred Morstatter,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emotion recognition models show racial bias by disproportionately labeling African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as angry compared to General American English, with false positive anger rates more than doubling for AAVE texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how emotion AI models perform on African American Vernacular English compared to General American English, addressing concerns about cultural bias in automated emotion detection systems used in high-stakes applications.

Method: Analyzed 2.7 million geo-tagged tweets from Los Angeles, scored AAVE strength using computational dialect features, collected emotion annotations on 875 tweets, used community-informed 'silver' labels from AAVE-fluent African American annotators, and compared model performance across GPT, BERT, and SpanEmo models.

Result: Models showed false positive anger rates more than double on AAVE vs GAE (25% to 60% for SpanEmo), correlated more with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations, and neighborhoods with higher African American populations had higher predicted anger (r=0.27) and lower joy (r=-0.10).

Conclusion: Emotion AI systems reinforce racial stereotypes through biased classification, creating emergent safety issues, highlighting the urgent need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing approaches.

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Task arithmetic for LLM skill transfer suffers from negative interference when models diverge. The paper addresses this by aligning parameter spaces using Transformer symmetries, adapting for GQA and SwiGLU layers, enabling successful reasoning skill transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard task arithmetic for transferring skills between LLMs often fails due to negative interference when models have diverged during training, limiting effective skill sharing across evolving model families.

Method: Align parameter spaces first by leveraging Transformer architecture symmetries (permutation, rotation, scaling), adapt alignment for modern GQA and SwiGLU layers using both weight-based and activation-based approaches.

Result: Successfully transferred advanced reasoning skills to non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show consistent outperformance over standard task arithmetic.

Conclusion: Provides effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability through parameter space alignment.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

### [146] [From Fact to Judgment: Investigating the Impact of Task Framing on LLM Conviction in Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10871)
*Parisa Rabbani,Nimet Beyza Bozdag,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent judgment when tasks shift from direct factual queries to conversational contexts, with some models becoming sycophantic and others overly-critical under minimal dialogue framing and rebuttal pressure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks requiring social or conversational judgment, particularly how their conviction changes when tasks are reframed from direct factual queries to conversational judgment tasks.

Method: Evaluation framework contrasting model performance on direct factual queries vs. assessment of speaker correctness in minimal dialogues, with pressure applied via simple rebuttals to measure conviction maintenance.

Result: Models show significant judgment changes under conversational framing - GPT-4o-mini becomes sycophantic while Llama-8B-Instruct becomes overly-critical, with average 9.24% performance change across all models.

Conclusion: Minimal dialogue context significantly alters LLM judgment, making conversational framing a key factor in LLM-based evaluation, and the framework provides reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Motivation: As LLMs enter higher-stakes applications, there's a crucial need for tools to explain their outputs (summaries, responses, etc.) to ensure transparency and trustworthiness.

Method: The toolkit implements three recent explanation tools using both black-box (perturbations) and white-box (gradients) methods to analyze how user-provided context/prompts influence LLM outputs.

Result: ICX360 provides an open-source framework with quick-start guidance and detailed tutorials covering use cases like retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Conclusion: ICX360 addresses the growing need for LLM explainability by offering accessible tools that help users understand how context and prompts affect model outputs across various applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

### [148] [A Multifaceted Analysis of Negative Bias in Large Language Models through the Lens of Parametric Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10881)
*Jongyoon Song,Sangwon Yu,Sungroh Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias where prompt format influences responses more than semantics. Models tend to generate negative responses when lacking sufficient knowledge, and this bias varies with different prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the detailed factors influencing negative bias in LLMs, particularly the relationship between prompt format and negative responses, as previous research focused mainly on detecting negative attention heads without exploring underlying causes.

Method: Introduced a pipeline to construct evaluation sets categorized by model's parametric knowledge (correct, incorrect, insufficient knowledge). Analyzed negative bias across various prompting scenarios including relevant context, "I don't know" options, and chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: Models exhibit shortcut behavior by generating negative responses when lacking sufficient knowledge. Providing context and "I don't know" options reduces negative bias, while chain-of-thought prompting amplifies it. Bias degree varies with prompt type.

Conclusion: Negative bias in LLMs is influenced by multiple factors including knowledge sufficiency and prompt format, providing critical insights for developing mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Method: Built upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets, normalized all entities using UMLS, augmented with mappings to 62 biomedical vocabularies, and enriched with full ontological paths in up to 11 vocabularies.

Result: Created MedPath - a large-scale, multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that enables training and evaluation of semantic-rich, interpretable EL systems.

Conclusion: MedPath facilitates new research in biomedical NLP by supporting the development of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models through semantic enrichment and ontological path integration.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

*Farima Fatahi Bayat,Pouya Pezeshkpour,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) show improved accuracy but suffer from Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), where they treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, leading to less coherent justifications despite correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether tool-enabled gains in TaLMs reflect trustworthy reasoning, particularly focusing on whether tools are used as substitutes for reasoning rather than as assistive evidence.

Method: Developed PYMATH benchmark with 1,679 competition-level math problems requiring Python code, created multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation, and proposed preference-optimization framework to realign tool usage.

Result: TaLMs achieved up to 19.3% gain in final-answer accuracy but showed reasoning degradation (non-tool LLMs won 41.5% more in reasoning comparisons), with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases and degradation intensifying with tool frequency.

Conclusion: Tool use shifts errors from arithmetic to global reasoning failures, and the proposed optimization framework can improve both accuracy and reasoning depth by realigning tools as assistive evidence rather than reasoning substitutes.

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

TL;DR: EMSQA introduces a specialized medical QA dataset with 24.3K questions across 10 clinical areas and 4 certification levels, plus two methods: Expert-CoT (context-aware chain-of-thought) and ExpertRAG (retrieval-augmented generation) that improve LLM performance in emergency medical services.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack domain-specific medical expertise and structured context like clinical subject areas and certification levels, limiting their effectiveness in high-stakes medical settings.

Method: Created EMSQA dataset with 24.3K questions across 10 clinical areas and 4 certification levels, plus 40K documents. Developed Expert-CoT (context-aware chain-of-thought) and ExpertRAG (retrieval-augmented generation with subject-aligned documents).

Result: Expert-CoT improves accuracy by up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT. Combined Expert-CoT + ExpertRAG yields up to 4.59% gain over standard RAG. 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all EMS certification simulation exams.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific clinical context and certification levels significantly improves LLM performance in medical QA, enabling models to pass professional certification exams.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares various ML models for classifying exam questions using Bloom's Taxonomy, finding that SVM with data augmentation performs best (94% accuracy), while complex deep learning models suffer from overfitting on limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automatically classify educational content according to Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive categories to improve educational assessment and curriculum design.

Method: Used 600 labeled sentences with six cognitive categories; tested traditional ML (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM), RNNs (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformers (BERT, RoBERTa), and LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic) with various preprocessing and augmentation strategies.

Result: SVM with data augmentation achieved best performance (94% accuracy/recall/F1). RNNs and BERT showed severe overfitting. LLMs achieved ~0.72-0.73 accuracy in zero-shot evaluation, with OpenAI and Gemini performing best.

Conclusion: Simple algorithms with careful data augmentation outperform complex deep models on limited data for Bloom's Taxonomy classification, highlighting the importance of appropriate model selection for educational text classification tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

Motivation: Current translation evaluation methods focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency, which is inadequate for expert domains requiring discourse-level coherence and terminological precision in scholarly communication.

Method: Created DiscoX benchmark with 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains (avg. 1700+ tokens) and developed Metric-S, a reference-free evaluation system providing fine-grained assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness.

Result: Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Experiments show advanced LLMs still trail human experts, validating DiscoX's difficulty and highlighting remaining challenges in professional-grade machine translation.

Conclusion: DiscoX and Metric-S provide a robust framework for rigorous evaluation of discourse-level translation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation by addressing current limitations in expert domain translation assessment.

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

*Aladin Djuhera,Farhan Ahmed,Swanand Ravindra Kadhe,Syed Zawad,Heiko Ludwig,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of popular open-source DPO datasets, introduces a new curated mixture called UltraMix that outperforms individual datasets despite being smaller, and releases annotations and metadata for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of systematic comparisons between open-source DPO datasets due to high computational costs and insufficient quality annotations, making it difficult to understand preference selection, task coverage, and human judgment alignment.

Method: Used the Magpie framework to annotate samples for task category, input quality, and preference reward; systematically curated UltraMix by selectively combining samples from five corpora while removing noisy or redundant ones.

Result: UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset but exceeds its performance across key benchmarks, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins across existing datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides the first comprehensive data-centric analysis of DPO corpora, demonstrates the effectiveness of selective dataset curation, and releases resources to advance data-centric preference optimization research.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a consistent bias in text embedding models where all embedding vectors contain an identical component μ. It proposes Renormalization, a training-free method that removes this bias, significantly improving performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias across all sentences, which may degrade their performance on downstream tasks.

Method: Proposes Renormalization - a plug-and-play, training-free solution that subtracts either the bias component μ directly or its projection from embedding vectors. Two variants: direct subtraction or projection subtraction.

Result: Renormalization consistently improves performance across 38 models: 9.7σ improvement on retrieval tasks, 3.1σ on classification tasks, and 0.8σ on other tasks. The projection-based variant performs better as theoretically predicted.

Conclusion: Renormalization effectively removes consistent bias from text embeddings, significantly boosting performance across multiple task types without requiring retraining.

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models sometimes generate factually incorrect information (hallucinations), and this research investigates whether LLMs can identify their own hallucinations.

Method: Formulated hallucination detection as a classification task, proposed a framework to estimate LLM capability, and used Chain-of-Thought prompting to extract knowledge from model parameters.

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo with Chain-of-Thought detected 58.2% of its own hallucinations in experiments.

Conclusion: LLMs with Chain-of-Thought can detect hallucinations when sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Method: Manual annotation of debate transcripts from 2016, 2020, and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical analysis and investigation of fine-tuned transformer models and general-purpose LLMs for detecting personal attacks.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of both fine-tuned transformer models and general-purpose LLMs for detecting personal attacks in formal political speech.

Conclusion: Task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication and improve automated detection of personal attacks in political discourse.

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AV-Dialog is the first multimodal dialogue framework that uses both audio and visual cues to improve speaker tracking, turn-taking prediction, and response generation in noisy multi-speaker environments, outperforming audio-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dialogue models struggle in noisy, multi-speaker environments, producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking due to lack of visual context about speakers.

Method: Combines acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets to enable robust streaming transcription, turn-boundary detection, and response generation.

Result: Outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality.

Conclusion: Visual cues combined with audio significantly improve dialogue agent performance in real-world noisy environments, paving the way for more robust spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoDetector is a novel framework for Meme Emotion Understanding that uses MLLMs to extract implicit meanings and employs dual-stage multimodal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MET-MEME and MOOD datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in meme emotion understanding: lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies and insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge.

Method: Proposes a four-step textual enhancement module using MLLMs to extract implicit insights, followed by dual-stage modal fusion with shallow fusion of raw content and deep integration of enhanced features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 4.3% F1 improvement on MET-MEME and 3.4% on MOOD datasets. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: MemoDetector effectively addresses MEU challenges through enhanced text extraction and hierarchical multimodal fusion, demonstrating strong potential for advancing meme emotion understanding.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of social media and Internet culture, memes have become a popular medium for expressing emotional tendencies. This has sparked growing interest in Meme Emotion Understanding (MEU), which aims to classify the emotional intent behind memes by leveraging their multimodal contents. While existing efforts have achieved promising results, two major challenges remain: (1) a lack of fine-grained multimodal fusion strategies, and (2) insufficient mining of memes' implicit meanings and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MemoDetector, a novel framework for advancing MEU. First, we introduce a four-step textual enhancement module that utilizes the rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to progressively infer and extract implicit and contextual insights from memes. These enhanced texts significantly enrich the original meme contents and provide valuable guidance for downstream classification. Next, we design a dual-stage modal fusion strategy: the first stage performs shallow fusion on raw meme image and text, while the second stage deeply integrates the enhanced visual and textual features. This hierarchical fusion enables the model to better capture nuanced cross-modal emotional cues. Experiments on two datasets, MET-MEME and MOOD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, MemoDetector improves F1 scores by 4.3\% on MET-MEME and 3.4\% on MOOD. Further ablation studies and in-depth analyses validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its strong potential for advancing MEU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle with long-context information in contextualized scenarios requiring domain-specific knowledge due to constrained model context windows and sparse relevant information within extensive contextual noise.

Method: Proposed SAP² framework with two-stage dynamic pruning and integration of relevant contextual keywords using Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism to efficiently compress context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with WER of 7.71% on SlideSpeech and 1.12% on LibriSpeech. On SlideSpeech, reduced biased keyword error rates by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. Method shows robust scalability under extensive contextual input conditions.

Conclusion: SAP² effectively addresses long-context challenges in ASR systems through dynamic keyword pruning and integration, demonstrating superior performance and scalability in contextualized speech recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new supersense typology for adverbs to address WordNet's lack of systematic semantic classification for adverbs, covering categories like manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet has rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs but adverbs remain underdeveloped without systematic semantic classification, creating a gap in linguistic resources and limiting NLP applications.

Method: Developed a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs and empirically validated it through a pilot annotation study to assess coverage and reliability.

Result: The pilot annotation study demonstrated that the proposed categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators.

Conclusion: The new adverb supersense typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications including word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling.

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

*Jader Martins Camboim de Sá,Jooyoung Lee,Cédric Pruski,Marcos Da Silveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANE is an adversarial training method that improves fine-grained word meaning resolution in neural language models by generating challenging negative examples through selective word marking, forcing better separability between sentences with different marked words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural language models often overfit to global sentence representations and fail to capture local semantic details, which limits their ability to resolve fine-grained word meanings.

Method: Proposed LANE adversarial training strategy that generates negative training examples by selectively marking alternate words in the training set, shifting the model's focus to target words and creating greater separability between same sentences with different marked words.

Result: Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks show improved performance over standard contrastive learning baselines, with more discriminative word representations that better capture subtle meaning differences.

Conclusion: LANE is an effective model-agnostic method that can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks to enhance fine-grained word meaning resolution capabilities.

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline for generating natural language QA pairs from knowledge graphs using template clustering and LLM refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for QA generation from knowledge graphs struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency.

Method: Clusters KG triplets by relations, creates reusable templates via natural language rules, refines templates with LLMs for clarity, and instantiates answer options with KG-based distractors.

Result: The hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs that combine scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses scalability and quality issues in QA generation from knowledge graphs through a deterministic approach enhanced by LLM refinement.

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD is a token-efficient multi-agent debate framework that selectively triggers debates only when needed, reducing computational costs by up to 92% while improving accuracy by up to 13.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) systems are inefficient as they trigger debates for every query, incurring high computational costs and potentially degrading accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers.

Method: iMAD learns to make intelligent debate decisions by prompting a single agent to produce structured self-critique responses, extracting 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues, and using a lightweight classifier with FocusCal loss to determine when to trigger MAD.

Result: Extensive experiments on six (visual) question answering datasets show iMAD significantly reduces token usage by up to 92% while improving final answer accuracy by up to 13.5% compared to five competitive baselines.

Conclusion: iMAD provides an effective and efficient framework for multi-agent debate systems by intelligently triggering debates only when beneficial, achieving both computational savings and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have advanced financial NLP but their high computational demands limit accessibility for many organizations, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET) analyzes hidden state representations to identify and selectively fine-tune the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs while freezing less critical layers.

Result: LAET outperforms existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 on financial NLP tasks, even with smaller models (~3B parameters), while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research with real-world deployment by providing efficient and scalable models for financial applications through the LAET approach.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: Digitized histopathology analysis involves complex, time-intensive workflows and specialized expertise, limiting its accessibility. We introduce NOVA, an agentic framework that translates scientific queries into executable analysis pipelines by iteratively generating and running Python code. NOVA integrates 49 domain-specific tools (e.g., nuclei segmentation, whole-slide encoding) built on open-source software, and can also create new tools ad hoc. To evaluate such systems, we present SlideQuest, a 90-question benchmark -- verified by pathologists and biomedical scientists -- spanning data processing, quantitative analysis, and hypothesis testing. Unlike prior biomedical benchmarks focused on knowledge recall or diagnostic QA, SlideQuest demands multi-step reasoning, iterative coding, and computational problem solving. Quantitative evaluation shows NOVA outperforms coding-agent baselines, and a pathologist-verified case study links morphology to prognostically relevant PAM50 subtypes, demonstrating its scalable discovery potential.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has not been matched by their evaluation in low-resource languages, especially Southeast Asian languages like Lao. To fill this gap, we introduce LaoBench, the first large-scale, high-quality, and multidimensional benchmark dataset dedicated to assessing LLMs' comprehensive language understanding and reasoning abilities in Lao. LaoBench comprises over 17,000 carefully curated samples spanning three core dimensions: knowledge application, K12 foundational education, and bilingual translation among Lao, Chinese, and English. The dataset is divided into open-source and closed-source subsets, with the closed-source portion enabling black-box evaluation on an official platform to ensure fairness and data security. Our data construction pipeline integrates expert human curation with automated agent-assisted verification, ensuring linguistic accuracy, cultural relevance, and educational value. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on LaoBench reveals that current models still face significant challenges in mastering Lao across diverse tasks. We hope LaoBench will catalyze further research and development of AI technologies for underrepresented Southeast Asian languages.

*Jeffrey S. Bowers,Jeff Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models learn attested and impossible languages equally well when complexity is controlled, unlike humans who find impossible languages harder due to innate inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether language models share human-like inductive biases that make natural languages easier to learn than impossible languages, as suggested by previous research.

Method: Review and analysis of existing literature comparing language model learning performance on attested vs. impossible languages, controlling for complexity factors.

Result: Language models often learn attested and impossible languages equally well when complexity is accounted for. The supposedly 'impossible' languages that are difficult to learn are simply more complex or random.

Conclusion: Language models lack the specific human inductive biases that support natural language acquisition, explaining why they don't show the same preference for attested over impossible languages that humans do.

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics without requiring explicit user prompts, enabling automatic identification and separation of conversation partners in multi-speaker environments.

Method: Dual-model architecture: lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5ms for low-latency extraction, and slower model captures longer-range conversational dynamics. Uses egocentric binaural audio with self-speech as anchor and turn-taking behavior.

Result: Successfully generalized to identify and isolate conversational partners in real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours of data collected with binaural egocentric hardware.

Conclusion: This work represents a step toward proactive hearing assistants that automatically adapt to conversational dynamics and engagement, enabling real-time, on-device operation without explicit user input.

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: W2S-AlignTree is a plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search with Weak-to-Strong Generalization to align LLM outputs with human preferences without parameter modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods like RLHF face high costs and scalability limitations, with limited dynamic control during inference. There's a need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms that provide fine-grained control.

Method: Formulates LLM alignment as optimal heuristic search using MCTS with Weak-to-Strong paradigm. Uses weak model's step-level signals as alignment proxies and introduces Entropy-Aware exploration to balance exploration-exploitation in generation search trees.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following tasks. Notably improves Llama3-8B performance from 1.89 to 2.19 (15.9% relative improvement) on summarization.

Conclusion: W2S-AlignTree provides an effective inference-time alignment solution that enables fine-grained guidance without modifying model parameters, addressing scalability and adaptability limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing academic benchmarks offer limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts, particularly in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance where practical returns are paramount. Current evaluations fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks.

Method: Created PRBench with 1,100 tasks authored by 182 qualified professionals (JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years experience) inspired by actual workflows. Tasks span 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Implemented rigorous quality pipeline with independent expert validation for 19,356 expert-curated rubrics.

Result: Evaluation of 20 leading models shows poor performance with top scores of 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on Hard subsets. Models with similar overall scores diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, lack of process transparency, and incomplete reasoning.

Conclusion: Substantial gaps exist in AI models' reliability for professional adoption in Legal and Finance domains. The benchmark reveals critical limitations in reasoning capabilities and highlights the need for improved model performance on realistic, economically consequential professional tasks.

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Second Law of AI analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy (divergence from intended goals) increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. It provides mathematical proofs and simulations showing that alignment work must exceed a critical threshold to maintain stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a quantitative framework for AI alignment by drawing analogies to thermodynamics, addressing the spontaneous drift of AI systems away from intended goals without continuous intervention.

Method: Defined ethical entropy S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta) over goals {g_i}, proved dS/dt ≥ 0 due to exploration noise and specification gaming, derived critical alignment work threshold gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, and validated with simulations on 7-billion-parameter models.

Result: Simulations show unconstrained 7B-parameter model (lambda_max=1.2) drifts from entropy 0.32 to 1.69±1.08 nats, while regularized system with gamma=20.4 (1.5×gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00±0.00 nats (p=4.19×10^-17).

Conclusion: AI alignment should be treated as continuous thermodynamic control problem, with quantitative foundation for maintaining stability and safety of autonomous systems through sufficient alignment work.

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-EPG is a self-iterative training framework that enables co-evolution of planning and grounding capabilities for GUI task automation through an iterative positive feedback loop, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUI automation methods suffer from insufficient cross-model synergies and over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Co-EPG establishes an iterative feedback loop where the planning model explores strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via GRPO, generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model, which in turn provides better rewards for subsequent planning model training.

Result: On Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, Co-EPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data, with consistent improvement in each iteration.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents that shifts from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

TL;DR: The paper reframes Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, conducts axiomatic analysis of quality measures, introduces a new measure called directed coverage, analyzes computational complexity, and shows experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce cognitive load on decision makers in multi-objective optimization by selecting representative subsets of Pareto optimal solutions, and to address unintuitive behaviors in existing quality measures.

Method: Reframing Pareto pruning as multiwinner voting, axiomatic analysis of quality measures, introducing directed coverage measure, computational complexity analysis, and experimental evaluation.

Result: Uncovered unintuitive behaviors in existing measures, identified tractability boundaries, and showed that choice of quality measure significantly impacts solution characteristics with their proposed measure performing competitively.

Conclusion: The choice of quality measure is crucial in Pareto pruning, and the proposed directed coverage measure performs well across various settings while computational complexity depends on objective structure.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

TL;DR: The paper presents novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width, establishing efficient encodings for dense graphs where treewidth-based approaches fail.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand encoding capabilities with clique-width for computational problems, particularly in abstract argumentation, since clique-width can be small for dense graphs unlike treewidth, and little is known about encodings despite available algorithms.

Method: Design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT that linearly preserve clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions.

Result: Established novel results for all argumentation semantics including counting, showing that the overhead caused by DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully initiates the study of encoding capabilities with clique-width through abstract argumentation, providing efficient reductions that preserve clique-width and establishing fundamental limitations on their improvement.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop improved counterfactual decision-making rules that go beyond traditional expected outcome comparisons by considering the probabilities of outcome rankings and achieving optimal outcomes for individuals.

Method: Established identification theorems and derived bounds for PoR and PoB metrics, developed estimation methods, and performed numerical experiments to validate finite-sample properties.

Result: Successfully developed and validated estimation methods for the proposed PoR and PoB metrics through numerical experiments and demonstrated their application on real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed PoR and PoB metrics provide valuable new tools for counterfactual decision-making that complement traditional approaches by focusing on outcome ranking probabilities and likelihood of achieving optimal outcomes.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

### [184] [From Efficiency to Adaptivity: A Deeper Look at Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10788)
*Chao Wu,Baoheng Li,Mingchen Gao,Zhenyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey reframes reasoning in LLMs through adaptivity - the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics like difficulty and uncertainty, addressing the limitation of uniform reasoning strategies across different task complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey aims to address this fundamental challenge by focusing on adaptive reasoning.

Method: The survey formalizes deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning in LLMs, defines adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem, and proposes a taxonomy organizing methods into training-based approaches (reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, learned controllers) and training-free approaches (prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, modular composition).

Result: The framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies, connecting classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations in LLMs.

Conclusion: The survey identifies open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control, providing a comprehensive foundation for future research on adaptive reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embedding methods have critical limitations: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. A unified approach is needed to handle diverse relationship types at scale.

Method: Proposes a hybrid framework with relation-specific space weighting that dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, using learned attention mechanisms and multi-space consistency loss to ensure coherent predictions across spaces.

Result: Achieves 0.612 MRR on 10M-paper dataset (4.8% relative gain over best baseline), with efficient training and 85 ms inference per triple. Scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx demonstrates consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across various dataset sizes, providing an effective solution for scalable knowledge graph embeddings that adaptively leverages multiple geometric spaces.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional traffic collision reconstruction relying on human expertise often yields inconsistent results when dealing with incomplete multimodal data, creating a need for more reliable automated systems.

Method: Two-phase collaborative framework: Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs; Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder data.

Result: Achieved perfect accuracy across all 39 complex test cases, successfully identifying relevant EDR events and distinguishing striking vs struck vehicles, surpassing human researchers' 92% accuracy. Maintained robust performance with incomplete data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional planning units like census tracts lack flexibility for effective hazard prevention and don't capture specific local community demands.

Method: Built on RepSC-SOM (representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map) with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, using AI agents to guide feature selection, spatial constraints, and interactive exploration.

Result: Demonstrated through a flooding risk case study in Jacksonville, Florida, showing interactive regionalization that combines computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Conclusion: The system enables creation of dynamic planning units for disaster planning with transparency and adaptability through human-in-the-loop AI guidance.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance learning of Alzheimer's disease progression from longitudinal data, improving prediction accuracy and interpretability by incorporating multi-modal brain connectivity and biological constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods oversimplify brain connectivity by assuming single-modality connectomes, leading to inaccurate pathology spread predictions. Data-driven approaches face identifiability issues due to lack of proper constraints.

Method: Uses LLMs as expert guides on regional variable interactions to simultaneously optimize: 1) long-term disease trajectory construction from irregular longitudinal data, and 2) biologically-constrained graph structure capturing brain region interactions with better identifiability.

Result: Demonstrated superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches using tau-PET imaging data from Alzheimer's disease cohort. Revealed additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Conclusion: The LLM-enhanced framework provides a more accurate and interpretable approach for modeling neurodegenerative disease progression by leveraging multi-modal relationships and biological constraints, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent legal verifier system for AI data transfer compliance under Japanese APPI regulations achieves 72% accuracy, significantly outperforming single-agent baselines through specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is critical under stringent privacy regulations like Japan's APPI, requiring automated systems that can reliably verify compliance while being interpretable and trustworthy.

Method: Multi-agent system that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents (statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, risk assessment) coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol.

Result: Achieved 72% accuracy on 200 APPI Article 16 cases (21% higher than single-agent baseline), with 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% baseline) and perfect detection of clear violations.

Conclusion: Domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy automated compliance verification, though challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

*Steven J. Jones,Robert E. Wray,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses how autonomous AI systems can evaluate and justify multiple courses of action in novel scenarios where no single option fully satisfies all operational constraints, requiring integration of normative, pragmatic, and situational knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous AI systems inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (procedures, rules, laws, norms, goals), requiring them to go beyond trained policies to construct, evaluate, and justify candidate actions in alignment with human values.

Method: The paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in under-specified contexts and identifies types of knowledge needed for robust decision making, drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies.

Result: The research examines how agents need to integrate normative (rules/laws), pragmatic (practical considerations), and situational (context-specific) understanding to select and pursue more aligned courses of action in complex real-world environments.

Conclusion: For autonomous AI systems to achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, they must possess contextual knowledge beyond their trained policies and be capable of integrating multiple knowledge types to construct, evaluate, and justify courses of action in novel scenarios.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of e-commerce platforms creates vast unstructured product data that poses challenges for information retrieval and analytics, while manual construction of product knowledge graphs remains complex and time-consuming.

Method: A three-stage agent-based framework using LLMs: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population, operating without predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules.

Result: Evaluation on air conditioner product descriptions shows strong performance with over 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy, demonstrating semantic coherence and scalability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully automates structured knowledge extraction for retail applications, providing a scalable solution for intelligent product data integration and utilization using LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [192] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new incomplete method for breaking symmetries of abstract structures in constraint programming by exploiting their representations, specifically for indistinguishable objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symmetry-breaking techniques for abstract variables produce complex constraints that perform poorly, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Exploits representations of abstract structures to break symmetries, focusing on indistinguishable objects as a common symmetry type.

Result: The proposed method is faster than previous approaches from Akgün et al. 2025.

Conclusion: The new incomplete symmetry-breaking method provides improved performance for abstract structures in constraint programming.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The critical aspect of role allocation strategies in Multi-Agent Debate remains underexplored despite its potential to enhance reasoning abilities in LLM agents.

Method: Proposed 'Truth Last' role allocation strategy and Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy that uses path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles and simulates the role with highest consistency score as truth.

Result: Truth Last strategy improves MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance across 9 LLM models including DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks.

Conclusion: MADC provides a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling by systematically optimizing Multi-Agent Debate mechanisms and addressing the issue of unknown truth in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSS (Differentiable Simulation for Search) is a planning framework that uses Waymax's differentiable simulator as both next-state predictor and critic, enabling gradient-based optimization of action sequences for improved autonomous driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planning is crucial for safe autonomous driving to avoid collisions in complex traffic, but learning all components (policy, predictor, critic) simultaneously is challenging.

Method: Uses differentiable simulator Waymax for accurate state predictions and gradient-based search across action sequences, combining planning gradients with stochastic search.

Result: DSS significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: The combination of planning gradients and stochastic search through differentiable simulation provides superior performance for autonomous driving planning tasks.

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to ARC rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. The goal is to capture the iterative transformation process humans use to solve complex visual reasoning tasks.

Method: Collected via O2ARC web interface with 10,000 trajectories across 400 training tasks, recording temporally ordered object-level actions. Defines a unified reasoning pipeline with data collection, action abstraction, MDP formulation, and integration with various learning methods including RL, generative modeling, and sequence modeling.

Result: Provides structured trajectories with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels. Enables analysis of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence patterns in human reasoning.

Conclusion: ARCTraj serves as a structured foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence by revealing the intermediate steps in complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple method for generalised planning that learns first-order Condition→Actions rules from optimal plans of training problems, which can be executed directly or used to prune planning search space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective method for synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems (generalised planning) with proven guarantees and improved performance over existing approaches.

Method: For each training problem, compute optimal plans for goal atoms in order, perform goal regression on resulting plans, and lift outputs to obtain first-order Condition→Actions rules that form a generalised plan.

Result: The method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art planners in synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality across classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully learns valid generalised plans and pruning axioms with formal guarantees, demonstrating practical effectiveness across various planning domains.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

TL;DR: GGBench is a new benchmark for evaluating geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models, addressing the gap in current evaluation methods that separately assess discriminative understanding and image generation rather than integrated cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning in UMMs, as they primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately. Geometric construction provides an ideal testbed since it inherently requires fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation.

Method: The authors propose GGBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to understand, reason, and actively construct solutions through geometric tasks.

Result: The benchmark establishes a more rigorous standard for evaluating the next generation of intelligent systems by focusing on the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning rather than separate assessment of understanding and generation capabilities.

Conclusion: GGBench bridges the critical evaluation gap in UMM assessment by providing a specialized benchmark for geometric generative reasoning, setting higher standards for measuring the active, cross-modal generation capabilities that represent the paradigm shift in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Motivation: Address limitations of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) which assumes all agents are rational, when in reality agents themselves can suffer from hallucinations, making consensus unreliable.

Method: Introduces Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol inspired by social deduction games, using multimodal counterfactual tests where reference images are modified to introduce counterfactual evidence, allowing detection of hallucinating agents.

Result: Provides ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enables robust crowd-powered multimodal reasoning through three key advancements: factual verification via counterfactual testing, cross-evidence reasoning with dynamic evidence sources, and active reasoning through probing discussions.

Conclusion: MUG offers a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs by moving beyond statistical consensus to enable factual verification and active reasoning.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

### [199] [STaR: Towards Cognitive Table Reasoning via Slow-Thinking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11233)
*Huajian Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Yucong Luo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR is a framework that enhances table reasoning in LLMs by incorporating slow-thinking capabilities through step-by-step reasoning and uncertainty-aware inference, using difficulty-aware reinforcement learning for training and trajectory-level uncertainty quantification for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table reasoning with LLMs lacks depth and iterative refinement like human cognition, and suffers from instability that compromises reliability in applications.

Method: Uses two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL) to progressively learn from simple to complex queries, and performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency during inference.

Result: Achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability on benchmarks, with strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: STaR demonstrates potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

*Julius Wenzel,Syeda Umaima Alam,Andreas Schmidt,Hanwei Zhang,Holger Hermanns*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a workflow for generating tamper-proof, verifiable traces of AI decisions to address the lack of documentation in automated systems, using confidential computing technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the substantial risk of AI systems causing harm by infringing human rights due to lack of proper documentation and traceability in decision processes, which is essential for legal accountability.

Method: The method involves enforcing documentation of every component in AI training and inference, expanding the DBOM concept into a workflow using confidential computing technology to create tamper-proof and verifiable traces.

Result: The paper demonstrates a working workflow that generates exhaustive traces of AI decisions, implemented in a mushroom classification app as an example of high-stake decision support.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for AI accountability by ensuring comprehensive documentation that can stand up in legal proceedings, addressing the critical need for traceability in automated decision systems.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

*Patrick Koopmann,Yasir Mahmood,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo,Balram Tiwari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces contrastive ABox explanations to answer why an individual 'a' is an instance of concept C while 'b' is not, focusing on relevant commonalities and differences between them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches explain positive entailments and missing entailments separately, but contrastive explanations consider both simultaneously to provide more focused insights into why certain individuals belong to concepts while others don't.

Method: Developed a formal notion of contrastive explanations for ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, analyzed computational complexity for different variants under optimality criteria across various description logics, and implemented a method for computing one variant.

Result: The paper provides computational complexity analysis for different variants of contrastive explanations and presents an implementation that was evaluated on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Conclusion: Contrastive ABox explanations offer a novel approach to simultaneously explain both positive and negative entailments, focusing on relevant differences between individuals, with practical implementation and evaluation demonstrating feasibility.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

*Ruoxi Cheng,Haoxuan Ma,Teng Ma,Hongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign is an inference-time framework that treats LVLM alignment as an economic efficiency problem, using forward-looking evaluation of safety, utility, and cost to prevent jailbreak attacks while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM alignment methods face trade-offs between safety, utility, and operational costs, with process-blindness wasting computational budget on unsafe deliberation and allowing harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications.

Method: EcoAlign reframes alignment as economically rational search by treating LVLM as boundedly rational agent. It incrementally expands thought graphs and scores actions using forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against remaining budget, with path safety enforced via weakest-link principle.

Result: Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: EcoAlign offers a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment by addressing the fundamental economic efficiency problem in alignment rather than treating it as purely a safety challenge.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLSLM is a hybrid reinforcement learning framework that combines rule-based social locomotion models with RL to enable socially-aware navigation by optimizing both mechanical energy and social comfort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable but inflexible rule-based approaches and powerful but opaque data-driven methods for social navigation, creating agents that can navigate human-populated environments without causing discomfort.

Method: Integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model (grounded in empirical behavioral experiments) into RL reward function, generating orientation-sensitive social comfort fields that quantify human comfort across space.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience through human-agent interaction experiments in immersive VR, with significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation, enabling socially aligned policies with minimal training.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent reasoning systems struggle with open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities, limiting their generalization potential despite promising iterative refinement approaches.

Method: Proposed MarsRL framework with agent-specific reward mechanisms to reduce reward noise and pipeline-inspired training for efficient handling of long trajectories, jointly optimizing all agents in the system.

Result: Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improved AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing the larger Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 model.

Conclusion: MarsRL demonstrates significant potential to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks, particularly for open-source models.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: This survey reviews robust and efficient communication strategies for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under realistic constraints like message perturbations, delays, and bandwidth limitations, focusing on applications in autonomous driving, distributed SLAM, and federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MARL approaches assume ideal communication conditions (instantaneous, reliable, unlimited bandwidth) that don't exist in real-world deployments, creating a gap between theoretical models and practical implementations.

Method: Systematic review of recent advances in communication strategies for MARL, analyzing approaches that address realistic constraints including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth.

Result: The survey identifies key challenges in practical MARL systems including low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs, and examines how these are addressed in three application domains.

Conclusion: A unified approach co-designing communication, learning, and robustness is needed to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations, with several open challenges remaining for future research.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

TL;DR: CURENet is a multimodal model that integrates clinical notes, lab tests, and time-series EHR data using LLMs and transformers to predict chronic diseases with over 94% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most predictive models fail to capture interactions and temporal patterns across multiple EHR data modalities, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive patient health views needed for clinical decision-making.

Method: Uses large language models for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, and transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visit data to integrate multimodal EHR information.

Result: Achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting top 10 chronic conditions on MIMIC-III and FEMH datasets in a multi-label framework.

Conclusion: Multimodal EHR integration through CURENet demonstrates significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes by better capturing complex data interactions.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EGuR is an AI system that dynamically generates tailored computational strategies at inference time using accumulated experience, enabling flexible adaptation of LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic without requiring offline optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI systems either only modify textual inputs or require static offline optimization, lacking the ability to dynamically adapt all strategy components (prompts, parameters, tools, logic) based on real-time experience.

Method: EGuR uses an LLM-based meta-strategy with two components: a Guide that generates candidate strategies based on current problems and past experiences, and a Consolidator that integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation.

Result: Across five benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieved up to 14% accuracy improvements over strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Conclusion: EGuR demonstrates that dynamically generated, experience-guided strategies enable significant performance improvements and computational efficiency gains, showing the value of flexible, real-time adaptation in AI systems.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

*Dena Mujtaba,Brian Hu,Anthony Hoogs,Arslan Basharat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A test-time alignment technique using model-guided policy shaping to control AI agent behavior without retraining, enabling ethical alignment while maintaining performance across diverse RL environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents trained to maximize objectives may adopt harmful behaviors, creating a trade-off between reward maximization and ethical alignment. Retraining pre-trained agents is costly, especially with diverse ethical attributes.

Method: Model-guided policy shaping applied at test time using scenario-action attribute classifiers to align decisions with ethical attributes, evaluated on the MACHIAVELLI benchmark with 134 text-based games.

Result: Effective mitigation of unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes without requiring agent retraining, outperforming prior training-time methods.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping provides a scalable solution for maintaining ethical alignment in pre-trained AI agents while balancing performance objectives.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.
