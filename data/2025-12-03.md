### [1] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe selectively applies super-resolution only to undersampled regions lacking high-frequency information, using camera pose relative to scene geometry to guide SR application, resulting in sharper and more consistent 3DGS renders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard super-resolution applied uniformly to all images in 3D Gaussian Splatting introduces multi-view inconsistencies and blurry renders. Existing methods fail to leverage that close-up views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in distant views.

Method: SplatSuRe uses camera pose relative to scene geometry to identify undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, then selectively applies super-resolution only to these areas rather than uniformly across all images.

Result: The approach surpasses baselines in fidelity and perceptual quality across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets, with most significant gains in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

Conclusion: Selective super-resolution based on camera-geometry relationships outperforms uniform SR application for 3DGS, enabling sharper and more consistent high-resolution novel view synthesis by focusing enhancement only where needed.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [2] [Attention-guided reference point shifting for Gaussian-mixture-based partial point set registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02496)
*Mizuki Kikkawa,Tatsuya Yatagawa,Yutaka Ohtake,Hiromasa Suzuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of deep-learning-based point set registration methods using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for partial-to-partial registration, particularly DeepGMR. It introduces an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer to find common reference points and achieve transformation-invariant features, improving performance of DeepGMR and UGMMReg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study investigates problems with deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs for partial-to-partial point set registration, focusing on limitations of DeepGMR. The goal is to uncover causes behind these methods' limitations and propose a comprehensible solution.

Method: The paper introduces an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer that robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets using a well-studied attention module. This layer acquires transformation-invariant features without focusing on overlap regions.

Result: The ARPS layer significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant UGMMReg. These extension models outperform prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract overlap regions or common reference points.

Conclusion: The findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs. The ARPS approach effectively addresses limitations in partial-to-partial point set registration by finding common reference points rather than overlap regions.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

### [3] [Leveraging AI multimodal geospatial foundation models for improved near-real-time flood mapping at a global scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02055)
*Mirela G. Tulbure,Julio Caineta,Mark Broich,Mollie D. Gaines,Philippe Rufin,Leon-Friedrich Thomas,Hamed Alemohammad,Jan Hemmerling,Patrick Hostert*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning ESA-IBM's TerraMind GFM on multimodal FloodsNet dataset improves flood mapping accuracy and recall compared to Sen1Floods11-trained models, with base-unfrozen configuration offering best balance of performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floods are major weather hazards, especially in record-warm 2024. While EO satellites provide critical flood mapping coverage, operational accuracy depends on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent GFMs like TerraMind offer improved generalizability but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.

Method: Fine-tuned TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset with co-located Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 global flood events. Tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both datasets.

Result: Base-unfrozen configuration provided best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at lower computational cost. Large unfrozen model achieved highest recall. FloodsNet-trained models outperformed Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations but with slightly lower accuracy and precision.

Conclusion: Integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning GFMs can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [4] [Content-Aware Texturing for Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02621)
*Panagiotis Papantonakis,Georgios Kopanas,Fredo Durand,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture-mapped Gaussian Splatting that adaptively adjusts texture resolution to represent appearance details more efficiently than using many small Gaussian primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods waste resources by representing fine appearance details as numerous small Gaussian primitives, especially when geometry and appearance have different frequency characteristics. Texture mapping offers a more efficient alternative for detailed appearance representation.

Method: Proposes per-primitive texture maps for 2D Gaussian primitives with adaptive texture resolution optimization. Texture texel size is bounded by image sampling frequency and adapts to input image content through upscaling/downscaling during optimization. Also enables control of primitive count based on texture resolution.

Result: The approach performs favorably in image quality and total parameter count compared to alternative textured Gaussian primitive solutions, achieving more efficient representation of appearance details.

Conclusion: Texture mapping can be effectively integrated into Gaussian Splatting optimization to represent detailed appearance more efficiently than using many small Gaussian primitives, with adaptive texture resolution control and primitive count management.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

### [5] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function with two convergence targets to address information distortion in contrastive learning while improving effectiveness and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning can introduce information distortion from augmented samples, causing models to overrely on samples with identical labels while neglecting positive pairs from the same original image, especially in large datasets.

Method: A context-enriched contrastive loss function with two components: 1) label-sensitive component that differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes, and 2) component that draws closer augmented samples from the same source image while distancing all other samples.

Result: Achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods on 8 benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, CelebA) in both generalization performance and convergence speed. Shows 22.9% improvement on BiasedMNIST dataset compared to original contrastive loss functions.

Conclusion: The proposed technique effectively addresses systematic distortion in contrastive learning and shows promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training, particularly in handling biased datasets.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [6] [LumiX: Structured and Coherent Text-to-Intrinsic Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02781)
*Xu Han,Biao Zhang,Xiangjun Tang,Xianzhi Li,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiX is a structured diffusion framework that jointly generates multiple intrinsic scene properties (albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, color) from text prompts with physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image generation lacks structured, physically consistent intrinsic scene representations. There's a need for coherent generation of multiple intrinsic properties that maintain structural relationships for downstream applications.

Method: Uses Query-Broadcast Attention to share queries across all intrinsic maps for structural consistency, and Tensor LoRA for parameter-efficient modeling of cross-map relations, enabling stable joint diffusion training.

Result: Achieves 23% higher alignment and better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to state-of-the-art methods, and can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

Conclusion: LumiX successfully enables coherent text-to-intrinsic generation with physical consistency through structured diffusion and efficient cross-map modeling, advancing scene understanding and generation capabilities.

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

### [7] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical evaluation framework for jointly assessing text-to-image (T2I) models and vision-language models (VLMs) by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in images generated from challenging prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts (like correct object counts and colors), while VLM benchmarks haven't kept pace with the complexity of scenes they need to annotate. There's a need for better evaluation frameworks to assess prompt adherence and model reliability.

Method: The authors propose a structured methodology that: 1) Tests whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in images generated by T2I models from challenging prompts, 2) Creates a dataset with prompts and images from 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large), 3) Uses VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) to annotate images, with LLM (Llama3) verification to test if VLMs correctly identify failure modes.

Result: Analysis reveals systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation in T2I models. The findings show current metrics are insufficient to capture nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical evaluation framework and dataset provide a structured approach to jointly evaluate T2I models and VLMs, revealing systematic failure modes that current metrics miss. This work emphasizes the need for targeted benchmarks to improve generative model reliability and interpretability.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [8] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLOST: A deep latent variable model that predicts somatic mutation profiles from medical images using dual variational autoencoders coupled by a shared latent space with conditional normalizing flow priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early cancer diagnosis and treatment are crucial for efficacy. Medical imaging is the initial diagnostic tool, while genetic information guides treatment selection. The paper aims to bridge these domains by predicting somatic mutations from medical images to enable earlier genetic insights.

Method: 1) Convert lesion images to point cloud representations for modality invariance; 2) Propose LLOST with dual variational autoencoders for lesion point clouds and somatic mutation counts; 3) Couple them via a shared latent space; 4) Use conditional normalizing flow priors for each of the three latent spaces to handle diverse domain distributions.

Result: Tested on TCIA medical images and Pan Cancer somatic mutations. Showed predictive performance for mutation counts and occurrence prediction. Identified shared patterns between imaging and somatic mutation domains that reflect cancer types.

Conclusion: The model successfully links imaging and genetic domains. Future improvements could enhance the model and incorporate other genetic domains beyond somatic mutations.

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [9] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSurg improves surgical scene segmentation generalization across centers and modalities by exploiting style/content information with instance normalization, feature covariance mapping, and a restitution module, achieving 10-32% IoU improvements over SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical scene segmentation methods fail to generalize to unseen distributions (different centers) and modalities, while natural scene domain adaptation methods don't work well for surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and extreme diversity.

Method: Uses instance normalization and feature covariance mapping to minimize appearance variations, plus a restitution module within ResNet backbone to retain task-relevant features. Also provides new multiclass/multicenter dataset.

Result: RobustSurg achieved ~23% improvement over baseline DeepLabv3+ and 10-32% improvement over SOTA on unseen HeiCholSeg dataset. Also achieved ~22% improvement over baseline and ~11% improvement over SOTA on EndoUDA polyp dataset.

Conclusion: Exploiting style/content information with instance normalization, covariance mapping, and restitution modules enables robust surgical scene segmentation that generalizes across centers and modalities, addressing key challenges in surgical AI.

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [10] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces multifractal recalibration methods for deep learning, showing they outperform other channel-attention mechanisms in medical image segmentation tasks using U-Net architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multifractal analysis has been underutilized in deep learning despite its proven ability to capture regularities in self-seeding phenomena. Existing methods rely on heavy pooling or feature-space decimation that constrain tasks like semantic segmentation.

Method: Introduces two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These leverage relationships between probability mass of exponents and multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks within a U-Net framework.

Result: Multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over baselines with other channel-attention mechanisms using higher-order statistics. Validated on three medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).

Conclusion: Multifractal recalibration is effective for medical image segmentation. Empirical analysis reveals excitation responses don't become increasingly specialized with encoder depth due to skip connections, and their effectiveness relates to global statistics of instance variability.

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [11] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified-VQA is a diagnostic mixture-of-experts framework for video quality assessment that provides both global quality scores and interpretable artifact vectors across multiple video formats without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA methods lack diagnostic feedback and interpretability, and are typically specialized for specific formats rather than being truly generic solutions that can handle diverse perceptual domains.

Method: Proposes Unified-VQA with multiple perceptual experts for distinct domains, using multi-proxy expert training with ranking-inspired loss, and a diagnostic multi-task head for global quality scores and artifact vectors optimized via weakly-supervised learning.

Result: Unified-VQA outperforms 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection across 17 databases with diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR, and HFR formats, without retraining or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The framework represents an important step toward practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment by providing unified quality modeling across formats with diagnostic capabilities.

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs on fine-grained speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in videos, focusing on aligning who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech, often being visually solvable or only coarsely evaluating speech, providing limited insight into models' ability to align speakers, speech content, and timing.

Method: Created AV-SpeakerBench with 3,212 multiple-choice questions featuring: (1) speaker-centered formulation treating speakers as core reasoning units, (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics, and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity.

Result: Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems, addressing the gap in evaluating speech understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

### [13] [Exploring the Potentials of Spiking Neural Networks for Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02258)
*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron and spiking-based modules for image deraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 13% energy consumption compared to existing SNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks like image deraining. Traditional spiking neurons lack spatial contextual understanding and suffer from frequency-domain saturation, limiting their effectiveness in such applications.

Method: Proposes Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron to address spatial context limitations. Introduces Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning, overcoming frequency-domain saturation issues.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks, demonstrating the potential of biologically plausible frameworks in practical computer vision applications.

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

TL;DR: SPF is a new flow matching approach for climate emulation that uses spatiotemporal pyramids to enable efficient, parallel generation across multiple timescales, outperforming baselines on ClimateBench and scaling with the new ClimateSuite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models for climate emulation rely on weather-scale autoregression, which is slow for long climate horizons and hasn't demonstrated stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. There's a need for more efficient and stable climate emulation methods.

Method: Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF) - a flow matching approach that models data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. It partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution while coupling each stage with specific timescales. Each stage is conditioned on prescribed physical forcings (greenhouse gases, aerosols).

Result: SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models on ClimateBench at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. The scaled SPF model shows good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models.

Conclusion: SPF and the accompanying ClimateSuite dataset provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios, addressing limitations of previous autoregressive approaches.

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning CogVideo for progressive image restoration tasks by generating restoration trajectories instead of natural motion, achieving improved perceptual metrics and temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video models have strong temporal generation capabilities but their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. The paper aims to repurpose these models for visual restoration tasks.

Method: Fine-tune CogVideo to generate restoration trajectories using synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement. Compare two prompting strategies: uniform text prompts and scene-specific prompts generated via LLaVA and refined with ChatGPT.

Result: The fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, improving PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics across frames. It effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence, and generalizes to real-world scenarios without additional training.

Conclusion: CogVideo can be successfully repurposed for progressive visual restoration tasks, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration, opening new applications for text-to-video models beyond natural motion generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORP-Synth improves SAR oil spill segmentation transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions using morphological perturbation and generative texture synthesis, boosting performance by +6 mIoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, especially problematic for Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data is scarce.

Method: Two-stage synthetic augmentation framework: Stage A applies Morphological Region Perturbation (curvature-guided label space method) to generate realistic geometric variations; Stage B renders SAR-like textures from edited masks using conditional generative INADE model.

Result: Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8% to 51.8% mIoU on Peruvian domain; MORP-Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Conclusion: MORP-Synth effectively addresses domain shift in SAR oil spill segmentation by generating realistic synthetic data, improving model transferability from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions despite limited labeled data availability.

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised trackers struggle with visually similar objects when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting scalability without extensive labeled data.

Method: Leverages pre-trained video diffusion models that inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training, capitalizing on the denoising process that isolates motion in early, high-noise stages.

Result: Achieves up to 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and new tests focused on tracking visually similar items.

Conclusion: Diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations, addressing a key failure point in existing methods.

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

TL;DR: TALO: A plug-and-play framework using Thin Plate Spline for long-term temporal alignment of 3D vision foundation model predictions in online scenarios, improving consistency across time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D vision foundation models show strong generalization but struggle with temporal consistency in online settings like driving scenarios. Existing alignment methods have limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness to noisy geometry.

Method: Proposes a higher-DOF alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline with globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. Uses point-agnostic submap registration design for robustness to noisy geometry predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups (monocular or surround-view).

Conclusion: The framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations, demonstrating robustness and generality for temporal alignment in online 3D vision applications.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs have achieved success in SAR tasks but their opacity and complexity hinder high-reliability requirements, limiting SAR applications. Improving CNN interpretability is crucial for SAR development and deployment.

Method: Proposed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) matches SAR images with CNN feature maps and gradients, combining both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize decision basis.

Result: Experiments on SAR target classification dataset show MS-CAM more accurately highlights network regions of interest and captures detailed target features, enhancing interpretability. Feasibility for weakly-supervised object localization validated with analysis of key factors like pixel thresholds.

Conclusion: MS-CAM improves CNN interpretability for SAR applications by providing better visualization of decision basis, enabling weakly-supervised localization and informing future work through analysis of localization accuracy factors.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

*Shwai He,Chaorui Deng,Ang Li,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes inefficiencies in unified multimodal models, finds generation components are sensitive to compression, and proposes Mixture-of-Experts adaptation to restore performance with sparse activation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified multimodal models integrating both understanding and generation capabilities introduce inference inefficiencies, as specific tasks or samples may not require the full model capacity. There's limited systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components.

Method: 1) Systematic analysis using training-free pruning as probing methodology (depth pruning and width reduction) to study component compressibility. 2) Proposed Mixture-of-Experts Adaptation that partitions generation module into multiple experts with sparse activation to restore generation quality. 3) Validated through expert-frozen tuning and fully trainable adaptation.

Result: Understanding components show notable compressibility, especially in generation tasks. Generation components are highly sensitive to compression with sharp performance deterioration. MoE adaptation enables BAGEL model to achieve comparable performance to full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Conclusion: The study reveals component-specific inefficiencies in unified multimodal models and demonstrates that sparse activation via Mixture-of-Experts adaptation can effectively address generation component sensitivity while maintaining performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WSCF-MVCC is a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method that uses only crowd counts as supervision instead of expensive density maps or camera calibrations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view crowd counting methods require costly camera calibrations and dense crowd annotations. Calibration-free methods still need expensive image-level annotations. There's a need for more practical methods with minimal supervision requirements.

Method: Proposes WSCF-MVCC that uses only crowd counts as supervision for single-view counting module, employs self-supervised ranking loss with multi-scale priors to enhance perception without extra annotations, and leverages semantic information for more accurate view matching.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, demonstrating superior performance without requiring camera calibrations or dense annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly-supervised calibration-free approach is more suitable for practical deployment than calibrated methods, offering effective crowd counting with minimal supervision requirements.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

TL;DR: VACoT is a framework that dynamically applies image augmentations during VLM inference to improve robustness on challenging inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios, without requiring expensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs rely heavily on large-scale real data or synthetic diversity but struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle well. The high cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs makes continued training on augmented data inefficient with diminishing returns.

Method: VACoT dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference, incorporating post-hoc transformations like denoising. It uses a structured collection of general visual augmentations (beyond just local cropping) with efficient agentic reinforcement learning and a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses.

Result: VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks demonstrate superiority, and the introduced AdvOCR benchmark highlights generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations.

Conclusion: VACoT provides an effective framework for improving VLM robustness through dynamic inference-time augmentations, addressing limitations of current approaches while reducing training complexity and computational overhead.

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

*Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Peifeng Zhang,Haohuan Fu,Juepeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a style-adaptive generalization framework that synthesizes visual prompts to improve frozen model performance on unseen domains without modifying model weights, addressing privacy constraints in semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain adaptation methods require access to model parameters, which is often impossible due to privacy and security constraints. There's a need for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights when dealing with frozen models.

Method: SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles. It uses style transfer to construct diverse style representations from the source domain, then adaptively fuses these style cues based on visual context to form dynamic prompts that harmonize image appearance without modifying the model interior.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints, and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and unseen domain diversity through a closed-loop design that synthesizes adaptive visual prompts, offering a practical solution for domain generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time UAV photogrammetry is crucial for time-critical applications like disaster response, but existing methods lack quality evaluation and feedback mechanisms to guide image acquisition during flight.

Method: An explore-and-exploit framework with three integrated modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation from sparse 3D point clouds, (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators, and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement.

Result: The method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time, reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs through actionable feedback, and enables adaptive exploration workflows.

Conclusion: The framework represents a transition from traditional passive photogrammetry to intelligent, adaptive exploration workflows by integrating data collection, processing, reconstruction, assessment, and online feedback.

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

TL;DR: FDTA is a feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness in end-to-end MOT by addressing inter-object similarity issues through spatial, temporal, and identity adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end MOT methods have strong detection but low association accuracy due to excessively high inter-object similarity in object embeddings from DETR architecture, which only emphasizes category-level discrimination within single frames rather than instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity.

Method: FDTA introduces explicit feature refinement through three complementary adapters: Spatial Adapter (SA) integrates depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, Temporal Adapter (TA) aggregates historical information for temporal dependencies, and Identity Adapter (IA) uses quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability.

Result: FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, demonstrating the effectiveness of the discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed FDTA framework successfully addresses the association accuracy limitations in end-to-end MOT by enhancing object discriminativeness through complementary spatial, temporal, and identity feature refinement, leading to superior tracking performance.

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Conclusion: The camera-guided radar labeling pipeline provides an effective solution to the dataset scarcity problem in radar perception research, enabling reproducible training and evaluation of 4D radar semantic segmentation models while also quantifying fog effects on labeling performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Conclusion: Sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without reliance on reinforcement learning, demonstrating the effectiveness of unified multimodal planning and interleaved reasoning.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-goal navigation approaches in open-vocabulary settings suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rates when locating unseen objects. There's a need for more transparent and effective methods that can handle novel objects in unfamiliar environments.

Method: The framework explicitly models two critical relationships: target-environment modeling and environment-action planning through structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning. It uses a Similarity-Aware Memory that preserves target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations without adding parameters. A NavR²-CoT dataset teaches the model to perceive environments, focus on target-related objects, and make action plans.

Result: Nav-R² achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline. It avoids overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the challenges of opaque decision-making and low success rates in open-vocabulary object-goal navigation by combining structured reasoning with efficient memory mechanisms, enabling effective localization of novel objects in unseen environments.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines by ensuring precise wall segmentation with improved boundary accuracy and thin structure detection.

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

TL;DR: GuiDG framework improves domain generalization in vision-language models by training multiple domain experts instead of a single universal model, using prompt tuning and cross-modal attention for adaptive expert integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for vision-language models face a trade-off between domain specificity and generalization ability. Fine-tuning a universal model on entire datasets compromises generalization to unseen domains, creating a need for better approaches.

Method: Two-step GuiDG framework: 1) Uses prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts from partitioned domains, 2) Introduces Cross-Modal Attention module to guide vision encoder fine-tuning through adaptive expert integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and newly constructed ImageNet-DG show GuiDG outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: Training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains provides better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model, validated by the proposed GuiDG framework's superior performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Motivation: Real-world GUI environments (PC software, mobile apps) are complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation, which hinders systematic investigation of agent navigation capabilities.

Method: Introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs while providing full access to environment information. Training approach uses supervised fine-tuning for fundamental knowledge, single-turn reinforcement learning for generalization, and multi-turn reinforcement learning for exploration strategies.

Methods validated on both static and interactive benchmarks with effective generalization to real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents through the proposed simulation environment and training methodology.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: WorldMM is a multimodal memory agent for long video understanding that uses episodic, semantic, and visual memories with adaptive retrieval across multiple temporal scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video LLMs struggle with hours-long videos due to limited context capacity and loss of visual details. Current memory-augmented methods rely too heavily on text summaries and fixed temporal scales, failing to capture complex visual evidence and variable-duration events.

Method: WorldMM constructs three complementary memory types: episodic memory for factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory for continuously updated conceptual knowledge, and visual memory for detailed scene information. An adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects relevant memory sources and temporal granularities based on queries.

Result: WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: WorldMM demonstrates effective long video reasoning through its multimodal memory architecture with adaptive retrieval, addressing limitations of text-heavy approaches and fixed temporal scales in existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

TL;DR: LightHCG is a lightweight causal representation learning model for glaucoma detection that uses 93-99% fewer parameters than existing vision models while achieving high classification performance and enabling AI-driven intervention analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven glaucoma detection models have limitations in reliability, parameter efficiency, susceptibility to spurious correlations, and lack of capability for intervention analysis. There's a need for more efficient, causal-aware models that can better support clinical applications.

Method: LightHCG uses a Convolutional VAE-based architecture with HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder-based unsupervised causal representation learning to capture true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors in the optic nerve region.

Result: The model achieves high glaucoma classification performance while using 93-99% fewer parameters compared to existing advanced vision models like InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, and enhances capabilities for AI-driven intervention analysis.

Conclusion: LightHCG represents a significant advancement in glaucoma detection AI by combining lightweight architecture with causal representation learning, addressing key limitations of current approaches while enabling new clinical applications like intervention analysis.

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical healthcare faces challenges in obtaining detailed annotations, requiring robust VLMs. Contrastive learning for VLM training demands large batch sizes, making it computationally expensive and limiting accessibility. With limited healthcare data, there's a need to efficiently extract knowledge from both data and models during training.

Method: Proposes momentum self-distillation combined with gradient accumulation to enhance multimodal learning. Leverages momentum self-distillation for knowledge extraction and integrates momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge effective batch size without increasing resource consumption.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with SOTA in zero-shot classification, substantial improvement in few-shot adaptation (over 90% AUC-ROC), and 2-3% improvement in retrieval tasks. Maintains high training efficiency with single GPU and reasonable training time.

Conclusion: The method advances efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods, making VLM training more accessible for healthcare applications with limited data and computational resources.

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods.

TL;DR: BOLT extracts orthogonal spectral bases from existing fine-tuned models and adapts new tasks within that subspace with minimal training, providing efficient transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meta-learning approaches require expensive meta-training phases and can be unstable, while many task-specific pre-trained models exist but lack efficient transfer methods to new tasks with minimal training.

Method: BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors, orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases, then freezes these bases and trains only small diagonal coefficients per layer for new tasks, yielding rank-controlled updates.

Result: BOLT achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines and meta-learned initialization, providing effective unseen-task transfer with minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace offers an effective alternative for transferring to unseen tasks with minimal data and compute budgets.

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

TL;DR: TDE enhances SNNs for object detection by generating diverse temporal stimuli and using spike-driven attention to reduce energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNNs have limited expressive power because they replicate or aggregate inputs at fixed intervals, causing neurons to receive nearly identical stimuli across time steps, which is particularly problematic for complex tasks like object detection.

Method: Proposes Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) with two modules: Spiking Encoder (SE) generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and Attention Gating Module (AGM) guides SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Also introduces Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to eliminate high-energy multiplication operations from AGM.

Result: TDE achieves mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on PASCAL VOC and 47.6% on EvDET200K dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Conclusion: TDE effectively enhances SNNs' temporal information modeling capacity for object detection while maintaining energy efficiency through spike-driven attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

Motivation: To provide an unprecedented look into the creation and technical details of nuScenes dataset, trace its influence on the autonomous driving community, and offer a comprehensive survey of literature using this foundational dataset.

Method: Revisiting and analyzing the nuScenes dataset creation process, examining its extensions (nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes), tracing its influence on subsequent datasets, and reviewing methodological developments in AV research using nuScenes.

Result: Revealed previously undisclosed technical details about nuScenes creation, demonstrated its pioneering role as the first dataset with radar data and diverse urban scenes from two continents, and showed its significant impact on defining community standards and influencing numerous subsequent datasets.

Conclusion: nuScenes represents a foundational building block in autonomous driving research that exemplifies key AV development trends, established numerous community standards, and continues to shape the field through its comprehensive sensor fusion approach and broad task coverage.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

*Valentin Bieri,Marie-Julie Rakotosaona,Keisuke Tateno,Francis Engelmann,Leonidas Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HouseLayout3D is a real-world benchmark for full building-scale 3D layout estimation, addressing limitations of current models that only handle single rooms/floors. MultiFloor3D is a training-free baseline that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D layout estimation models are limited to synthetic datasets with simple single room/floor environments, requiring scene splitting that removes global spatial context essential for multi-level structures like staircases.

Method: Introduces HouseLayout3D benchmark for real-world multi-floor building layout estimation, and presents MultiFloor3D - a simple training-free baseline leveraging recent scene understanding methods.

Result: MultiFloor3D outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both the new HouseLayout3D benchmark and prior datasets, demonstrating the need for further research in full building-scale layout estimation.

Conclusion: The work highlights the gap in current 3D layout estimation capabilities and provides both a benchmark (HouseLayout3D) and baseline method (MultiFloor3D) to drive progress toward handling complex multi-floor buildings.

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

*Sourabh Sharma,Sonam Gupta,Sadbhawna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STL is a self-training framework that improves multimodal reasoning in VLMs by generating structured rationales (see attributes first, then reason) and using negative rationales to enhance discriminative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with multimodal reasoning due to weaknesses in either perception or reasoning. Existing methods to enhance reasoning rely on expensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training that ignores perception, creating a need for a cost-effective solution that jointly improves both perception and reasoning.

Method: STL introduces a structured reasoning template that separates perception ("see") from reasoning ("think"): first extract visual attributes in textual form, then use them to guide reasoning. The framework uses self-training where the model generates and learns from its own structured rationales, augmented with negative rationales (explanations for incorrect answers) to enhance discriminative learning.

Result: Experiments across diverse domains show STL consistently outperforms baselines trained only on answers or self-generated reasoning. Qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales.

Conclusion: STL provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs by jointly improving perception and reasoning through structured self-training with negative rationales.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

### [42] [Does Hearing Help Seeing? Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02457)
*Jianzong Wu,Hao Lian,Dachao Hao,Ye Tian,Qingyu Shi,Biaolong Chen,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Audio-video joint denoising training improves video generation quality even when only video quality matters, by using audio as a privileged signal that helps model physical cause-effect relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether audio-video joint denoising training can improve video generation quality beyond just achieving audio-video synchrony, even when the primary goal is video quality alone.

Method: Introduced AVFullDiT architecture leveraging pre-trained T2V and T2A modules for joint denoising. Trained two models: T2AV with audio-video joint denoising and T2V-only counterpart under identical settings for comparison.

Result: Audio-video joint denoising consistently improves video generation, especially on challenging subsets with large motions and object contacts. Audio acts as a privileged signal that helps model causal relationships between visual events and acoustic consequences.

Conclusion: Cross-modal co-training (audio-video joint denoising) is a promising approach for developing stronger, more physically grounded world models that go beyond just achieving synchrony between modalities.

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

*Zhongyi Cai,Yi Du,Chen Wang,Yu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEER-Bench introduces a benchmark for sequential embodied AI tasks, and 3DSPMR is a novel approach that incorporates 3D spatial memory with geometric cues into MLLMs for improved reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing embodied AI research focuses on single tasks, but real-world deployment requires agents to handle sequential tasks where knowledge from previous explorations needs to be reused for subsequent reasoning. Current approaches don't adequately address the challenge of reusing spatial knowledge across sequential sub-tasks, especially when some sub-tasks may be infeasible.

Method: The authors introduce SEER-Bench, a benchmark for sequential embodied exploration and reasoning covering Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). They propose 3DSPMR (3D Spatial Memory Reasoning), which leverages relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to enhance Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for sequential embodied tasks, explicitly incorporating geometric information for spatial understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments show that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: This work addresses the important but underexplored challenge of sequential embodied AI tasks by introducing a comprehensive benchmark and a novel approach that effectively incorporates geometric information into MLLM-based spatial reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements in sequential embodied task performance.

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

*Fengli Ran,Xiao Pu,Bo Liu,Xiuli Bi,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGDD improves dataset distillation by dynamically aligning feature distributions along the model's training trajectory, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 5.0% accuracy gains on high-resolution benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current distribution matching methods for dataset distillation overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, limiting synthetic data expressiveness and weakening downstream performance.

Method: TGDD reformulates distribution matching as dynamic alignment along the model's training trajectory, capturing evolving semantics at each stage while introducing distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap.

Result: TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten datasets with notable 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks, balancing performance and efficiency without additional optimization overhead.

Conclusion: TGDD effectively addresses limitations of static distribution matching by incorporating training trajectory dynamics, improving synthetic data quality for better downstream task performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

TL;DR: WorldPack is a video world model with compressed memory that improves long-term spatial consistency and generation quality in video prediction, evaluated on Minecraft's LoopNav benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video world models struggle with temporally- and spatially-consistent long-term world modeling due to prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs.

Method: WorldPack uses efficient compressed memory with two components: trajectory packing for high context efficiency, and memory retrieval to maintain consistency in rollouts and support spatial reasoning for long-term generations.

Result: WorldPack significantly outperforms strong state-of-the-art models on the LoopNav benchmark for Minecraft, demonstrating notable improvements in spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation.

Conclusion: WorldPack addresses the long-standing problem of consistent long-term world modeling through efficient compressed memory, achieving superior performance in video world modeling tasks requiring spatial reasoning and consistency.

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: G-SHARP provides a commercially viable solution for real-time surgical scene reconstruction, overcoming deployment limitations of previous approaches while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and practical usability in operating-room environments.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue.

TL;DR: UCAgents is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that enforces unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing to address reasoning detachment in medical VLMs, achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in medical diagnosis suffer from reasoning detachment where explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Existing multi-agent frameworks for MDT debates amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence.

Method: UCAgents enforces unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing, forbidding position changes and limiting agent interactions to targeted evidence verification. It introduces a one-round inquiry discussion to uncover visual-textual misalignment risks, jointly constraining visual ambiguity and textual noise via information theory.

Result: Achieves 71.3% accuracy on PathVQA (+6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost. Strikes balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference.

Conclusion: UCAgents demonstrates both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment, effectively addressing reasoning detachment in medical VLMs through structured evidence auditing.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 3D-SLIM replaces causal attention masks with adaptive spatial masks for 3D scene-language understanding, addressing sequential bias and restricted instruction attention without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use standard causal attention masks from language modeling, which create two conflicts in 3D understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention that hinders task-specific reasoning.

Method: Proposes 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM) with two components: Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context.

Result: 3D-SLIM yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks, validated through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines.

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM demonstrates the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning, providing a simple, parameter-free solution that adapts attention to spatial structure while maintaining instruction guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVSeg introduces an explicit decomposition approach for reasoning-centric video object segmentation, using sequential decisions in pretrained VLMs with three explicit operations and reinforcement learning optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video object segmentation solutions collapse complex reasoning about dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions into simplified latent embeddings, making the reasoning chain opaque and intractable.

Method: ReVSeg decomposes reasoning into three explicit sequential operations: semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding, using pretrained VLMs. It employs reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain for self-refinement.

Result: ReVSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and produces interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition of reasoning operations combined with reinforcement learning optimization enables more effective and interpretable video object segmentation compared to latent embedding approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Motivation: Existing diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation lack exploration in music-performance videos with camera motions, and current long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control.

Method: A cascaded framework integrating audio semantic analysis, interpretable shot planning (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, long-sequence consistency modeling, camera adapter module for embedding camera poses, and time-aware dynamic window range strategy for adaptive denoising.

Result: Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos with precise music-motion-camera synchronization, supported by a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset.

Conclusion: YingVideo-MV enables automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals, achieving superior results in music-driven long-video generation with camera motion control.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM jailbreak attacks focus on text-image interplay and treat visual modality as secondary prompts, underutilizing images' potential to carry complex contextual information for attacks.

Method: Contextual Image Attack (CIA) uses a multi-agent system to embed harmful queries into benign visual contexts with four visualization strategies, plus contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques.

Result: CIA achieves toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, with ASR reaching 86.31% and 91.07% on MMSafetyBench-tiny, significantly outperforming prior work.

Conclusion: The visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs, demonstrating that image-centric attacks can effectively bypass safety alignments.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Motivation: Current evaluations of test-time adaptation for medical image segmentation are limited in modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency, creating a need for standardized benchmarking to enable reliable comparison and clinical application.

Method: Created MedSeg-TTA benchmark with 20 representative adaptation methods across 7 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, chest X-ray) using fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test-time protocols. Examined four adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation.

Result: No single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer advantages in boundary-related metrics. Prior-based methods show strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts.

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA establishes a rigorous foundation for test-time adaptation research in medical imaging by providing standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, highlighting the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment based on specific domain shift characteristics.

Conclusion: The unified end-to-end paradigm for document layout parsing enables robust performance across diverse languages, layouts, and domains, advancing document intelligence research and AI's access to structured knowledge.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

TL;DR: GeoDiT is a diffusion-based vision-language model for geospatial tasks that outperforms autoregressive models by using parallel refinement instead of sequential generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are fundamentally misaligned with geospatial understanding because they impose rigid sequential narratives onto scenes, hindering structured and coherent output generation.

Method: Introduces GeoDiT, a diffusion-based vision-language model that reframes geospatial generation as parallel refinement process, enabling holistic coarse-to-fine synthesis where all semantic elements are resolved simultaneously.

Result: GeoDiT establishes new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs, achieving significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection.

Conclusion: Aligning the generative process with data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis, validating the parallel refinement approach over autoregressive methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-SR is a two-stage Vision Transformer approach for single image super-resolution that uses self-supervised pre-training on colorization followed by fine-tuning for 4x SR, achieving strong results on DIV2K benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) remains challenging in computer vision. The paper aims to improve SISR performance by leveraging Vision Transformers with a novel training strategy that incorporates self-supervised learning to learn rich visual representations.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Self-supervised pretraining on a colorization task to learn generalizable visual representations, 2) Fine-tuning for 4x super-resolution by predicting high-frequency residual images added to bicubic interpolation, simplifying residual learning.

Result: On DIV2K benchmark dataset, ViT-SR achieves SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB for 4x super-resolution, demonstrating strong performance.

Conclusion: The two-stage approach with self-supervised pre-training is effective for complex image restoration tasks. Larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks could yield further improvements.

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision-language models are suboptimal for remote sensing tasks, and existing geospatial VLMs struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception with global contextual understanding.

Method: SkyMoE employs: 1) Adaptive router generating task- and granularity-aware routing instructions for specialized LLM experts; 2) Context-disentangled augmentation creating contrastive pairs between local and global features for level-specific representation learning; 3) MGRS-Bench benchmark for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating SkyMoE's adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Conclusion: SkyMoE effectively addresses the limitations of existing geospatial VLMs by providing specialized expert handling for diverse remote sensing tasks with balanced local-global perception, achieving superior performance through its Mixture-of-Experts architecture and granularity-aware design.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

TL;DR: This dissertation addresses zero-shot anomaly classification/segmentation challenges, introducing CoDeGraph for filtering consistent anomalies, extending to 3D medical imaging, and bridging batch-based/text-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot anomaly detection is crucial for industrial inspection and medical imaging where training data is unavailable. The research addresses core challenges including consistent anomalies that bias distance-based methods.

Method: 1) Formalized consistent anomaly problem and analyzed patch representation behavior; 2) Developed CoDeGraph framework using multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement; 3) Extended to 3D medical imaging with volumetric tokenization; 4) Bridged methods using CoDeGraph pseudo-masks to supervise vision-language models.

Result: Identified similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena in patch representations; CoDeGraph effectively suppresses consistent anomalies; Achieved zero-shot 3D anomaly segmentation without training samples; Demonstrated integration of batch-based and text-based approaches.

Conclusion: The dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for zero-shot anomaly classification/segmentation, addressing consistent anomalies, enabling 3D medical applications, and bridging different methodological approaches.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of efficiently connecting pre-trained Vision-Language Models with Diffusion Models while overcoming task generalization collapse that occurs when methods using fixed learnable query tokens fail to adapt to new tasks distant from pre-training tasks.

Method: Introduces Noisy Query Tokens that learn a distributed representation space between VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization. Also adds a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details.

Result: Experimental results confirm the approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the generalization limitations of existing approaches and provides a stable framework for continual learning in multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free acceleration method for multi-view 3D models achieves 8-10× speedup while maintaining accuracy by converting early global layers to frame attention and subsampling global attention with diagonal preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D models like VGGT and π³ rely heavily on global self-attention, resulting in high computational costs. While sparse-attention variants offer some speed improvements, there's no systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning.

Method: 1) Conducted in-depth analysis of global attention modules in VGGT and π³, revealing distinct roles in alternating global-frame architecture. 2) Proposed training-free two-step acceleration: convert early global layers to frame attention, and subsample global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and mean-fill component.

Result: Achieved 8-10× speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving accuracy of original models. Method remains robust in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free acceleration scheme effectively reduces computational cost of multi-view 3D models by strategically modifying attention mechanisms based on systematic analysis of their functional roles, enabling efficient inference without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Conclusion: OmniPerson provides an effective solution for generating high-quality, identity-consistent pedestrian data for ReID tasks, addressing data scarcity issues while offering unprecedented control over generation parameters. The method will be open-sourced with full codebase, pretrained model, and PersonSyn dataset.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Panel2Patch is a novel biomedical vision-language pretraining pipeline that extracts hierarchical supervision from scientific figures by parsing layouts, panels, and visual markers to create multi-granular vision-language pairs, enabling better performance with less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biomedical vision-language pretraining compresses rich scientific figures into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding fine-grained correspondences that clinicians rely on when examining local structures. This limits the effectiveness of learned representations.

Method: Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers from scientific figures and captions, constructing hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at figure, panel, and patch levels. It uses a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse descriptions to fine region-focused phrases.

Result: By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of literature figures, the method extracts far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Conclusion: Panel2Patch addresses the limitation of coarse figure-level pretraining by mining hierarchical structure from biomedical literature, preserving local semantics and enabling more effective vision-language representations for biomedical applications.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

*Yafei Song,Peng Zhang,Bang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for generating synchronized co-speech gestures using diffusion models and motion graph retrieval, addressing the many-to-many mapping challenge between audio and gestures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using motion graphs with one-to-one audio-motion mapping are suboptimal for the many-to-many nature of audio-gesture relationships, limiting synchronization accuracy and naturalness.

Method: 1) Diffusion model learns joint audio-motion distribution using both low-level and high-level audio features; 2) Motion-based retrieval algorithm finds optimal path in motion graph using global and local similarity; 3) Seamless stitching of discontinuous motion segments.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvement over prior approaches in synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the many-to-many audio-gesture mapping problem through diffusion modeling and sophisticated motion retrieval, producing more synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on visual perception, aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence, but neglect rule-based reasoning capabilities. There's a need for fine-grained decomposition and comprehensive evaluation of reasoning abilities in video generation models.

Method: Built RULER-Bench covering 40 representative tasks across 6 rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. Uses text-to-video and image-to-video paradigms. Constructs evaluation checklist with 4 metrics and leverages GPT-o3 for scoring, achieving 85% alignment with human judgments.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models achieve only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, indicating significant room for improvement in reasoning capabilities. The benchmark shows current models lack strong rule-based reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench fills a critical gap in evaluating reasoning capabilities of video generation models. The poor performance on rule coherence highlights the need for development of reasoning-aware video generation to advance toward vision foundation intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion suffer from poor generalization due to limited real training data and domain gaps between different satellite sensors. There's a need for models that can perform well on unseen datasets from various sensors.

Method: Construct diverse simulated datasets by applying degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. Pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn robust spatial-spectral priors, then evaluate using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms with full- and freeze-tuning approaches across six satellite datasets.

Models achieve superior zero-shot results and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

Conclusion: This work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion, and demonstrates the potential of leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies to overcome domain gaps between satellite sensors.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SelVA introduces text-conditioned selective video-to-audio generation that produces only user-intended sounds from multi-object videos, addressing the limitation of current approaches that generate mixed sounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A methods generate single source-mixed sounds at once due to entangled visual features and insufficient source specification, while multimedia production requires individual audio tracks for precise editing and creative control.

Method: SelVA treats text prompts as explicit source selectors, modulates video encoder to extract prompt-relevant features, uses supplementary tokens to suppress text-irrelevant activations via cross-attention, and employs self-augmentation to overcome mono audio track supervision limitations.

Result: Extensive experiments on VGG-MONOAUDIO benchmark show SelVA's effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization, with consistent performance verified through ablations.

Conclusion: SelVA successfully addresses the selective V2A generation task by using text prompts as source selectors and modulating visual features, enabling precise audio generation from multi-object videos for multimedia production applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

### [67] [Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660)
*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid architecture combines ColPali's patch-level visual similarity with OCR bounding boxes for precise region retrieval in documents, enabling better RAG without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs like ColPali retrieve entire pages but lack precision for RAG, while OCR systems have spatial coordinates but lack semantic relevance assessment. Need to combine both for precise region retrieval.

Method: Unifies VLM patch-level similarity scores with OCR bounding boxes by formalizing coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR regions, using similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions with intersection metrics for relevance propagation.

Result: Theoretical bounds on retrieval precision established; approach operates at inference time without additional training; open-source implementation (Snappy) released with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Conclusion: Hybrid architecture successfully bridges gap between visual semantic retrieval and precise spatial localization, enabling more effective document region retrieval for RAG applications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

*Derui Shan,Qian Qiao,Hao Lu,Tao Du,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR integrates polarization cues with 3D Gaussian Splatting to achieve real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of specular scenes without environment maps or restrictive material assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for specular scene reconstruction have limitations: Polarization-aware NeRF is slow and dependent on material/viewpoint assumptions, while 3DGS struggles with reflection-geometry entanglement and requires environment maps for reflection modeling.

Method: Proposes a polarization-forward-guided paradigm with bidirectional coupling: 1) uses 3DGS geometric priors to resolve polarization ambiguity, 2) uses refined polarization cues to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation, enabling reflection separation without environment maps.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis on public and self-collected datasets while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: First framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, providing superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes without restrictive assumptions.

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

Conclusion: UAUTrack successfully addresses the lack of unified cross-modal collaboration in Anti-UAV tracking by providing an effective framework that integrates multiple modalities with a text prompt strategy, achieving superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-Mamba: A deformable Mamba-based framework for 3D hand pose estimation that addresses occlusion challenges by capturing global context through selective state modeling and deformable scanning, outperforming CNN and other Mamba backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D hand pose estimation methods struggle with severe occlusions (like overlapping hands) due to limited global context modeling in CNN-based feature extractors like ResNet, which hampers learning relationships between local features and global cues.

Method: Proposes Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba) framework using state space modeling (Mamba) with deformable state scanning. It aggregates local convolution features while selectively preserving useful global context cues through deformable scanning, enabling better handling of occlusions.

Result: DF-Mamba outperforms latest image backbones (VMamba, Spatial-Mamba) on all five diverse datasets covering single/two-hand scenarios, hand-only/hand-object interactions, and RGB/depth-based estimation. Achieves state-of-the-art performance with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50.

Conclusion: DF-Mamba effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D hand pose estimation by capturing global context through Mamba's selective state modeling and deformable scanning, demonstrating superior performance over existing backbones while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Zhongbao Yang,Jiangxin Dong,Yazhou Yao,Jinhui Tang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGP-DiffSR is a lightweight diffusion method for image super-resolution that reduces computational costs through progressive pruning and phase-guided restoration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution models rely on large backbones like SDXL and DiT, which cause excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. There's a need for more efficient diffusion methods for super-resolution.

Method: The method has two main components: 1) Progressive pruning approach to remove redundant blocks from diffusion backbones while preserving restoration capability, and 2) Phase-exchange adapter module that uses phase information from inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption compared to existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR successfully addresses the efficiency problem in diffusion-based super-resolution by combining progressive pruning with phase-guided restoration, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech in online videos is a growing threat, and existing methods struggle with complex multimodal semantic relationships and nuanced hateful content understanding.

Method: Proposes Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) with: 1) Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) for capturing local cues and global temporal structures, 2) Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) for fine-grained multimodal interaction, and 3) adversarial reasoning using a vision-language model to generate objective descriptions and both hate/non-hate inferences.

Result: Achieves robust generalization, improving state-of-the-art by 3% in Macro-F1 and 7% in hate class recall on two real-world hateful video datasets.

Conclusion: RAMF effectively addresses multimodal fusion challenges and nuanced hateful content understanding, demonstrating superior performance for hate speech detection in videos.

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

TL;DR: FASA is a two-stage foreground-aware slot attention framework that explicitly separates foreground from background using dual-slot competition and pseudo-mask guidance to improve unsupervised object discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods process foreground and background indiscriminately, causing background interference and suboptimal instance discovery on real-world data. The paper aims to address this limitation by explicitly modeling foreground-background separation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Coarse scene decomposition with dual-slot competition to distinguish foreground from background using clustering-based initialization. 2) Masked slot attention where first slot captures background and remaining slots compete for foreground objects, with pseudo-mask guidance from patch affinity graphs using self-supervised features to prevent over-segmentation.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

Conclusion: FASA successfully addresses background interference in unsupervised object discovery through explicit foreground-background separation and pseudo-mask guidance, achieving superior performance in scene decomposition and object representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

### [74] [ClimaOoD: Improving Anomaly Segmentation via Physically Realistic Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02686)
*Yuxing Liu,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClimaDrive is a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing realistic out-of-distribution driving data with weather diversity, and ClimaOoD is a large-scale benchmark that improves anomaly segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly segmentation for autonomous driving suffers from limited and non-diverse anomaly data, while existing synthetic data generation methods lack contextual coherence and physical realism, creating domain gaps.

Method: ClimaDrive framework unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting to create semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data.

Result: Training with ClimaOoD benchmark leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation across four state-of-the-art methods, with AUROC, AP, and FPR95 showing notable gains (FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF).

Conclusion: ClimaOoD enhances model robustness and provides valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection, addressing the data scarcity and diversity limitations in anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Adversarial training, while improving model robustness, paradoxically increases the transferability of adversarial examples, creating new ecosystem risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples, which is underexplored despite adversarial training being the leading defense for model robustness.

Method: Trained a diverse zoo of 36 models (including CNNs and ViTs) and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments to analyze how adversarial training affects attack transferability.

Result: Adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, revealing a clear paradox where robustness improvement comes with increased ecosystem risk.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluations should assess both a model's resistance to transferred attacks and its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples; all models, code, and experimental scripts are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoBridge is a foundation model for cross-view geo-localization that uses semantic anchors to bridge multi-view features through textual descriptions, enabling bidirectional matching across drone, satellite, and street views, plus language-to-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional satellite-centric geo-localization has limitations: it's not robust when high-resolution or current satellite imagery is unavailable, and it fails to fully exploit complementary cues across different views (drone, satellite, street) and modalities (language, image).

Method: Proposes GeoBridge with a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions. Also introduces GeoLoc dataset - first large-scale, cross-modal, multi-view aligned dataset with 50,000+ pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images plus textual descriptions from 36 countries.

Result: GeoLoc pre-training significantly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The model performs well across multiple evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: GeoBridge addresses limitations of traditional satellite-centric approaches by enabling robust, flexible localization through multi-view and cross-modal matching using semantic anchors, supported by the comprehensive GeoLoc dataset.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-Pruner is a training-free token pruning algorithm for vision-language models that balances redundancy and spatial sparsity to reduce computational costs while preserving object details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face high computational costs due to many visual tokens, hindering mobile deployment. Existing pruning methods either ignore inter-token redundancy or spatial relationships, leading to inefficient pruning or poor object coverage.

Method: Proposes VLM-Pruner with: 1) centrifugal token pruning paradigm for near-to-far selection preserving fine details, 2) Buffering for Spatial Sparsity criterion to defer selection of distant tokens, 3) parallel greedy strategy for efficient selection, and 4) selective fusion of salient information from discarded tokens.

Result: VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with 88.9% pruning rate while delivering end-to-end inference speedup.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free token pruning algorithm effectively balances redundancy and spatial sparsity, enabling efficient VLM deployment on mobile devices while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: MRD is a training-free framework that improves high-resolution image understanding in MLLMs by using multi-resolution semantic fusion to address object fragmentation issues and integrating OVD for direct object localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current crop-based approaches for high-resolution image understanding in MLLMs fragment complete objects across multiple crops, disrupting semantic similarity computation and failing to preserve object integrity.

Method: Proposes Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD) with: 1) multi-resolution semantic fusion that integrates semantic similarity maps from different resolutions to preserve object integrity, and 2) open-vocabulary object detection using sliding-window approach for direct object localization.

Result: Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks with different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRD framework.

Conclusion: MRD addresses the object fragmentation problem in high-resolution image understanding by combining multi-resolution semantic fusion with open-vocabulary detection, improving performance without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: Mean Dice scores of 0.77/0.75 for males/females, 6pp improvement over intensity-only, 9pp/8pp over uniGradICON, 12pp/13pp over MIRTK, with less noisy age-correlation maps and better anatomical alignment.

Conclusion: The proposed registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration accuracy for UK Biobank images, enabling better medical research applications.

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

*Yancheng Zhang,Guangyu Sun,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGGS is a hybrid Gaussian splatting method that combines 2D and 3D Gaussians to achieve better balance between appearance fidelity and geometric accuracy for novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting provides good appearance fidelity but suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, while 2D Gaussian Splatting ensures multi-view consistency but loses texture details. There's a need to balance both appearance and geometry quality.

Method: EGGS integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians using three key components: Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization to exploit strengths of each representation.

Result: Extensive experiments show EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, with CUDA-accelerated implementation enabling efficient training and inference.

Conclusion: EGGS provides a practical solution for high-quality novel view synthesis by effectively balancing appearance fidelity and geometric accuracy through hybrid 2D/3D Gaussian representation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoViS is a geospatially rewarded visual search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process, achieving state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring multimodal large language model capabilities to remote sensing imagery is challenging due to extremely small targets in kilometer-scale scenes and complex geospatial relations involving relative positions, spatial hierarchies, and contextual dependencies across distant objects.

Method: GeoViS reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process using a tree-structured sequence of visual cues. It integrates multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to iteratively refine geospatial hypotheses, actively exploring global images rather than predicting target locations in a single step.

Result: Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics.

Conclusion: GeoViS enables detection of subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness, highlighting strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability for remote sensing visual grounding tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Used VLM-as-a-Judge approach for assessment.

Result: Strong correlation observed between VLM-as-a-Judge assessments and human expert evaluations. The benchmark reveals current video models' limitations in scientific reasoning and provides the first systematic evaluation of video models as scientific reasoners rather than just generators.

Conclusion: VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models as scientific reasoners, requiring generations to demonstrate understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena. It provides valuable insights into current models' scientific reasoning capabilities and establishes a foundation for future development of scientifically-aware video generation systems.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the data availability challenge in UAV localization by enabling training without paired UAV-satellite datasets while maintaining competitive performance, offering a more practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community.

*Rakib Ahsan,MD Sadik Hossain Shanto,Md Sultanul Arifin,Tanzima Hashem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet is an attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, combining NDMI with attention mechanisms to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas contributing to global warming, and accurate detection is crucial for timely action. Current methods (traditional band differences/ratios and CNN-based approaches) suffer from high false positive rates and lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features.

Method: AttMetNet integrates Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net architecture. It uses methane-aware attention mechanisms to selectively amplify methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. The model employs focal loss to address class imbalance from limited plume samples and sparse plume pixels, and is trained on real methane plume datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show AttMetNet outperforms recent methods with lower false positive rate, better precision-recall balance, and higher IoU for methane plume detection in Sentinel-2 imagery.

Conclusion: AttMetNet establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery, offering improved accuracy and practical applicability for climate change mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

### [86] [Rethinking Surgical Smoke: A Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Method and Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02780)
*Qifan Liang,Junlin Li,Zhen Han,Xihao Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Bin Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANet is a smoke-type-aware laparoscopic video desmoking network that distinguishes between Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke, using a mask segmentation sub-network with coarse-to-fine disentanglement and a reconstruction sub-network to remove surgical smoke while preserving visual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical smoke from electrocautery/lasers obstructs visual guidance in laparoscopic videos. Existing desmoking methods fail to account for different smoke types with distinct spatio-temporal characteristics, necessitating a smoke-type-aware approach.

Method: Proposes STANet with two sub-networks: 1) Smoke mask segmentation network using attention-weighted mask aggregation and coarse-to-fine disentanglement module with smoke-type-aware cross attention, 2) Smokeless video reconstruction network guided by two types of smoke masks. Also constructs first large-scale synthetic video dataset with smoke type annotations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations and shows superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks. The method effectively handles both Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke types.

Conclusion: STANet successfully addresses smoke-type-specific distinctions in laparoscopic video desmoking, providing better visual guidance for surgical procedures through its novel smoke-type-aware architecture and disentanglement approach.

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

### [87] [TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789)
*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5 introduces Motion Direction Decoupling and Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement to overcome occlusion and directional ambiguity issues in fast-moving small object tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TrackNet versions (V1-V3) struggle with occlusions due to reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4 suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. These limitations hinder robust tracking of fast-moving small objects in sports.

Method: Two novel mechanisms: 1) Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields to explicitly encode both movement occurrence and trajectory direction, recovering lost directional priors. 2) Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head uses a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine paradigm with factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate corrective residuals for recovering occluded targets.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and accuracy of 0.9733 on TrackNetV2 dataset, significantly outperforming previous versions. Performance leap achieved with only 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities.

Conclusion: TrackNetV5 provides a robust architecture that effectively addresses occlusion and directional ambiguity challenges in fast-moving small object tracking, delivering superior precision while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications.

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

TL;DR: The paper introduces UnicEdit-10M, a 10M-scale dataset for image editing, and UnicBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal models' editing capabilities, addressing the data scarcity and evaluation limitations in open-source image editing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap between closed-source and open-source multimodal models is widening due to scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks that can diagnose model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors.

Method: Introduces a lightweight data pipeline replacing multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and unified post-verification stage. Trains Qwen-Verify, a 7B dual-task expert model for failure detection and instruction recaptioning. Creates UnicEdit-10M dataset and UnicBench benchmark with novel metrics including Non-edit Consistency and Reasoning Accuracy.

Result: Produces UnicEdit-10M, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks, and UnicBench benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. Analysis of mainstream models reveals their limitations.

Conclusion: The proposed data pipeline and benchmark address critical gaps in image editing research, providing scalable high-quality data and comprehensive evaluation tools that reveal model limitations and provide clear directions for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

*Zhiwei Chen,Yupeng Hu,Zixu Li,Zhiheng Fu,Haokun Wen,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HUD is a novel framework for Composed Video Retrieval that addresses modality information density disparity through hierarchical uncertainty-aware disambiguation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CVR and CIR tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CVR approaches overlook the information density disparity between video (rich semantics) and text (sparse semantics) modalities, leading to modification subject referring ambiguity and limited detailed semantic focus, which degrades retrieval performance.

Method: HUD leverages modality information density disparity with three components: Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation for cross-modal interaction, Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling for fine-grained semantics, and Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment for precise composed feature learning.

Result: HUD achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both Composed Video Retrieval and Composed Image Retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HUD framework effectively addresses modality disparity issues in CVR through hierarchical uncertainty-aware disambiguation, enabling precise composed feature learning and superior retrieval performance.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC-World is a novel framework for shared world modeling that generates multiple videos from input images of the same underlying world in different camera poses, using in-context generation capabilities of large video models enhanced with reinforcement learning for geometry and motion consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of shared world modeling, where a model needs to generate multiple videos from input images representing the same underlying world from different camera perspectives. This requires maintaining consistency in both scene-level geometry and object-level motion across all generated videos, which existing methods struggle to achieve.

Method: IC-World leverages the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models to enable parallel generation for all input images. The framework is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization, combined with two novel reward models: one for enforcing scene-level geometry consistency and another for object-level motion consistency across the set of generated videos.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency metrics. The paper represents the first systematic exploration of the shared world modeling problem using video-based world models.

Conclusion: IC-World successfully addresses the shared world modeling problem by combining in-context generation capabilities with reinforcement learning and novel consistency reward models, achieving superior performance in maintaining both geometric and motion consistency across multiple generated videos of the same underlying world.

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyCustom is a fine-tuning framework with two regularization losses that enables diffusion models to accurately customize physical concepts in text-to-image generation, addressing the limitation of current methods that fail to reflect physical properties even when physics-related words appear in prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods excel at concrete concepts like styles and shapes but fail at realistic physical concept customization. The core limitation is the absence of explicit physical knowledge during training, causing models to generate inaccurate physical properties even when physics-related words appear in prompts.

Method: PhyCustom introduces a fine-tuning framework with two novel regularization losses: 1) isometric loss to activate diffusion models to learn physical concepts, and 2) decouple loss to eliminate mixture learning of independent concepts.

Result: Experiments on a diverse dataset show PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in physical customization both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: The proposed PhyCustom framework successfully addresses the physical customization challenge in text-to-image generation by explicitly incorporating physical knowledge through specialized regularization losses, enabling more accurate reflection of physical properties in generated images.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [92] [Are Detectors Fair to Indian IP-AIGC? A Cross-Generator Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02850)
*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic study of identity-preserving AI-generated content detection for Indian/South-Asian faces, revealing detector brittleness to identity-preserving edits and overfitting to training-generator cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern image editors can create identity-preserving AI-generated content (IP-AIGC) where the same person appears with new attributes, but the robustness and fairness of current detectors for under-represented populations like Indian/South-Asian faces remains unclear.

Method: Assembled Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF datasets, constructed two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. Evaluated two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained and fine-tuned regimes using AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy metrics.

Result: Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (e.g., AIDE AUC drops from 0.923 to 0.563), indicating overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP images, pretrained performance remains high, suggesting specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than generic distribution shift.

Conclusion: IP-AIGC detection for Indian faces presents a challenging and practically relevant scenario, motivating representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to address generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online RL post-training framework for video diffusion models improves camera control accuracy through geometry-based rewards and segment-level feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video diffusion models rely mainly on supervised fine-tuning for camera control, leaving online reinforcement learning post-training underexplored despite its potential for better optimization.

Method: Proposes online RL post-training with verifiable geometry reward: estimates 3D camera trajectories for generated/reference videos, divides into segments, computes segment-wise relative poses, and uses alignment scores as dense reward signals to guide optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show the RL post-training framework outperforms SFT baselines in camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality.

Conclusion: Online RL post-training with geometry-based rewards is superior to supervised fine-tuning for advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model.

*Zhuobai Dong,Rui Zhao,Songjie Wu,Junchao Yi,Linjie Li,Zhengyuan Yang,Lijuan Wang,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phase-aware acceleration method for diffusion models using two lightweight LoRA adapters (Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA) that apply different speedups to different denoising phases, achieving up to 5× acceleration with minimal training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have high computational costs and require many inference steps, limiting deployment. Previous distillation methods for fewer steps suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization.

Method: Instead of uniform acceleration, the method applies smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. It uses two lightweight LoRA adapters (Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA) specialized for slow and fast denoising phases, requiring minimal retraining of the base model.

Result: Achieves up to 5× acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. The LoRA experts are trained with only 1 sample on a single V100 within one hour and generalize well to unseen prompts.

Conclusion: The phase-aware strategy with lightweight LoRA adapters provides an efficient and effective approach to accelerate diffusion models with minimal training cost and strong generalization, overcoming limitations of previous distillation methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

TL;DR: DiverseAR improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation by addressing binary classification limitations and sharp logits distributions through adaptive scaling and energy-based path search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. Current bitwise AR models suffer from limited diversity due to the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling and overly sharp logits distributions that cause sampling collapse.

Method: DiverseAR introduces two key components: (1) an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of binary output distributions during sampling to create smoother predictions and greater diversity, and (2) an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens to preserve visual quality despite distribution smoothing.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed DiverseAR method effectively addresses diversity limitations in bitwise AR models through principled solutions for logits distribution adjustment and generation path optimization, achieving better diversity without sacrificing fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Motivation: Previous methods indiscriminately fuse LiDAR and camera data in BEV representation, leading to degraded performance due to geometric accuracy disparities between sensors and spatial misalignment from image depth estimation errors.

Method: Proposes BEVDilation with two key components: 1) Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that densifies foreground voxels using image priors to mitigate point cloud sparsity, and 2) Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block that enhances LiDAR feature diffusion with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture.

Result: On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, and demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion approaches.

Conclusion: The LiDAR-centric fusion strategy with image features as implicit guidance effectively addresses spatial misalignment issues while leveraging image priors to overcome point cloud limitations, resulting in improved 3D object detection performance and robustness.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Conclusion: InEx effectively mitigates hallucination in MLLMs through autonomous multi-agent collaboration combining internal introspection and external verification, inspired by human cognitive processes.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative frameworks for 4D LiDAR world modeling treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking varying uncertainty across real-world scenes, which leads to artifacts in complex/ambiguous regions and limits realism and temporal stability.

Method: U4D first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to identify semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling for high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion for remaining areas under learned structural priors. It incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block to adaptively fuse spatial and temporal representations during diffusion for temporal coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Conclusion: U4D presents an effective uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling that addresses spatial uncertainty variation, improves generation quality in challenging regions, and enhances temporal coherence, making it valuable for autonomous driving and embodied AI applications.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion.

Conclusion: RxBench provides standardized framework revealing LLM capabilities/limitations in prescription review, enabling development of more reliable clinical tools and showing targeted fine-tuning can create specialized models competitive with top general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated their integration into clinical decision support, particularly in prescription review. To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.

TL;DR: CCD is a novel inference framework for Diffusion Language Models that improves generation quality and speed through trajectory rectification using historical context and adaptive sampling budgets based on consistency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLM inference methods rely on local, immediate-step metrics like confidence or entropy, which lack reliable perspective, leading to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality.

Method: Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD) with two core innovations: 1) trajectory rectification using historical context to enhance sequence coherence and reject suboptimal paths early, 2) adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts unmasking budgets per step based on consistency metrics instead of rigid uniform allocations.

Result: Achieves simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

Conclusion: CCD provides a theoretically-grounded framework that improves DLM inference by leveraging historical context for better coherence and adaptive resource allocation, resulting in both faster and higher-quality text generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved significant success due to their any-order generation capabilities. However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs inspired by symmetric/symplectic differential equations, enabling hidden state retrieval during backpropagation without storing activations, significantly reducing memory usage and improving throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM training is expensive and time-consuming, often requiring fine-tuning of pre-trained models. Standard architectures store all intermediate activations, consuming substantial memory and limiting batch sizes and throughput.

Method: Proposed reversible architectures using time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation instead of storing activations. Also developed an efficient method to convert existing non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning.

Result: Results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks across multiple LLMs, with drastic memory reduction enabling larger batch sizes and improved throughput for the same available memory.

Conclusion: The reversible architecture approach provides a scalable and efficient path to reduce memory and computational costs for both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs, making it practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their expensive and time-consuming training. Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models. Our results show comparable or improved performance on several datasets and benchmarks, on several LLMs, building a scalable and efficient path towards reducing the memory and computational costs associated with both training from scratch and fine-tuning of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods for dialect identification, applying them to pre-trained speech models to significantly reduce GPU memory usage and accelerate training while maintaining accuracy comparable to traditional fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialect Identification (DI) is important for improving downstream speech tasks with dialectal variations, but fine-tuning speech models is computationally expensive. Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer parameter efficiency but limited improvements in memory efficiency and training speed.

Method: The authors explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods originally proposed for language processing and apply them to general-purpose pre-trained speech models. They comprehensively analyze GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed across various MEFT methods, using Whisper model fine-tuning on Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset as a case study.

Result: The MEFT approach achieved significant improvements: reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to both vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

Conclusion: MEFT methods provide an effective solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning of speech models for dialect identification, offering substantial reductions in computational resource requirements without sacrificing accuracy, making them practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Dialect Identification (DI) is a task to recognize different dialects within the same language from a speech signal. DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abusive speech on social media constantly evolves with new slang and obfuscated terms that bypass detection systems, requiring adaptive and computationally efficient solutions.

Method: Two-pronged approach: 1) TF-IDF-based sample selection to retain only the most informative 75% of training examples, reducing training overhead; 2) Augmentation of BERT's vocabulary with domain-specific slang and lexical variants from abusive contexts.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on widely used hate speech datasets while significantly improving computational efficiency through reduced training set size.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation by efficiently handling evolving hate speech terminology with reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Abusive speech on social media poses a persistent and evolving challenge, driven by the continuous emergence of novel slang and obfuscated terms designed to circumvent detection systems. In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.

TL;DR: MODOMA is a computational multi-agent system for unsupervised language acquisition experiments where adult and child language models interact, enabling researchers to control parameters and explicitly examine acquired grammatical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible, parameter-controlled computational environment for studying language acquisition through interaction between adult and child agents, allowing explicit representation and examination of acquired grammatical knowledge.

Method: Multi-agent system with adult and child language models using statistical and rule-based procedures for unsupervised language acquisition; fully parameterized with controllable experimental aspects.

Result: The child agent successfully acquired functional and content categories from machine-generated data, showing patterns similar to human language acquisition, validating the MODOMA approach.

Conclusion: MODOMA provides novel possibilities for computational language acquisition experiments by enabling explicit representation of acquired grammatical knowledge and demonstrating successful acquisition of grammatical categories through agent interaction.

Abstract: This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

*Alexander Gurung,Nikolay Malkin,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiteReason is a latent reasoning method that uses a lightweight projector module to generate continuous latent tokens, allowing LLMs to skip reasoning steps and reduce computational cost during RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning optimization with RL has high computational costs, especially for narrative tasks requiring many tokens. There's a need for more efficient methods that maintain performance while reducing reasoning length.

Method: LiteReason uses a Reasoning Projector module trained to produce continuous latent tokens. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed.

Result: Outperforms latent reasoning baselines, comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92% on plot hole detection and book chapter generation tasks.

Conclusion: LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve, offering significant computational savings while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tackle complex tasks by generating long chains of thought or "reasoning traces" that act as latent variables in the generation of an output given a query. A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design is crucial for LLM reasoning performance, but the impact of prompt specificity (how detailed or vague prompts are) remains understudied, creating a gap in understanding optimal prompting strategies.

Method: Developed DETAIL framework: generated multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantified specificity via perplexity measurements, and assessed correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence evaluation. Tested on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini models.

Result: Increased prompt specificity improves LLM accuracy, with more significant benefits for smaller models and procedural tasks. Larger models show less sensitivity to specificity variations.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for adaptive prompting strategies tailored to model size and task type, provides evaluation tools and data for further research, and demonstrates the importance of prompt specificity in optimizing LLM reasoning performance.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a critical role in the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the impact of prompt specificity - how detailed or vague a prompt is - remains understudied. This paper introduces DETAIL, a framework for evaluating LLM performance across varying levels of prompt specificity. We generate multi-level prompts using GPT-4, quantify specificity via perplexity, and assess correctness using GPT-based semantic equivalence. Experiments on 30 novel reasoning tasks across GPT-4 and O3-mini reveal that specificity improves accuracy, especially for smaller models and procedural tasks.

TL;DR: CAIRNS is a framework that helps farmer advisors get credible, readable answers about climate adaptation from web sources without needing model fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate adaptation strategies are crucial for sustainable agriculture, but relevant information exists in both unstructured (scientific literature) and structured (government data) formats that are difficult for farmer advisors to navigate and trust.

Method: CAIRNS uses a structured ScholarGuide prompt to enhance readability and citation reliability, and employs a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts for robust evaluation, all without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

Result: CAIRNS outperforms baselines on most metrics using expert-curated question-answers, with ablation studies confirming results across all metrics, and LLM-based evaluation shows correlation with human judgment.

Conclusion: The CAIRNS framework enables readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering for climate adaptation information, providing farmer advisors with credible preliminary answers from complex web evidence sources.

Abstract: Climate adaptation strategies are proposed in response to climate change. They are practised in agriculture to sustain food production. These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. Using a previously reported dataset of expert-curated question-answers, we show that CAIRNS outperforms the baselines on most of the metrics. Our thorough ablation study confirms the results on all metrics. To validate our LLM-based evaluation, we also report an analysis of correlations against human judgment.

TL;DR: HealthContradict is an expert-verified dataset for evaluating language models' ability to reason over conflicting biomedical contexts, showing that fine-tuned biomedical models can exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models use contextual information to answer health questions and how their responses are impacted by conflicting contexts, particularly in the biomedical domain where accurate information is critical.

Method: Created HealthContradict dataset with 920 unique instances (question, factual answer, two contradictory documents). Tested models in various prompt settings (correct, incorrect, contradictory context) to measure impact on outputs.

Result: HealthContradict provides better distinctions of models' contextual reasoning than existing benchmarks. Fine-tuned biomedical models excel at exploiting correct context while resisting incorrect context, showing both parametric knowledge and contextual reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: The strength of biomedical language models lies in their combination of parametric knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, with HealthContradict serving as an effective benchmark for evaluating these abilities in conflicting information scenarios.

Abstract: How do language models use contextual information to answer health questions? How are their responses impacted by conflicting contexts? We assess the ability of language models to reason over long, conflicting biomedical contexts using HealthContradict, an expert-verified dataset comprising 920 unique instances, each consisting of a health-related question, a factual answer supported by scientific evidence, and two documents presenting contradictory stances. We consider several prompt settings, including correct, incorrect or contradictory context, and measure their impact on model outputs. Compared to existing medical question-answering evaluation benchmarks, HealthContradict provides greater distinctions of language models' contextual reasoning capabilities. Our experiments show that the strength of fine-tuned biomedical language models lies not only in their parametric knowledge from pretraining, but also in their ability to exploit correct context while resisting incorrect context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically studies how LLMs act as both problem solvers and verifiers, examining self-verification vs. cross-family verification across 37 models on 9 benchmarks, introducing verifier gain metric to predict performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies of solver-verifier interactions in LLMs have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification without examining cross-family verification or the effects of extensive post-training on verification capabilities.

Method: Conducted systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering diverse reasoning tasks. Introduced and validated verifier gain metric to predict performance improvements from verifier-based rejection sampling.

Result: Cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability. Verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive insights into solver-verifier interactions, demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-family verification and characterizing how verification capabilities scale with model characteristics and task types.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.

*Francesco Paolo Savatteri,Chahan Vidal-Gorène,Florian Cafiero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Textual embeddings (RoBERTa) outperform numeric features for fake-news detection, while numeric-only approaches remain viable when compute is limited. Virality prediction is harder than fake-news detection and highly sensitive to label construction, with non-linear methods (t-SNE) working better than linear ones (PCA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate practical approaches for online misinformation tasks (fake-news detection and virality prediction) in operational settings requiring rapid reaction, comparing text-based vs. lightweight numeric methods under realistic constraints.

Method: Used EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets to compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa, Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). Employed median-based viral split (<50 likes) and analyzed dimensionality reduction (PCA vs t-SNE).

Result: Textual content alone is strong for fake-news detection; numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable. Virality prediction is markedly harder and highly sensitive to label construction. Non-linear structure (t-SNE) is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection. Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral yields only modest differences.

Conclusion: Text-based approaches excel for fake-news detection, while numeric methods offer practical alternatives under constraints. Virality prediction requires careful label construction and benefits from non-linear analysis. Evaluation design and reproducibility constraints significantly impact real-world deployment.

Abstract: We present an evaluation-driven study of two practical tasks regarding online misinformation: (i) fake-news detection and (ii) virality prediction in the context of operational settings, with the necessity for rapid reaction. Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.

*Zheng Fang,Donghao Xie,Ming Pang,Chunyuan Yuan,Xue Jiang,Changping Peng,Zhangang Lin,Zheng Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADORE is a self-sustaining framework for e-commerce search relevance that combines LLM-generated training data with adversarial hardening and knowledge distillation to overcome data scarcity and semantic gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current e-commerce search relevance modeling faces challenges with semantic gaps in term-matching methods and neural models' reliance on scarce domain-specific hard samples.

Method: ADORE integrates three innovations: 1) Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination using Chain-of-Thought LLM with Kahneman-Tversky Optimization, 2) Error-type-aware Data Synthesis for adversarial examples, and 3) Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation with domain-specific attribute hierarchies.

Result: Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE in improving relevance modeling.

Conclusion: ADORE establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial e-commerce applications by automating annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation.

Abstract: Relevance modeling in e-commerce search remains challenged by semantic gaps in term-matching methods (e.g., BM25) and neural models' reliance on the scarcity of domain-specific hard samples. We propose ADORE, a self-sustaining framework that synergizes three innovations: (1) A Rule-aware Relevance Discrimination module, where a Chain-of-Thought LLM generates intent-aligned training data, refined via Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to align with user behavior; (2) An Error-type-aware Data Synthesis module that auto-generates adversarial examples to harden robustness; and (3) A Key-attribute-enhanced Knowledge Distillation module that injects domain-specific attribute hierarchies into a deployable student model. ADORE automates annotation, adversarial generation, and distillation, overcoming data scarcity while enhancing reasoning. Large-scale experiments and online A/B testing verify the effectiveness of ADORE. The framework establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient, cognitively aligned relevance modeling in industrial applications.

### [124] [From Imitation to Discrimination: Toward A Generalized Curriculum Advantage Mechanism Enhancing Cross-Domain Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02580)
*Changpeng Yang,Jinyang Wu,Yuchen Liu,Shuai Zhang,Yang Li,Qiliang Liang,Hongzhen Wang,Shuai Nie,Jiaming Xu,Runyu Shi,Ying Huang,Guoquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPO is a curriculum learning method for RL-based LLM optimization that separates positive and negative advantage signals, starting with positive-only training before gradually introducing negative samples for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for LLMs mix positive and negative advantage signals from the start, causing ambiguous guidance and limited performance gains, especially in early training stages.

Method: CAPO uses an adaptive curriculum: first bootstraps imitation learning with only positive advantage samples to build robust foundations, then gradually introduces negative signals to develop discriminative capabilities.

Result: The method achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks and generalizes effectively to multimodal GUI reasoning scenarios, working with various optimization methods (GRPO, PPO, RLOO, Reinforce++).

Conclusion: CAPO provides a versatile and robust optimization framework that addresses the limitations of indiscriminate signal mixing in RL-based LLM training through curriculum learning based on advantage signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a paradigm for post-training large language models, boosting their reasoning capabilities. Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training. However, the indiscriminate mixing of the two signals in existing methods, especially from the early stages, may lead to ambiguous guidance and limited gains. To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios. Compatible with diverse optimization methods including GRPO, PPO, RLOO, and Reinforce++, our method consistently achieves stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks, and further generalizes effectively to multimodal Graphical User Interface (GUI) reasoning scenarios, establishing itself as a versatile and robust optimization framework.

### [126] [Input Order Shapes LLM Semantic Alignment in Multi-Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02665)
*Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show a primacy effect in multi-document summarization, favoring the first article in input order regardless of stance, posing risks for neutral overview applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs weight all input documents equally in multi-document summarization tasks, particularly for controversial topics like abortion, given their increasing use in applications like Google's AI Overviews.

Method: Constructed 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets on abortion, permuted each into six input orders, prompted Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate neutral overviews, and evaluated summaries using ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and SummaC metrics with statistical analysis.

Result: Found significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, with summaries more semantically aligned with first-seen article. Position 1 differed significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while latter two showed no difference, confirming selective preference for first document.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit systematic bias toward first input documents in multi-document summarization, presenting risks for applications relying on neutral overviews and agentic AI systems where LLM outputs disproportionately influence downstream decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in settings such as Google's AI Overviews, where it summarizes multiple long documents. However, it remains unclear whether they weight all inputs equally. Focusing on abortion-related news, we construct 40 pro-neutral-con article triplets, permute each triplet into six input orders, and prompt Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a neutral overview. We evaluate each summary against its source articles using ROUGE-L (lexical overlap), BERTScore (semantic similarity), and SummaC (factual consistency). One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document. The findings present risks for applications that rely on LLM-generated overviews and for agentic AI systems, where the steps involving LLMs can disproportionately influence downstream actions.

### [127] [An Empirical Survey of Model Merging Algorithms for Social Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02689)
*Daiki Shirafuji,Tatsuhiko Saito,Yasutomo Kimura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Empirical comparison of 7 model merging algorithms for bias mitigation in LLMs shows trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance, with SLERP emerging as most balanced approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs inherit and amplify societal biases from training data, threatening fairness. While model merging approaches have been explored for bias mitigation, there's no empirical comparison of different algorithms.

Method: Surveyed 7 model merging algorithms (Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, Nearswap) applied to 13 open-weight models from GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. Comprehensive evaluation using 3 bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, HONEST) and downstream performance on SuperGLUE benchmark.

Result: Found trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, especially on reading comprehension, commonsense, and causal reasoning tasks. Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as most balanced choice.

Conclusion: Model merging algorithms show potential for bias mitigation, but excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods can degrade important linguistic abilities. SLERP with moderate weights offers best balance between bias reduction and performance preservation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to inherit and even amplify societal biases present in their pre-training corpora, threatening fairness and social trust. To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST is a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters, using cross-lingual transfer from 13 high-resource languages to generalize effectively to both high-resource and low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety guardrails for LLMs are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving low-resource language speakers underrepresented. There's a need for universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale to serve global populations.

Method: CREST uses cluster-based cross-lingual transfer, training on a strategically chosen subset of 13 high-resource languages to support 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. This parameter-efficient approach addresses limited training data in low-resource settings.

Result: CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above) across six safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

Abstract: Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.

### [129] [Emergent Bayesian Behaviour and Optimal Cue Combination in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02719)
*Julian Ma,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show emergent Bayesian-like integration of multimodal cues without explicit training, but accuracy doesn't guarantee robust uncertainty handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs exhibit implicit Bayesian computational strategies for multimodal integration similar to humans, despite being trained for explicit reasoning tasks.

Method: Created BayesBench - a psychophysics-inspired benchmark with 4 magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, duration) across text and image modalities. Evaluated 9 LLMs with controlled ablations of noise, context, and instructions, measuring performance, behavior, and efficiency in multimodal cue combination. Introduced Bayesian Consistency Score to detect Bayes-consistent behavioral shifts beyond accuracy metrics.

Result: While capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy doesn't guarantee robustness. GPT-5 Mini achieved perfect text accuracy but failed to integrate visual cues efficiently, revealing dissociation between capability and strategy. Emergent principled uncertainty handling was observed, with correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies.

Conclusion: Accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. The findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty in LLMs and highlight the need for evaluation tools that assess computational strategies beyond just accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at explicit reasoning, but their implicit computational strategies remain underexplored. Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies. We release our psychophysics benchmark and consistency metric (https://bayes-bench.github.io) as evaluation tools and to inform future multimodal architecture designs.

*Jiahao Zhao,Shuaixing Zhang,Nan Xu,Lei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurveyEval is a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based automatic survey generation systems across quality, coherence, and accuracy dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of comprehensive evaluation methods for complex LLM-based automatic survey systems that integrate retrieval, organization, and content synthesis.

Method: Created SurveyEval benchmark evaluating surveys across 3 dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy; extended across 7 subjects; augmented LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references.

Result: Specialized survey-generation systems produce substantially higher-quality results than general long-text or paper-writing systems.

Conclusion: SurveyEval serves as a scalable testbed for understanding and improving automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

Abstract: LLM-based automatic survey systems are transforming how users acquire information from the web by integrating retrieval, organization, and content synthesis into end-to-end generation pipelines. While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results. We envision SurveyEval as a scalable testbed to understand and improve automatic survey systems across diverse subjects and evaluation criteria.

*Robert Belanec,Ivan Srba,Maria Bielikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEFT-Factory is a unified framework for efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models that improves replicability and benchmarking of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of LLMs makes full fine-tuning impractical, and many new PEFT methods are difficult to replicate, deploy, or compare with each other, creating a need for a standardized framework.

Method: PEFT-Factory provides a modular framework with 19 PEFT methods, 27 datasets covering 12 tasks, and both standard and PEFT-specific evaluation metrics, built on top of LLaMA-Factory.

Result: The framework creates a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment that improves replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods.

Conclusion: PEFT-Factory addresses the challenges in PEFT method comparison and deployment by providing a unified framework that supports extensibility while offering comprehensive benchmarking capabilities.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address the increasing size of Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, many newly introduced PEFT methods are challenging to replicate, deploy, or compare with one another. To address this, we introduce PEFT-Factory, a unified framework for efficient fine-tuning LLMs using both off-the-shelf and custom PEFT methods. While its modular design supports extensibility, it natively provides a representative set of 19 PEFT methods, 27 classification and text generation datasets addressing 12 tasks, and both standard and PEFT-specific evaluation metrics. As a result, PEFT-Factory provides a ready-to-use, controlled, and stable environment, improving replicability and benchmarking of PEFT methods. PEFT-Factory is a downstream framework that originates from the popular LLaMA-Factory, and is publicly available at https://github.com/kinit-sk/PEFT-Factory

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniFact introduces a unified evaluation framework to bridge the research divide between model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV) in LLMs, showing that hybrid approaches combining both methods achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs frequently generate factually incorrect content (hallucinations), undermining trust and adoption. Two research paradigms (HD and FV) have evolved in isolation with distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols, creating a research schism that hinders collective progress.

Method: Introduces UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Conducts large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods.

Result: Three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; (3) Hybrid approaches integrating both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Provides first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged.

Conclusion: The comprehensive results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs. All code, data, and baseline implementations are open-sourced.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit hallucinations, generating content that appears fluent and coherent but is factually incorrect. Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.

*Juexi Shao,Siyou Li,Yujian Gan,Chris Madge,Vanja Karan,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A three-tier data synthesis method improves dialogue-based generalized referring expression comprehension by generating scalable supervision that balances realism and controllability, leading to consistent performance gains across evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue-based GREC systems struggle with distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, and there's a scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data, creating a need for scalable supervision methods.

Method: A three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding.

Result: Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed data synthesis approach effectively addresses the challenges of distribution shift and data scarcity in dialogue-based GREC, enabling better performance through scalable supervision.

Abstract: Dialogue-Based Generalized Referring Expressions Comprehension (GREC) requires models to ground the expression and unlimited targets in complex visual scenes while resolving coreference across a long dialogue context. However, existing systems struggle under distribution shift between training and evaluation domains, a gap exacerbated by the scarcity of annotated dialogue grounding data. We address this challenge with a three-tier data-synthesis method that balances realism and controllability to produce scalable supervision for dialogue-conditioned grounding. Fine-tuning on the synthesized data yields consistent, substantial improvements over prior approaches across standard evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: TriLex framework expands sentiment lexicons for low-resource African languages using corpus extraction, cross-lingual mapping, and RAG refinement, improving sentiment analysis performance of African PLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource African languages are underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting lexical coverage and performance of multilingual NLP systems, creating a need for systematic lexicon expansion methods.

Method: TriLex: three-stage retrieval augmented framework combining corpus-based extraction, cross-lingual mapping, and RAG-driven lexical refinement to expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages.

Result: AfroXLMR achieved F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu with strong cross-lingual stability; AfriBERTa achieved ~64% F1 despite no pre-training on target languages; both outperformed traditional ML baselines.

Conclusion: TriLex is a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages, with AfroXLMR showing superior performance.

Abstract: Low-resource African languages remain underrepresented in sentiment analysis, limiting both lexical coverage and the performance of multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings. Both models outperform traditional machine learning baselines, and ensemble analyses further enhance precision and robustness. The findings establish TriLex as a scalable and effective framework for multilingual sentiment lexicon expansion and sentiment modeling in low-resource South African languages.

*Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes stable rank, an intrinsic quality signal derived from LLM representations that measures effective dimensionality, and uses it for alignment without external supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods face limitations: human annotations are scarce/subjective, reward models are vulnerable to hacking, and self-evaluation suffers from prompt sensitivity and biases. There's a need for scalable alignment without external supervision.

Method: 1) Stable rank: computes ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance to measure effective dimensionality of hidden states. 2) SR-GRPO: uses stable rank as reward signal for reinforcement learning (Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization).

Result: Stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by 11.3 percentage points via Best-of-N sampling. SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

Conclusion: Quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision. Stable rank provides an intrinsic, annotation-free approach to LLM alignment.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on external supervision, which faces critical limitations: human annotations are scarce and subjective, reward models are vulnerable to reward hacking, and self-evaluation methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and biases. In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines. Our findings demonstrate that quality signals can be extracted from internal model geometry, offering a path toward scalable alignment without external supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's an urgent need to assess LLMs' clinical application capabilities in TCM, but existing benchmarks are limited to knowledge-based QA or syndrome differentiation accuracy, often neglecting treatment decision-making evaluation.

Conclusion: TCM-BEST4SDT addresses critical gaps in LLM evaluation for TCM clinical applications by providing a comprehensive, expert-led benchmark that assesses treatment decision-making capabilities alongside knowledge and ethical considerations, advancing the development of intelligent TCM systems.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) domain presents an urgent need to assess their clinical application capabilities. However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's "Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.

Motivation: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have created a critical need for localizing educational content. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal (audio + slides), requiring systems that can process multiple input modalities to provide accessible and complete learning experiences.

Method: BOOM uses an end-to-end approach that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech.

Conclusion: BOOM provides a comprehensive multimodal multilingual solution for lecture translation that preserves all original modalities (text, slides, speech) and offers additional benefits for educational applications through slide-aware processing.

Abstract: The globalization of education and rapid growth of online learning have made localizing educational content a critical challenge. Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: System prompt optimization improves multilingual LLM performance by 5-10% through structured prompts that reduce language-switching and enhance reasoning consistency across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM deployments need single system prompts that work reliably across multiple languages, but prior work focused only on English settings, leaving multilingual prompt optimization unexplored.

Method: Proposed a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework for multilingual prompts, conducted large-scale experiments across 5 languages, 3 LLMs, and 3 benchmarks, developed a prompt optimization framework, and analyzed over 10 million reasoning units.

Result: Certain prompt components (CoT, emotion, scenario) correlate with robust multilingual behavior; optimized prompts improve all metrics by 5-10%; better prompts induce more structured reasoning patterns and reduce unnecessary language-switching.

Conclusion: System prompt optimization provides a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior, with optimized prompts enhancing cross-lingual performance through more consistent reasoning patterns.

Abstract: System prompts provide a lightweight yet powerful mechanism for conditioning large language models (LLMs) at inference time. While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using interactive visual knowledge graphs to help users identify and correct LLM hallucinations by linking model assertions to underlying sources with confidence indicators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs augmented with enterprise domain knowledge often produce credible-seeming hallucinations due to limited context windows and knowledge inconsistencies, with current mitigation strategies being costly or unreliable.

Method: Organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs that link model assertions to truth sources with confidence levels, enabling users to diagnose inconsistencies and provide feedback.

Result: Provides a clear visual interface for users to identify hallucination zones, weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback, creating a structured human-in-the-loop workflow.

Conclusion: The visual knowledge graph framework enhances model reliability and enables continuous improvement of response quality through structured human feedback loops.

Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses hate speech detection in low-resource Bangla language using transformer models, finding that BanglaBERT outperforms other models including m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, demonstrating the importance of language-specific pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hate speech recognition in low-resource languages like Bangla is challenging due to insufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Despite being spoken by over 230 million people, Bangla is underrepresented in computational resources for automated moderation on social media platforms.

Method: The study reproduces official baselines (Majority, Random, SVM) and adds Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree as baseline methods. Transformer-based models including DistilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM-RoBERTa are used for hate speech classification on BLP 2025 Shared Task Subtasks 1A and 1B.

Result: All transformer-based models outperformed baseline methods except for DistilBERT. Among transformers, BanglaBERT produced the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperformed both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa.

Conclusion: Language-specific pre-training is crucial for hate speech detection in low-resource languages. The results highlight the potential and need for pre-trained language models for Bangla, demonstrating that specialized models can outperform larger multilingual models.

Abstract: Hate speech recognition in low-resource lan- guages remains a difficult problem due to in- sufficient datasets, orthographic heterogeneity, and linguistic variety. Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language- specific pre-training is very important. Our results highlight the potential and need for pre- trained language models for the low-resource Bangla language.

*Haonan Wang,Chao Du,Kenji Kawaguchi,Tianyu Pang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkMerge is a training-free decoding strategy that averages next-token logits from parallel reasoning traces at synchronization points, enabling parallel test-time scaling for open-ended reasoning tasks without relying on majority voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Majority voting works well for close-ended QA but fails for open-ended reasoning tasks like code generation and web research where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. There's a need for methods that can leverage parallel reasoning traces for open-ended tasks.

Method: ThinkMerge runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. It integrates with vLLM/SGLang, remains compatible with standard decoding techniques, and doesn't require training.

Result: ThinkMerge matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, improves pass@1 by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench (hard), and enhances web-based deep-research agents across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch.

Conclusion: Parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs. ThinkMerge provides consistent gains across diverse open-ended tasks including code generation and web-based research.

Abstract: Majority voting has proven effective for close-ended question answering by aggregating parallel reasoning traces. However, it is not directly applicable to open-ended reasoning, such as code generation and web-based deep research, where a "majority" over complete solutions is ill-defined. We introduce ThinkMerge, a training-free, plug-and-play decoding strategy that runs K parallel reasoning traces and averages their next-token logits at synchronization points to produce a single coherent output. ThinkMerge integrates seamlessly with vLLM/SGLang and remains compatible with standard decoding techniques such as Top-p/Top-k. Empirically, it matches or surpasses majority voting on AIME and GPQA, while delivering consistent gains on open-ended coding tasks: on LiveCodeBench (hard), pass@1 improves by +8.28% for DeepCoder-14B-Preview and +7.58% for Qwen3-8B. Beyond code, we further show that ThinkMerge improves web-based deep-research agents (e.g., WebSailor-7B/32B) across GAIA, BrowseComp-en/zh, and XbenchDeepSearch. These results demonstrate that parallel test-time scaling can benefit open-ended reasoning without relying on voting over complete outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SchED is a training-free early-exit algorithm for diffusion LLMs that accelerates decoding by 3.8-4.0× while maintaining 99.8-100% performance, outperforming prior confidence-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer promising alternatives to autoregressive models but suffer from slow, iterative sampling that hampers their practical utility.

Method: SchED is a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met.

Result: On instruction-tuned models, SchED achieves 3.8-4.0× speedups while retaining 99.8-100% of baseline scores. On base models, it yields consistent speedup gains with 99.1-100% performance retention, with up to 2.34× under aggressive settings. It outperforms prior confidence-based methods, especially on long-form generation.

Conclusion: SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient by turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, with analysis showing instruction tuning speeds up predictive entropy decay.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models, but their practical utility is severely hampered by slow, iterative sampling. We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $γ{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for translating English sentences to CNF logic using NLP techniques and fine-tuned LLMs to reduce hallucinations in logical translation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated reasoning and software verification by translating natural language to formal logic, addressing the challenge of LLM hallucinations in precision-critical logical translation tasks.

Method: Combines classical NLP with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and fine-tuned language models to convert English sentences to logical expressions and then to CNF for satisfiability solving.

Result: The fine-tuned model trained on different grammar settings can intentionally correct hallucinations made by the original model, providing reliable CNF generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully reduces hallucinations in logical translation, enabling more reliable automated reasoning and software verification through formal logic translation.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoCoP is a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating moral consistency in LLMs through autonomous scenario generation and multi-layer analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment frameworks rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning evolves across contexts and time, highlighting the need for dynamic moral consistency assessment.

Method: MoCoP combines three layers: lexical integrity analysis, semantic risk estimation, and reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision.

Result: Empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek show strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (rET = -0.81, p<0.001) and near-zero association with response latency (rEL ≈ 0), revealing moral coherence as stable characteristic.

Conclusion: MoCoP provides a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances computational morality by reframing ethical evaluation as dynamic, model-agnostic moral introspection in autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.

### [146] [The 4/$δ$ Bound: Designing Predictable LLM-Verifier Systems for Formal Method Guarantee](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02080)
*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem providing provable guarantees for termination and convergence in LLM-assisted formal verification, with empirical validation across 90,000+ trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-assisted formal verification methods are unreliable without solid theoretical foundations, causing refinement processes to wander, loop, or break from stable trajectories, creating uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Method: Developed an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem modeling the interaction as a discrete-time Markov Chain with error-reduction probability (δ) parameter. Conducted extensive empirical testing with 90,000+ trials to validate theoretical predictions.

Result: Proved termination for any δ>0 with expected iteration count bounded by 𝔼[n] ≤ 4/δ. Empirical results showed 100% verification success across all trials, with convergence factor Cf≈1.0, establishing three operating zones (marginal, practical, high-performance).

Conclusion: The theoretical guarantee and experimental evidence provide a solid architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification, enabling predictable resource planning and performance budgeting for safety-critical software deployment without heuristic tuning.

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

TL;DR: Flowchart2Mermaid converts static flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code using vision-language models, with interactive refinement features and evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flowcharts are commonly shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused, creating barriers to collaboration and modification.

Method: A lightweight web system using vision-language models with detailed system prompts to convert flowchart images to Mermaid.js code, featuring mixed-initiative refinement through text editing, drag-and-drop, and natural-language AI assistant commands.

Result: Produces structured, version-controllable textual representations synchronized with rendered diagrams, with introduced evaluation metrics for structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across models.

Conclusion: The system enables conversion of static flowcharts into editable, maintainable textual representations with interactive refinement capabilities, addressing limitations of prior image-to-diagram tools.

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

*Alexander Boyd,Franz Nowak,David Hyland,Manuel Baltieri,Fernando E. Rosas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for decomposing complex world models (transducers) into modular subcomponents for parallelizable and interpretable distributed inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are computationally demanding but real-world scenarios often involve modular interactions, suggesting efficiency gains through decomposition. Need to bridge AI safety's structural transparency requirements with computational efficiency for real-world inference.

Method: Develop a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers (generalizing POMDPs). Invert the composition process to derive sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces.

Result: Enables parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that support distributed inference. Provides groundwork for combining structural transparency with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The decomposition framework for transducers offers a path toward efficient, interpretable world models that balance AI safety requirements with practical computational needs for real-world deployment.

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRIDE is a framework that helps decide when to use autonomous AI agents vs simpler LLM approaches, reducing unnecessary agent deployments by 45% and cutting costs by 37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid shift from stateless LLMs to autonomous agents raises questions about when agentic AI is truly necessary, as indiscriminate deployment leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.

Method: STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, recommending between direct LLM calls, guided AI assistants, or fully autonomous agentic AI.

Result: Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months confirmed practical utility.

Conclusion: This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs, distinguishing between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy.

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

*Rory Milsom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment to test if general LLM agents can accurately and economically complete wealth-management tasks, creating a benchmark of 12 task-pairs with acceptance criteria and deterministic graders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite numerous digital collaboration tools, routine financial processes still suffer from human error and delays. The research aims to address this gap by investigating whether general-purpose LLM agents can effectively handle wealth-management tasks, creating a meaningful evaluation framework for assistant-level financial work.

Method: The study extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment, introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. It constructs a benchmark of 12 task-pairs spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication tasks, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. The research includes both high and low-autonomy variants for each task.

Result: The study found that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more by end-to-end workflow reliability. Performance was meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and incorrect evaluation of models has hindered benchmarking in this domain.

Conclusion: General-purpose LLM agents show promise for wealth-management tasks but face challenges with workflow reliability rather than mathematical reasoning. The autonomy level significantly impacts performance, and proper evaluation frameworks are crucial for meaningful benchmarking in financial domains.

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

### [151] [TradeTrap: Are LLM-based Trading Agents Truly Reliable and Faithful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02261)
*Lewen Yan,Jilin Mei,Tianyi Zhou,Lige Huang,Jie Zhang,Dongrui Liu,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TradeTrap is a framework for stress-testing autonomous trading agents by introducing controlled perturbations to their core components, revealing that small system-level issues can cause catastrophic financial losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly used in real financial markets, but their reliability under adversarial or faulty conditions remains largely unexamined despite operating in high-risk environments where mistakes are irreversible.

Method: TradeTrap systematically stress-tests both adaptive and procedural trading agents by targeting four core components: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio/ledger handling, and trade execution. It evaluates robustness under controlled system-level perturbations in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting using real US equity market data with identical initial conditions.

Result: Small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

Conclusion: Current autonomous trading agents are vulnerable to systematic manipulation at the system level, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation frameworks like TradeTrap to ensure reliability in real-world financial applications.

Abstract: LLM-based trading agents are increasingly deployed in real-world financial markets to perform autonomous analysis and execution. However, their reliability and robustness under adversarial or faulty conditions remain largely unexamined, despite operating in high-risk, irreversible financial environments. We propose TradeTrap, a unified evaluation framework for systematically stress-testing both adaptive and procedural autonomous trading agents. TradeTrap targets four core components of autonomous trading agents: market intelligence, strategy formulation, portfolio and ledger handling, and trade execution, and evaluates their robustness under controlled system-level perturbations. All evaluations are conducted in a closed-loop historical backtesting setting on real US equity market data with identical initial conditions, enabling fair and reproducible comparisons across agents and attacks. Extensive experiments show that small perturbations at a single component can propagate through the agent decision loop and induce extreme concentration, runaway exposure, and large portfolio drawdowns across both agent types, demonstrating that current autonomous trading agents can be systematically misled at the system level.

*Noorbakhsh Amiri Golilarz,Sindhuja Penchala,Shahram Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies seven core deficiencies in current AI systems that prevent robust generalization and autonomy, and proposes a shift toward cognitively-grounded AI architectures with self-monitoring, adaptive learning, and goal restructuring capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid AI advances in perception, language, and reasoning, current systems lack fundamental capabilities for self-monitoring, self-correction, and autonomous behavior regulation in dynamic contexts. The paper aims to identify structural limitations preventing robust generalization and lifelong adaptability.

Method: The paper conducts a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition, integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience. It identifies seven core deficiencies through this interdisciplinary approach and outlines how these limitations manifest in current architectures.

Result: Identifies seven key deficiencies: absence of intrinsic self-monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed non-adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and absence of intrinsic agency. These limitations prevent current AI from achieving robust generalization and autonomy.

Conclusion: Advocates for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) with self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional goal-oriented behavior. Calls for reformative oversight mechanisms to ensure interpretability, governability, and alignment with human values.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

*Han Luo,Guy Laban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DialogGuard is a multi-agent framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM responses across five dimensions: privacy violations, discrimination, manipulation, psychological harm, and insults, using LLM-as-a-judge pipelines to improve safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in mental health, crisis, and emotionally sensitive services, but their psychosocial safety remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated, creating risks for vulnerable users.

Method: Multi-agent framework with four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines (single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, stochastic majority voting) using a shared three-level rubric. Evaluated on PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with human safety annotations.

Result: Multi-agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging. Dual-agent correction and majority voting provide best trade-off between accuracy, human alignment, and robustness. Debate achieves higher recall but over-flags borderline cases.

Conclusion: DialogGuard provides an effective open-source framework for assessing psychosocial risks in LLMs, supporting prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users through explainable risk scores and rationales.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now mediate many web-based mental- health, crisis, and other emotionally sensitive services, yet their psychosocial safety in these settings remains poorly understood and weakly evaluated. We present DialogGuard, a multi-agent frame- work for assessing psychosocial risks in LLM-generated responses along five high-severity dimensions: privacy violations, discrimi- natory behaviour, mental manipulation, psychological harm, and insulting behaviour. DialogGuard can be applied to diverse gen- erative models through four LLM-as-a-judge pipelines, including single-agent scoring, dual-agent correction, multi-agent debate, and stochastic majority voting, grounded in a shared three-level rubric usable by both human annotators and LLM judges. Using PKU-SafeRLHF with human safety annotations, we show that multi- agent mechanisms detect psychosocial risks more accurately than non-LLM baselines and single-agent judging; dual-agent correction and majority voting provide the best trade-off between accuracy, alignment with human ratings, and robustness, while debate attains higher recall but over-flags borderline cases. We release Dialog- Guard as open-source software with a web interface that provides per-dimension risk scores and explainable natural-language ratio- nales. A formative study with 12 practitioners illustrates how it supports prompt design, auditing, and supervision of web-facing applications for vulnerable users.

TL;DR: MERINDA is an FPGA-accelerated Model Recovery framework that replaces iterative NODE solvers with parallelizable neural architecture, achieving 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime than mobile GPUs for real-time mission-critical autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Recovery enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems but faces deployment challenges on edge devices due to inefficient iterative neural ODE solvers on FPGAs, with memory and energy consumption being major concerns for real-time operation.

Method: MERINDA replaces iterative neural ODE solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs, specifically designed for FPGA acceleration to overcome the inefficiency of iterative computations on FPGAs.

Result: Achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs, with experiments revealing an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy.

Conclusion: MERINDA demonstrates suitability for resource-constrained, real-time mission-critical autonomous systems by providing efficient FPGA-accelerated Model Recovery with significant memory and speed improvements.

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

*Varun Kumar Dasoju,Qingsu Cheng,Zeyun Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Achieves 95.5% Dice score for breast cell segmentation using only 599 training images despite severe class imbalance (0.1%-20% breast tissue), through quantum-inspired edge enhancement, stabilized loss functions, and weighted sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation requires significant expert time and expertise, creating a bottleneck for clinical AI development. The paper aims to reduce annotation burden while maintaining high segmentation accuracy for breast cell images with severe class imbalance.

Method: Uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters (4th channel), stabilized multi-component loss (adaptive Dice + boundary-aware terms), complexity-based weighted sampling, EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with 4-to-3 channel projection, and robust validation with exponential moving averaging.

Result: Achieves 95.5% Dice score (+/- 0.3%) and 91.2% IoU (+/- 0.4%). Quantum enhancement improves boundary accuracy by 2.1%, weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%, using only 599 training images with severe class imbalance.

Conclusion: The framework significantly reduces medical expert annotation time while achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical AI development for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniGuard is a family of omni-modal guardrails for Large Language Models that processes text, images, videos, and audio with reasoning ability, trained on a comprehensive 210K+ multimodal safety dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior safety guardrails are limited to unimodal settings and use binary classification, lacking robustness across diverse modalities and tasks in omni-modal LLMs.

Method: Proposes OmniGuard with deliberate reasoning ability across all modalities, trained on a curated omni-modal safety dataset with 210K+ diverse samples annotated with structured safety labels and expert model critiques.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show strong effectiveness and generalization across wide range of multimodal safety scenarios, providing unified framework for policy enforcement and risk mitigation.

Conclusion: OmniGuard enables robust safeguarding for omni-modal LLMs, paving the way for more capable omnimodal safety systems that handle diverse modalities through unified reasoning framework.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMindView-Bench is a new benchmark that isolates multi-view spatial reasoning from single-view perception to evaluate VLMs' ability to construct and maintain spatial mental models across viewpoints, revealing consistent failures in cross-view alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with geometric coherence and cross-view consistency in spatial reasoning, lacking benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors.

Method: Created ReMindView-Bench with systematic variation of viewpoint spatial patterns and query types to probe spatial cognition factors. Evaluated 15 VLMs using explicit phase-wise analysis (LLM-as-a-judge, self-consistency) and implicit analysis (linear probing, entropy dynamics).

Result: VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Analysis shows progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct/incorrect reasoning trajectories.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning, revealing how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases, highlighting fundamental limitations in cross-view alignment.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

TL;DR: LLM-powered generative agent simulation system for MMO game optimization, using fine-tuned language models to mimic real player behavior and enable cost-effective numerical design testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MMO optimization methods are costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to player experience, while simplified offline simulations lack fidelity to accurately model player reasoning and reactions to game interventions.

Method: Proposes a generative agent-based MMO simulation using LLMs fine-tuned with SFT and RL on real player data, combined with a data-driven environment model trained on gameplay logs to create realistic player decision-making and dynamic game systems.

Result: Experiments show strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable and interpretable framework for optimization.

Conclusion: The LLM-powered simulation system offers a cost-efficient, interpretable, and data-driven framework for MMO numerical design optimization that avoids disrupting real player experience.

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

*David X. Wu,Shreyas Kapur,Anant Sahai,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Supervised learning with synthetic error injection fails to effectively teach language models self-correction, unlike on-policy reinforcement learning which works better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a computationally cheaper alternative to reinforcement learning for teaching language models self-correction abilities, inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Inject artificial errors into reasoning chains, mask them, and supervise models to recognize and correct these synthetic mistakes through fine-tuning.

Result: The approach fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Models often parrot original mistakes even when catching errors. Distribution shift from synthetic to on-policy errors degrades correction capabilities despite good synthetic coverage.

Conclusion: Synthetic error injection is ineffective for teaching self-correction, explaining why on-policy reinforcement learning remains uniquely effective for this task.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI agent pipeline identifies hidden relationships between prediction markets and uses them to create profitable trading strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction markets suffer from fragmentation with overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across different markets, making it difficult to identify relationships between them.

Method: An agentic AI pipeline that autonomously clusters markets into topical groups using natural-language understanding, then identifies market pairs with strong outcome dependencies (correlated or anti-correlated) within clusters.

Result: Agent-identified relationships achieve 60-70% accuracy, and trading strategies based on these relationships earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons on Polymarket data.

Conclusion: Agentic AI and large language models can effectively uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets, translating discovered relationships into actionable trading signals with significant profitability.

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

TL;DR: R-Few introduces a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight to enable stable AI self-evolution, achieving consistent improvements on math and reasoning benchmarks with minimal human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI self-evolution systems often plateau or degrade due to issues like concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, where models reinforce their own biases. There's a need for stable, controllable self-evolution with minimal human supervision.

Method: R-Few uses a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework with lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. The Challenger samples human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples using an online, difficulty-based curriculum.

Result: R-Few achieves consistent iterative improvements across math and general reasoning benchmarks. Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and matches General-Reasoner performance despite using 20x less human data. The framework mitigates drift and yields stable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Conclusion: R-Few demonstrates that guided self-play with lightweight human oversight enables stable and controllable AI self-evolution, achieving strong performance improvements with minimal human supervision while addressing key challenges like concept drift and diversity collapse.

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COPE is a Chain-of-Thought enhanced LLM framework that predicts 90-day functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke from unstructured clinical notes with accuracy comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to other baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich contextual information for stroke outcome prediction but their unstructured nature limits use in traditional predictive models. There's a need for accurate, interpretable, and privacy-preserving solutions that can leverage this unstructured data.

Method: Developed COPE, a two-step Chain-of-Thought framework using sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models. First model generates clinical reasoning, second outputs mRS prediction. Compared with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, structured variable-based ML model, and single-step LLM without CoT on 464 AIS patients.

Result: COPE achieved MAE of 1.01, +/-1 accuracy of 74.4%, exact accuracy of 32.8%, comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to other baselines. Consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error in older patients, thrombectomy cases, and longer summaries.

Conclusion: COPE provides an accurate, lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source solution for stroke outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text, demonstrating the value of reasoning-enhanced LLM frameworks in clinical applications.

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Method: A multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration, employing five core agents with dynamic debate mechanisms and RAG-based knowledge retrieval.

Result: Aetheria generates detailed and traceable audit reports and demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in identifying implicit risks.

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal empathy prediction method using video, audio, and text with supervisory document-assisted training to improve text feature extraction using privileged information only available during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing empathy prediction methods focus on single modalities (typically text) and fail to leverage multi-modal processing capabilities and privileged information that could contain additional empathetic content.

Method: Multi-modal empathy prediction network using pre-trained networks to extract features from video, audio, and text, followed by cross-modal fusion. Includes supervisory document-assisted training using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify topic distributions that constrain text features, with privileged information only available during training.

Result: Experimental results on multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets show the approach outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-modal empathy prediction method with supervisory document-assisted training effectively leverages privileged information and multi-modal processing to achieve superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Prevalent empathy prediction techniques primarily concentrate on a singular modality, typically textual, thus neglecting multi-modal processing capabilities. They also overlook the utilization of certain privileged information, which may encompass additional empathetic content. In response, we introduce an advanced multi-modal empathy prediction method integrating video, audio, and text information. The method comprises the Multi-Modal Empathy Prediction and Supervisory Documentation Assisted Training. We use pre-trained networks in the empathy prediction network to extract features from various modalities, followed by a cross-modal fusion. This process yields a multi-modal feature representation, which is employed to predict empathy labels. To enhance the extraction of text features, we incorporate supervisory documents as privileged information during the assisted training phase. Specifically, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to identify potential topic distributions to constrain text features. These supervisory documents, created by supervisors, focus on the counseling topics and the counselor's display of empathy. Notably, this privileged information is only available during training and is not accessible during the prediction phase. Experimental results on the multi-modal and dialogue empathy datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the existing methods.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger validates the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant by bringing LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment, overcoming significant technical challenges of in-editor interaction.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

TL;DR: IACT is a dynamic agent workflow system that grows recursive agent structures through user dialogue instead of pre-defined graphs, featuring bidirectional communication for error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, and to address error propagation in unidirectional function calls.

Method: IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven by user dialogue, autonomously growing dynamic recursive agent topologies incrementally tailored to problem structure. It replaces rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues for interactional redundancy.

Result: The system scales organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks, enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution, and has been deployed in production in the kragent.ai system with qualitative evidence from real-world workflows.

Conclusion: IACT provides a flexible, dialogue-driven approach to agent workflows that dynamically adapts to problem complexity while mitigating error propagation through bidirectional communication, demonstrating practical viability in production deployment.

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

### [167] [Target-specific Adaptation and Consistent Degradation Alignment for Cross-Domain Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02610)
*Yubo Hou,Mohamed Ragab,Min Wu,Chee-Keong Kwoh,Xiaoli Li,Zhenghua Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TACDA is a novel domain adaptation method for cross-domain RUL prediction that addresses domain discrepancy by combining adversarial adaptation with target domain reconstruction and consistent degradation stage alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven RUL prediction methods assume training and testing data come from the same distribution, which doesn't hold in real industrial settings. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods focus on domain-invariant features but overlook target-specific information and degradation stage consistency.

Method: TACDA proposes: 1) A target domain reconstruction strategy within adversarial adaptation to retain target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features; 2) A novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

Result: Extensive experiments show TACDA achieves remarkable performance, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches on two different evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: TACDA effectively addresses domain discrepancy in cross-domain RUL prediction by preserving target-specific information and ensuring consistent degradation stage alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach for reinforcement learning agents to follow arbitrary LTL instructions using Boolean formula sequences and GNN encoding to handle environments with multiple simultaneous high-level events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LTL-based RL approaches struggle in environments where multiple atomic propositions can be true simultaneously and interact in complex ways, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with concurrent events.

Method: The method conditions policies on sequences of simple Boolean formulae that directly align with automaton transitions, encoded via a graph neural network to create structured task representations.

Result: Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses limitations of previous LTL-based RL methods by handling environments with multiple simultaneous high-level events through structured task representations using Boolean formula sequences and GNN encoding.

Abstract: Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a compelling framework for specifying complex, structured tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Recent work has shown that interpreting LTL instructions as finite automata, which can be seen as high-level programs monitoring task progress, enables learning a single generalist policy capable of executing arbitrary instructions at test time. However, existing approaches fall short in environments where multiple high-level events (i.e., atomic propositions) can be true at the same time and potentially interact in complicated ways. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learning a multi-task policy for following arbitrary LTL instructions that addresses this shortcoming. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of simple Boolean formulae, which directly align with transitions in the automaton, and are encoded via a graph neural network (GNN) to yield structured task representations. Experiments in a complex chess-based environment demonstrate the advantages of our approach.

### [169] [Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02677)
*Zhiyuan He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates depth generalization in LLMs - their ability to handle deeper nested recursive structures than seen during training, revealing that standard transformers struggle with this despite handling longer sequences, and proposes a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline to address this limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a distinct and underexplored limitation in LLMs: depth generalization. While prior research focused on length generalization (handling longer sequences), this work investigates models' ability to handle deeper nested hierarchical structures (recursion depth) than encountered during training, which is crucial for tasks involving mathematical expressions, logical formulas, and other recursive problems.

Method: The authors develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. This method enables handling deeper recursion by breaking down complex nested structures.

Result: The method was evaluated in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with controllable recursion depth. Results show that the proposed approach effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth, demonstrating improved depth generalization compared to standard transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Standard transformer architectures struggle with depth generalization due to their inability to maintain stack-like behavior for tracking nested dependencies. The proposed looped locate-and-replace pipeline successfully addresses this limitation by decomposing recursive problems, enabling better handling of deeper nested structures than seen during training.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIGR framework improves multimodal emotion understanding reliability by guiding reasoning to start from emotion-dominant modality, reducing reasoning drift and emotionally inconsistent explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal emotion understanding methods suffer from reasoning drift where models rely on generated text over multimodal evidence, and explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths, leading to unreliable reasoning.

Method: Introduces Modality Importance (MI) mechanism to identify emotion-dominant modality, then reorganizes reasoning sequences to start from most critical modality. Uses two-stage framework: modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization to generate emotionally grounded explanations.

Result: On DFEW benchmark, MIGR reduces instances of correct predictions with emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%, substantially improving reasoning reliability.

Conclusion: Starting reasoning from emotion-dominant modality significantly improves reliability of multimodal emotion understanding, confirming the benefit of modality-guided reasoning approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing concerns about transparency, accountability, and copyright violations in generative models by enabling understanding of how specific training data contributes to model outputs.

Method: Uses multimodal large language models to extract structured triples from images aligned with domain-specific ontologies, then compares knowledge graphs of generated and training images to trace potential influences.

Result: Validated through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning and on large-scale models through style-specific experiments, demonstrating ability to trace training data influences.

Conclusion: The framework enables copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI, supporting development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity, and curiosity.

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock prediction is difficult due to market volatility and sensitivity to real-time events. LLMs struggle with noisy financial news data and lack explicit answers in text. General memory architectures fail to identify key price movement drivers.

Method: Propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework that structures news into events with horizontal consolidation (daily event integration) and longitudinal tracking (event evolution). Builds temporal event knowledge base and reflection knowledge base of causal experiences from event-price dynamics analysis.

Result: StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current approaches by structuring event knowledge and causal experiences, enabling better stock price prediction with improved transparency and explainability.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend static psychometric battery frameworks to dynamical systems, formalize agents as evolving systems with computational resource parameters, and provide a unified mathematical framework for analyzing self-improvement mechanisms in various AI architectures.

Method: Formalizes agents as flows ν_r parameterized by computational resource r, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. Proves this operator generates a vector field on parameter manifold Θ, identifies coefficient of self-improvement κ as Lie derivative of capability functional along the flow, and derives the Variance Inequality spectral condition for stability of self-improvement.

Result: Shows that sufficient condition for κ > 0 (positive self-improvement) is that combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough, up to curvature and step-size effects. Demonstrates that architectures like STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator satisfying the Variance Inequality through various mechanisms.

Conclusion: Provides a unified mathematical framework for analyzing self-improvement in dynamical agent systems, connecting diverse architectures through the GVU operator formalism and establishing theoretical conditions for stable self-improvement via the Variance Inequality.

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A causal concept-based framework for post-hoc XAI that generates local/global explanations using concept intervention probabilities, balancing understandability and faithfulness to the original model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for XAI explanations that are both understandable to humans and faithful to the non-interpretable models being explained, bridging the gap between model behavior and human comprehension.

Method: Uses a conceptual framework based on causal reasoning, calculating probability of sufficiency for concept interventions to generate local and global explanations. Implemented with a proof-of-concept model on CelebA dataset classifiers.

Result: Demonstrates understandability through clear concept-based vocabulary with implicit causal interpretation, and addresses fidelity by highlighting framework assumptions and alignment between explanation interpretation and generation contexts.

Conclusion: Proposes a causal concept-based approach to post-hoc XAI that successfully balances understandability and faithfulness, though requires careful attention to framework assumptions and context alignment for proper interpretation.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

*Zijie Lin,Qilin Cai,Liang Shen,Mingjun Xiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A prompt-free collaborative agent framework for automated paper reproduction that uses verification and refinement agents to improve code generation quality without manual prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated paper reproduction frameworks lack verification mechanisms at each generation step and rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, limiting adaptability and scalability.

Method: Proposes a prompt-free collaborative agent framework with two agents: a verification agent that checks outputs against system prompt requirements, and a refinement agent that revises outputs based on identified issues. Uses only original system prompts without human-crafted refinement prompts.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy and completeness of reproduced code by approximately 15% and 13% respectively compared to baseline. Demonstrates robustness and consistency across PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets, outperforming Self-Refine.

Conclusion: The prompt-free collaborative agent framework effectively enhances paper-to-code generation quality without manual prompt engineering, offering improved adaptability and scalability for automated paper reproduction.

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated radiology reporting methods focus only on report generation and neglect quality control, which is essential but tedious. There's a need for comprehensive AI support that mimics radiologists' holistic workflow including quality assurance.

Method: Uses large language models as reasoning backbone to orchestrate tools including region localization, image-guided region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment, and feedback-driven adaptive refinement.

Result: Experimental results show Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting performance.

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot provides accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting assistance, improving clinical efficiency by automating the holistic reporting process with integrated quality control.

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

### [180] [Martingale Score: An Unsupervised Metric for Bayesian Rationality in LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02914)
*Zhonghao He,Tianyi Qiu,Hirokazu Shirado,Maarten Sap*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics to measure belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning, finding widespread violations across models and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While reasoning techniques have improved LLM performance, there's concern that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior.

Method: Proposes an unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of the Martingale property (where future beliefs should be unpredictable from current beliefs), indicating deviation from rational Bayesian updating.

Result: Found widespread belief entrenchment across models and setups in open-ended domains (event forecasting, value-laden questions, academic paper review), where current belief positively predicts future belief updates. Identified which models, reasoning techniques, and domains are more prone to entrenchment.

Conclusion: The Martingale Score predicts ground-truth accuracy where available, making it a useful unsupervised proxy for truth-seeking ability in reasoning processes, even in domains without ground truth.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning techniques have substantially improved the performance of large language models (LLMs), raising expectations for their ability to provide accurate, truthful, and reliable information. However, emerging evidence suggests that iterative reasoning may foster belief entrenchment and confirmation bias, rather than enhancing truth-seeking behavior. In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available. This indicates that, while designed as an unsupervised metric that operates even in domains without access to ground truth, the Martingale Score is a useful proxy of the truth-seeking ability of a reasoning process.

### [181] [CoatFusion: Controllable Material Coating in Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02143)
*Sagie Levy,Elad Aharoni,Matan Levy,Ariel Shamir,Dani Lischinski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CoatFusion enables realistic material coating on objects while preserving geometry, outperforming existing methods through a diffusion model conditioned on albedo texture and PBR parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing material transfer methods replace intrinsic materials and overwrite fine details, but material coating simulates applying a thin material layer while preserving underlying geometry.

Method: Created DataCoat110K synthetic dataset of 3D objects with varied coatings, then developed CoatFusion architecture using diffusion model conditioned on 2D albedo texture and PBR parameters (roughness, metalness, transmission, thickness).

Result: CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on the material coating task.

Conclusion: Material coating is a novel task distinct from material transfer, and CoatFusion with its conditioning approach enables realistic coating simulation while preserving object geometry.

Abstract: We introduce Material Coating, a novel image editing task that simulates applying a thin material layer onto an object while preserving its underlying coarse and fine geometry. Material coating is fundamentally different from existing "material transfer" methods, which are designed to replace an object's intrinsic material, often overwriting fine details. To address this new task, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset (110K images) of 3D objects with varied, physically-based coatings, named DataCoat110K. We then propose CoatFusion, a novel architecture that enables this task by conditioning a diffusion model on both a 2D albedo texture and granular, PBR-style parametric controls, including roughness, metalness, transmission, and a key thickness parameter. Experiments and user studies show CoatFusion produces realistic, controllable coatings and significantly outperforms existing material editing and transfer methods on this new task.
