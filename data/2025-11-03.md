### [1] [Deep Neural Watermarking for Robust Copyright Protection in 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27533)
*Khandoker Ashik Uz Zaman,Mohammad Zahangir Alam,Mohammed N. M. Ali,Mahdi H. Miraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep neural watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection that embeds watermarks using SVD and extracts them using PointNet++ architecture, significantly outperforming traditional methods under various attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of 3D content in digital media requires effective copyright protection, but 3D point clouds are vulnerable to geometric and non-geometric attacks that degrade conventional watermark signals.

Method: Embeds binary watermarks into singular values of 3D point cloud blocks using SVD and leverages PointNet++ neural network architecture for reliable watermark extraction after various attacks including rotation, scaling, noise, cropping, and signal distortions.

Result: Deep learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based techniques, achieving bitwise accuracy up to 0.83 and IoU of 0.80 compared to SVD's 0.58 accuracy and 0.26 IoU for the most severe Crop (70%) attack.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates superior watermark recovery and maintains high fidelity even under severe distortions, providing effective copyright protection for 3D point clouds.

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

### [2] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench is a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models' ability to read measurement instruments, showing that even top VLMs struggle with precise measurement reading due to poor indicator localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models find it surprisingly challenging to read measurement instruments despite this being effortless for humans, highlighting a fundamental limitation in fine-grained spatial grounding.

Method: Created MeasureBench with real-world and synthesized measurement images, plus an extensible pipeline for procedural gauge generation with controllable visual elements like pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter.

Result: Evaluation shows frontier VLMs struggle with measurement reading, consistently failing at indicator localization - they can read digits but misidentify pointer positions, leading to large numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals fundamental limitations in VLMs' fine-grained spatial grounding and aims to advance visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception, bridging the gap between number recognition and real-world measurement.

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [3] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive transformer framework for multi-institutional QCT segmentation that addresses domain shift using adversarial and statistical alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models trained on one dataset often fail when applied to others due to domain shift from varying scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics, making automated segmentation unreliable across institutions.

Method: A 3D TransUNet backbone with two complementary strategies: adversarial alignment via Gradient Reversal Layer to avoid encoding site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy to reduce distributional mismatches between institutions.

Result: The model was trained and validated on one of the largest hip fracture cohorts with 1,024 QCT images from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for proximal femur segmentation.

Conclusion: The dual alignment mechanism enables scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail, overcoming domain shift barriers for multi-center osteoporosis research.

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [4] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS introduces Directional Consistency-driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting, reducing primitive count by up to 30% while improving reconstruction quality by incorporating gradient angular coherence into splitting decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Adaptive Density Control (ADC) in 3D Gaussian Splatting relies only on positional gradient magnitudes for primitive splitting, which may lead to redundant splitting and suboptimal alignment with local structures. The authors aim to better capture local structural complexities and reduce unnecessary primitives.

Method: The method incorporates Directional Consistency (DC) of gradients into ADC through angular coherence analysis. DC helps identify when splitting is truly needed and determines optimal split positions that align sub-primitives with local structures, replacing the conventional random placement approach.

Result: DC4GS achieves significant reduction in primitive count (up to 30%) compared to existing ADC methods while simultaneously enhancing reconstruction fidelity. The method demonstrates improved efficiency in representing 3D scenes with fewer primitives.

Conclusion: Incorporating directional consistency into adaptive density control for 3D Gaussian Splatting effectively reduces redundant splitting and optimizes primitive placement, leading to more efficient scene representation with improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

### [5] [Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26923)
*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SACL is a dynamic curriculum learning method that adapts to data scale, improving lung nodule detection performance under limited data conditions without requiring architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches struggle with limited annotated data in clinical settings, and traditional static curriculum learning fails in data-scarce scenarios.

Method: Proposes Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL) with three mechanisms: adaptive epoch scheduling, hard sample injection, and scale-aware optimization, evaluated on LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11.

Result: SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum on full dataset, but shows significant improvements under data-limited conditions: 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively.

Conclusion: SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited annotation resources by enabling robust training across varying data scales.

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNAPSE-Net is a unified adaptive framework for brain lesion segmentation that integrates multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck, cross-modal attention fusion, and hierarchical gated decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for brain lesion segmentation are specialized point solutions that lack generalization and have high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability.

Method: Hybrid architecture with multi-stream CNN encoders, Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF), hierarchical gated decoder, trained with variance reduction strategy combining pathology-specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art DSC of 0.831 (HD95: 3.03) on WMH dataset, best boundary accuracy on ISLES 2022 (HD95: 9.69), and highest DSC for tumor core (0.8651) on BraTS 2020.

Conclusion: The unified adaptive framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source

### [7] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SFAT, a Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer model for generating contextually appropriate live video comments by prioritizing semantically relevant frames and leveraging multimodal knowledge from both video content and viewer chats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for live video comment generation overlook prioritizing video frames most relevant to ongoing viewer interactions, which is crucial for producing contextually appropriate comments. Current datasets also have limitations in language diversity and video categories.

Method: Proposed SFAT model uses CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge, assigns weights to video frames based on semantic relevance to viewer conversations, employs weighted sum of frames to emphasize informative content, and uses a cross-attention comment decoder that attends to both chat and video modalities.

Result: Created a large-scale English video comments dataset from Twitch covering 11 categories with 438 hours and 3.2 million comments. Demonstrated SFAT's effectiveness compared to existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue contexts.

Conclusion: The SFAT model successfully addresses the gap in prioritizing semantically relevant video frames for live comment generation and provides a more diverse dataset for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Result: Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs.

Conclusion: The proposed IRD framework effectively addresses key challenges in incremental HOI detection including catastrophic forgetting, interaction drift, and zero-shot HOI detection in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM is a fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous driving that extends SAM with dual-encoder architecture and deformable decoder, achieving superior performance on Cityscapes and BDD100K benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the spatial and geometric complexity of road scenes in autonomous driving by enhancing SAM's capabilities for semantic segmentation tasks.

Method: Extends SAM with dual-encoder combining global semantic context from ViT-H with local spatial detail from ResNet-50, plus deformable fusion module and progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention. Uses hybrid loss combining Focal, Dice, Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses.

Result: Achieves 68.1 mIoU on Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU. Shows strong cross-domain generalization (0.87 retention score), faster convergence (30-40 epochs), and data efficiency (0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples).

Conclusion: Targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models enable reliable and scalable autonomous driving perception with improved accuracy, generalization, and data efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [12] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT introduces a hierarchical neural field representation using transformers to learn general 3D shape hierarchies across categories in an unsupervised manner, enabling automatic discovery of substructures and multi-level segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible hierarchical representation for 3D shapes that can automatically learn parent-child relationships and common substructures across diverse shape categories without fixed hierarchical constraints.

Method: Uses a hierarchical transformer with compressed codebook to learn parent-child relationships in tree hierarchies, trained with reconstruction loss without fixed structural constraints except node limits per level.

Result: Successfully captures meaningful containment relationships and achieves unsupervised shape segmentation across all 55 ShapeNet categories with multiple granularity levels.

Conclusion: HiT provides a general and flexible approach for learning hierarchical 3D shape representations that outperform prior methods by inferring structure directly from data across multiple categories.

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

### [13] [ZEBRA: Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Subject Generalization for Universal Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27128)
*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA is a zero-shot fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework that disentangles subject-related and semantic-related components from fMRI representations, enabling generalization to unseen subjects without subject-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fMRI-to-image reconstruction methods require subject-specific models or fine-tuning, limiting scalability and real-world applicability. The goal is to develop a universal neural decoding approach that works across different subjects without additional training.

Method: ZEBRA uses adversarial training to decompose fMRI representations into subject-related and semantic-related components, explicitly disentangling them to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations for zero-shot generalization.

Result: ZEBRA significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics, demonstrating effective generalization to unseen subjects.

Conclusion: ZEBRA represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding by eliminating the need for subject-specific adaptation while maintaining high reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model

### [14] [WildfireX-SLAM: A Large-scale Low-altitude RGB-D Dataset for Wildfire SLAM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27133)
*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces WildfireX-SLAM, a synthetic dataset for 3D Gaussian splatting-based SLAM in large-scale forest environments, addressing the lack of real-world datasets for wildfire and forest applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for 3DGS-based SLAM methods in large-scale forest scenes for applications like wildfire emergency response and forest management, but existing datasets are limited and real-world data collection is costly and infeasible.

Method: Developed a pipeline using Unreal Engine 5 to collect synthetic aerial and ground views with ground-truth camera poses and multiple data modalities from UAVs, with flexible environmental controls for light, weather, and wildfire conditions.

Result: Created WildfireX-SLAM dataset with 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images covering 16 km² of forest area, and conducted a benchmark revealing unique challenges for 3DGS-based SLAM in forest environments.

Conclusion: The synthetic dataset enables research on 3DGS-based SLAM for forest and wildfire applications, highlighting specific challenges and providing a foundation for future improvements in this domain.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MMDiT is an efficient multimodal diffusion transformer with only 304M parameters that achieves fast image synthesis using minimal training resources, trained on just 25M public data in 1.5 days on 8 GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing diffusion models that require large-scale training data, significant computational resources, or suffer from high latency and heavy structure.

Method: Uses token reduction strategy with compressive visual tokenizer, multi-path compression module, Position Reinforcement for spatial coherence, Alternating Subregion Attention (ASA) to reduce computation, and AdaLN-affine for efficient modulation.

Result: Achieves 0.66 on GenEval for 512px generation, easily reaching 0.72 with post-training techniques like GRPO, while being trained with minimal resources.

Conclusion: E-MMDiT serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes to democratizing generative AI models by making them more accessible with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes
to democratization of generative AI models.

### [16] [Improving Cross-view Object Geo-localization: A Dual Attention Approach with Cross-view Interaction and Multi-Scale Spatial Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27139)
*Xingtao Ling Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-view object geo-localization method with Cross-view Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) for iterative view interaction and Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) for multi-scale feature extraction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CVOGL and new G2D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to effectively transfer information between views and don't refine spatial relationship feature maps, leading to erroneous focus on irrelevant edge noise that affects localization performance.

Method: Proposes CVCAM for multiple iterations of cross-view interaction to exchange contextual information and suppress edge noise, plus MHSAM using various convolutional kernels to extract multi-scale spatial features from feature maps with implicit correspondences.

Result: Extensive experiments on CVOGL and newly created G2D datasets demonstrate high localization accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations in cross-view information transfer and feature map refinement, achieving superior performance in cross-view object geo-localization tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

### [17] [HiGS: Hierarchical Generative Scene Framework for Multi-Step Associative Semantic Spatial Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27148)
*Jiacheng Hong,Kunzhen Wu,Mingrui Yu,Yichao Gu,Shengze Xue,Shuangjiu Xiao,Deli Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiGS is a hierarchical generative framework for 3D scene generation that enables iterative scene expansion through multi-step associative semantic spatial composition, allowing users to focus on key elements while the model automatically completes peripheral areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-step generation methods struggle to balance scene complexity with minimal user input. Inspired by human cognitive processes in scene modeling (global-to-local progression, focusing on key elements, semantic association), the authors aim to provide fine-grained control while maintaining coherence.

Method: Proposes HiGS framework with Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph (PHiSSG) that dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic dependencies. Maintains one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and objects, supports recursive layout optimization for spatial and geometric consistency throughout generation.

Result: Experiments show HiGS outperforms single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user preference, demonstrating superior performance in 3D scene generation.

Conclusion: HiGS offers a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D scene construction, providing users with iterative control over regions of interest while maintaining overall scene coherence.

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

*Yuanhao Tang,Xuechao Zou,Zhengpei Hu,Junliang Xing,Chengkun Zhang,Jianqiang Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFM-Net is a novel framework for remote sensing image classification that combines CNN and Mamba pathways with hierarchical fusion to achieve effective local-global co-representation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing image classification faces challenges due to complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics. Existing methods struggle with efficiently integrating CNNs (good for local textures) and Transformers (good for global context) due to high computational costs.

Method: AFM-Net uses a dual-pathway approach: CNN branch for hierarchical visual priors and Mamba branch for efficient global sequence modeling. It employs Hierarchical Fusion Mechanism for progressive multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-level interaction, plus a Mixture-of-Experts classifier for adaptive feature routing.

Result: Achieved 93.72% accuracy on AID, 95.54% on NWPU-RESISC45, and 96.92% on UC Merced datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: AFM-Net effectively addresses the local-global representation challenge in remote sensing classification through hierarchical fusion and adaptive expert routing, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores using deep learning models to approximate Banff lesion scores for renal transplant biopsies through a modular, rule-based framework that decomposes indicators into structural and inflammatory components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Banff Classification is the global standard for renal transplant biopsy evaluation but faces challenges due to its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and inter-observer variability, making computational replication difficult.

Method: Decompose Banff indicators into constituent structural and inflammatory components, use existing segmentation and detection tools to compute them, map model outputs to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert guidelines, and evaluate against expert-annotated ground truths.

Result: Findings show partial successes but also critical failure modes including structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate representations often undermine interpretability.

Conclusion: Current AI pipelines have limitations in replicating expert-level computational grading, highlighting the importance of modular evaluation and computational Banff grading standards for guiding future model development in transplant pathology.

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

*Hankyeol Lee,Gawon Seo,Kyounggyu Lee,Dogun Kim,Kyungwoo Song,Jiyoung Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline combining vision-language models, large language models, and object detection systems to generate more detailed and accurate captions for high-resolution images by addressing the limitations of VLMs trained on low-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models struggle with high-resolution images due to pre-training on low-resolution inputs, leading to loss of visual details and omission of important objects when downscaling.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: initial VLM caption generation, LLM identification of key objects and prediction of co-occurring objects, object detection verification, and region-specific captioning for newly detected objects not in initial caption.

Result: Enhanced captions show more detail and reliability while effectively minimizing hallucinations, as demonstrated through pairwise comparison, quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, and hallucination detection benchmarks on high-resolution images.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline successfully addresses the limitations of VLMs for high-resolution images by integrating multiple AI components to produce more detailed, accurate captions with reduced hallucinations.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M^3Detection is a multi-frame 3D object detection framework that fuses camera and 4D imaging radar data through multi-level feature fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-frame camera-radar fusion methods capture only partial scene information and suffer from image degradation and radar sparsity. Multi-frame fusion provides richer spatiotemporal information but faces challenges in robust cross-modal feature fusion and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework leverages intermediate features from baseline detectors and tracker-generated reference trajectories. It includes global-level inter-object feature aggregation guided by radar, local-level inter-grid feature aggregation along trajectories, and trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning for cross-frame interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating the effectiveness of multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Conclusion: M^3Detection successfully addresses the limitations of single-frame fusion by providing a unified multi-frame framework that efficiently combines complementary camera and radar modalities through multi-level feature fusion and spatiotemporal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

*Yucheng Xing,Jinxing Yin,Xiaodong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCER is a novel framework for realistic single-person dance synthesis using stable video diffusion models, featuring Appearance Enhancement and Pose Rendering modules to improve reference image detail capture and motion guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation, especially for human-involved content like dancing, is challenging due to high quality requirements, video continuity needs, and the complexity of human motions. Current methods struggle with capturing detailed appearance and motion guidance effectively.

Method: The framework integrates two key modules: Appearance Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus on reference image details, and Pose Rendering Module (PRM) to extend motion guidance from extra domains. Uses stable video diffusion model as base and collects TikTok-3K dataset for enhanced training.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in single-person dance synthesis.

Conclusion: DANCER effectively addresses the challenges of realistic dance video generation through specialized modules for appearance enhancement and pose rendering, demonstrating improved performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2-Cache is a hierarchical caching mechanism for diffusion models that separates denoising into structure-defining and detail-refining stages, using dual-threshold caching with pooled feature summarization to achieve 5.08x acceleration while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face practical deployment challenges due to high computational costs of iterative denoising. Existing caching techniques create trade-offs between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and computational overhead.

Method: H2-Cache employs hierarchical caching with dual-threshold system to selectively cache structure-defining and detail-refining stages separately. Uses pooled feature summarization (PFS) for lightweight similarity estimation.

Result: Achieves up to 5.08x acceleration while maintaining image quality nearly identical to baseline. Outperforms existing caching methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on Flux architecture.

Conclusion: H2-Cache provides a robust solution that resolves the speed-quality dilemma in diffusion models, significantly lowering barriers for real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

*Guanchong Huang,Song Fang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SilhouetteTell is a novel video identification attack that uses subtitle silhouettes' spatiotemporal features to infer both online and offline videos, achieving high accuracy from distances up to 40 meters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video identification attacks pose serious privacy threats by revealing users' viewing habits, which can expose personal information like hobbies, beliefs, and health status, potentially leading to profiling, discrimination, or blackmail.

Method: The approach analyzes subtitle silhouettes displayed on screens, combining spatial information (content-based silhouette shapes) and temporal information (timing differences between consecutive subtitles) to create spatiotemporal features that correlate with video subtitle files.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on smartphones demonstrate high efficacy in inferring video titles and clips under various settings, including successful identification from distances up to 40 meters.

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell presents a significant privacy vulnerability by enabling video identification through subtitle silhouette analysis, highlighting the need for better privacy protection mechanisms against such spatiotemporal correlation attacks.

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

*Guozheng Zheng,Jian Guan,Mingjie Xie,Xuanjia Zhao,Congyi Fan,Shiheng Zhang,Pengming Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPHR is a dual-level progressive hardness-aware reweighting strategy for cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery that addresses viewpoint gaps and hard negatives through sample-level difficulty assessment and batch-level adaptive loss weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization between drone and satellite imagery faces challenges from severe viewpoint gaps and hard negatives (visually similar but geographically mismatched samples). Existing mining or reweighting strategies use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence.

Method: Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy with two components: 1) Sample-level Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module that evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives, and 2) Batch-level Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism that uses training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures.

Result: Experiments on University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DPHR strategy effectively addresses the challenges of cross-view geo-localization by providing progressive and adaptive handling of hard negatives through dual-level reweighting, leading to more stable convergence and improved performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MIVA, a new multimodal deception detection task using Werewolf game data, and shows that current MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle significantly with truth/falsehood distinction despite their strong multimodal capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems become more integrated into human lives, robust social intelligence including deception detection is crucial. Current automatic deception detection in dynamic multi-party conversations remains challenging, and MLLMs' capabilities in this domain are largely unquantified.

Method: The authors introduce the Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA) task and create a novel multimodal dataset from the social deduction game Werewolf, providing synchronized video, text, and verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarking reveals a significant performance gap - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to reliably distinguish truth from falsehood. Failure analysis shows models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in alignment.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for novel approaches to build more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems that can effectively detect deception by integrating multimodal social cues.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

### [27] [Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Spatial Morphology Analysis of Traditional Villages via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27208)
*Jiaxin Zhang,Zehong Zhu,Junye Deng,Yunqin Li,and Bowen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model using multi-source data to analyze village spatial morphology, achieving improved performance in classification tasks through multimodal fusion and joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing village studies that use single-disciplinary perspectives and qualitative methods, constrained by lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data for analyzing spatial morphology.

Method: Develops HGNN model with input/communication nodes and static/dynamic edges, combining GCN and GAT with two-stage feature update mechanism. Introduces relational pooling and joint training across 17 village subtypes.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches, with mean accuracy/F1 increasing from 0.71/0.83 to 0.82/0.90 through joint optimization, driven by 6% gain for parcel tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides scientific evidence for exploring village spatial patterns and generative logic, effectively addressing current research limitations in village spatial morphology analysis.

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and
generative logic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel continual self-supervised learning framework for chest CT images that addresses domain shifts from different window settings while ensuring data privacy through latent replay and feature distillation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in medical image diagnosis including scarcity of large annotated datasets, domain shifts from different CT window settings optimized for clinical purposes, and privacy constraints that prevent reusing past data.

Method: Uses continual pretraining on unlabeled images with latent replay-based mechanism to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining privacy. Incorporates feature distillation combining Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE) for robust representations.

Result: Validated on chest CT images across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared to other approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles domain shifts in chest CT images through continual self-supervised learning while ensuring data privacy, achieving robust and generalizable models for medical image diagnosis.

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

*Renjie Ji,Xue Wang,Chao Niu,Wen Zhang,Yong Mei,Kun Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecAware is a hyperspectral foundation model that uses sensor meta-attributes and image content to enable unified multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping, achieving superior performance across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI foundation models overlook sensor meta-attributes and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting transferability across different sensors and scenes.

Method: Two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding: 1) Meta-content aware module fuses sensor attributes and image content, 2) HyperEmbedding module uses sample-conditioned hypernetwork to generate matrix factors for adaptive spatial-spectral feature processing.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets show SpecAware learns superior representations, excelling in land-cover semantic segmentation, change detection, and scene classification.

Conclusion: SpecAware establishes a unified framework for joint pre-training across diverse sensors, enabling adaptive processing of variable spectral channels and improved feature interpretation.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in scaling 3D models due to complex geometric supervision and diverse 3D data, while improving robustness under real-world conditions.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture for dynamic feature routing, incorporates confidence-based depth refinement module, integrates dense semantic features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations, and employs tailored loss functions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective downstream applications without extra computation.

Conclusion: MoRE successfully addresses 3D model scaling challenges through expert specialization and robust geometric estimation, demonstrating superior performance in diverse 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

TL;DR: Object-IR is a self-supervised image retargeting method that uses mesh warping optimization guided by object appearance consistency and geometric constraints to eliminate distortion in semantically important regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intractable challenge of eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions during image retargeting, without requiring manually annotated datasets.

Method: Reformulates image retargeting as learning-based mesh warping optimization using a CNN to predict mesh grid motions, with comprehensive objective function including object-consistent loss, geometric-preserving loss, and boundary loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on RetargetMe benchmark, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and subjective visual quality, with efficient processing (0.009s for 1024x683 resolution) and real-time performance on consumer GPUs.

Conclusion: Object-IR provides an effective self-supervised solution for high-quality image retargeting that preserves object appearance and geometry while eliminating the need for manual annotations.

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuseCPath is a novel framework for fusing heterogeneous pathological foundation models (FMs) in whole slide image analysis, addressing performance variability caused by different training datasets and architectures. It uses multi-view clustering for patch selection, cluster-level re-embedding for patch-level fusion, and collaborative distillation for slide-level fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathological foundation models show substantial heterogeneity due to diverse private training datasets and different network architectures, leading to performance variability in downstream tasks when using features from different FMs.

Method: 1) Multi-view clustering-based method to filter discriminative patches using multiple FMs' embeddings; 2) Cluster-level re-embedding strategy to capture patch-level local features; 3) Collaborative distillation strategy to explore connections between slide-level FMs.

Result: Extensive experiments on TCGA datasets (lung cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer) demonstrate that FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Conclusion: FuseCPath effectively fuses heterogeneous pathological foundation models and achieves superior ensemble performance in computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-phase training method using spatial and frequency domain denoising with Discrete Wavelet Transform to defend against adversarial attacks on DNNs, achieving improved classification accuracy across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, limiting their use in security-critical applications. The authors aim to develop robust defense mechanisms against these attacks.

Method: Two-phase training: first trains a denoising network combining spatial features and wavelet transforms via transformer layer, then retrains the classifier using denoised images. Uses Discrete Wavelet Transform for frequency analysis to address high-frequency corruption in attacked images.

Result: Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST show the method significantly improves classification accuracy, outperforming denoising networks and adversarial training approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid spatial-frequency domain denoising approach effectively enhances DNN robustness against adversarial attacks, providing superior defense performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause incorrect predictions with small input perturbations, making robust deep-learning systems crucial for deployment.

Method: Utilizes contrastive learning with contrastive loss function to train classification models using both clean and adversarially perturbed images, optimizing model parameters alongside perturbations.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in model robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: Contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for zero-shot action recognition using web-crawled descriptions and LLM-extracted keywords to address ambiguity in multi-semantic action classes, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models face challenges in zero-shot action recognition due to ambiguity from multi-semantic words in action classes, which limits their ability to understand intended action concepts accurately.

Method: The approach uses web-crawled descriptions processed by large-language models to extract relevant keywords, eliminating manual annotation. It also introduces a spatio-temporal interaction module to align description attributes with video content by focusing on objects and action units.

Result: The model achieves impressive zero-shot accuracies: 81.0% on UCF-101, 53.1% on HMDB-51, and 68.9% on Kinetics-600, demonstrating strong performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses semantic ambiguity in action recognition through automated description processing and spatio-temporal alignment, showing superior adaptability and effectiveness for zero-shot action recognition tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionRAG shifts multi-modal RAG from document-level to region-level retrieval, reducing irrelevant visual content by focusing on salient patches and grouping them into semantic regions, improving both efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal RAG methods treat entire documents as retrieval units, introducing substantial irrelevant visual content that dilutes focus on salient information and degrades performance through redundant contexts.

Method: Proposes a framework with hybrid supervision during training to pinpoint relevant patches, and a dynamic inference pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete semantic regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks, improving retrieval accuracy by 10.02% in R@1 on average and increasing question answering accuracy by 3.56% while using only 71.42% visual tokens compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: RegionRAG effectively addresses the limitations of document-level retrieval by enabling the generator to focus solely on concise visual content relevant to queries, significantly improving both efficiency and accuracy in multi-modal RAG systems.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on
average and increases question answering accuracy by 3.56\% while using only
71.42\% visual tokens compared to prior methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T^3 is a test-time adaptive merging framework for medical vision-language models that dynamically combines pretrained and fine-tuned models using Jensen-Shannon divergence, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse medical modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing model-merging techniques in medical imaging, where static interpolation fails to handle modality shifts and diverse clinical tasks effectively.

Method: Proposes T^3 framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via Jensen-Shannon divergence between model output distributions, with a batch-wise extension T^3_B to reduce computational costs.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error reduction across four medical modalities, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: T^3 enables adaptive deployment of medical vision-language models in clinical settings by dynamically balancing specialist precision and generalist robustness.

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Motivation: Current GUI grounding models lack self-awareness of their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable predictions. This is critical in dynamic GUI automation where single errors can cause task failure.

Method: Proposes HyperClick with dual reward mechanism: binary reward for correct actions and truncated Gaussian-based spatial confidence modeling calibrated using Brier score. Jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability.

Result: Extensive experiments on seven challenge benchmarks show HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing well-calibrated confidence. Reduces overconfidence and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Conclusion: HyperClick enables explicit confidence calibration and introspective self-criticism, making GUI agents more reliable by reducing overconfidence and improving uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

### [40] [FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280)
*Zirui Zhu,Hailun Xu,Yang Luo,Yong Liu,Kanchan Sarkar,Zhenheng Yang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a training-free keyframe selection method that treats frame selection as a combinatorial bandit problem, using confidence bounds to efficiently identify informative video frames under strict token budgets, achieving significant accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing keyframe selection methods for long videos either uniformly subsample frames or use retrieval-style scoring, which can miss informative moments and require pre-filtering, making them inefficient for hour-long videos in multimodal LLMs.

Method: FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration problem in multi-armed bandits, treating temporal clips as arms and using empirical means with Bernstein confidence bounds to identify high-value regions through a two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure.

Result: On long-video QA benchmarks, FOCUS achieves substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it delivers an 11.9% accuracy gain on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: FOCUS provides an effective, model-agnostic solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs, demonstrating that intelligent frame selection can significantly improve performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

### [41] [Rethinking Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27285)
*Qinghong Yin,Yu Tian,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-GRACE is a novel concept erasure method for diffusion models that uses semantic guidance to generate adversarial samples, achieving 26% better erasure performance while reducing training time by 90% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods in diffusion models use adversarial training but neglect the specificity of concept space fitting, leading to partial mitigation and disruption of other concepts. The authors aim to address how adversarial samples can truly fit target concept spaces.

Method: S-GRACE (Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure) leverages semantic guidance within concept space to generate adversarial samples and perform erasure training, ensuring comprehensive coverage of target concepts without disrupting other concept spaces.

Result: Experiments with seven state-of-the-art methods and three adversarial prompt strategies show S-GRACE improves erasure performance by 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training time by 90%.

Conclusion: S-GRACE effectively addresses the limitations of existing concept erasure methods by incorporating semantic guidance, achieving superior performance in removing sensitive content from diffusion models while maintaining efficiency and preserving non-target concepts.

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASR-Net is a three-stage pipeline for coronary artery segmentation that combines multichannel preprocessing, a UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder, and contour refinement to achieve superior performance in detecting narrow and stenotic vessels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of coronary artery disease is critical but poor X-ray image quality can impede clinical diagnosis. There's a need for automated segmentation methods that can handle both healthy and stenotic arteries effectively.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Multichannel preprocessing combining CLAHE and improved Ben Graham method, 2) Segmentation network using UNet with DenseNet121 encoder and Self-ONN decoder to preserve vessel continuity, 3) Contour refinement module to suppress false positives.

Result: Achieved IoU of 61.43%, DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36% on combined public datasets with 5-fold cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Multichannel preprocessing provided incremental gains of 0.31-0.89% DSC and 0.40-1.16% IoU.

Conclusion: CASR-Net provides a robust automated coronary artery segmentation approach that can support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly effective for detecting narrow and stenotic vessel branches.

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P²IOD introduces parameterized prompts for incremental object detection to handle co-occurring objects across tasks, using neural networks as adaptive prompts with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which is unsuitable for object detection due to co-occurrence of objects from previous tasks in current images, causing confusion in prompts pool.

Method: P²IOD uses neural networks as parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks, with a parameterized prompts fusion strategy to constrain structure updates and prevent catastrophic forgetting.

Result: Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets show P²IOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in incremental object detection.

Conclusion: Parameterized prompts with adaptive consolidation properties and constrained updates effectively address the co-occurrence challenge in incremental object detection, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

TL;DR: SAGS is a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework that improves deformable tissue reconstruction in endoscopic videos by addressing aliasing and artifacts caused by tissue movement, achieving superior performance on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods for surgical reconstruction face challenges with aliasing and artifacts from tissue movement, which degrade visualization quality in endoscopic scenes.

Method: Proposed SAGS framework with attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder using 3D smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts and capture fine tissue movement details.

Result: Experimental results on EndoNeRF and SCARED benchmarks show superior performance in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, with better visualization quality.

Conclusion: SAGS effectively addresses the challenges of aliasing and artifacts in deformable tissue reconstruction, providing high-quality surgical visualization while maintaining reconstruction efficiency.

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

TL;DR: Proposes an ultra-low bitrate visual communication method that combines text-to-image generation with deep image compression, achieving same quality as existing methods with much less bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for ultra-low bitrate visual communication in challenging scenarios like deep space exploration and battlefield intelligence, where existing text-to-image models only provide semantic approximations insufficient for precise visual analysis.

Method: Integrates image generation with deep image compression using joint text and coding latent to guide rectified flow models for precise visual scene generation, encoding both semantic text and coding latent at very low bit rates.

Result: Experimental results show the method achieves same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using significantly less bandwidth.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enables ultra-low bitrate visual communication without sacrificing accuracy for vision analysis and human interactions, with code to be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: CIELR is a novel method that converts complex image editing instructions into simple, explicit actions using LLM reasoning, eliminating the need for joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex editing instructions and require computationally expensive joint fine-tuning of LLMs and diffusion models, which has high training costs.

Method: Constructs structured semantic representation of input images using foundation models, then uses iterative update mechanism to progressively refine this representation into fine-grained visual representations for flexible editing.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR on SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set, and also performs better on the new CIEBench benchmark containing 86 image samples.

Conclusion: CIELR enables efficient complex image editing without joint fine-tuning, achieving superior performance in preserving consistent regions while handling complex reasoning-based editing tasks.

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods primarily focus on natural images and offer limited support for other visual modalities like videos and visual documents, creating a gap in multimodal embedding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage training strategy: first stage focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval; second stage uses improved InfoNCE loss with hardness-weighted mechanism and false negative mitigation. Also employs learnable temperature parameter and model souping.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on MMEB benchmark, achieving best overall score and outperforming all prior work on challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: RzenEmbed successfully bridges the modality gap by providing a unified framework for learning discriminative embeddings across diverse visual modalities while enhancing instruction-following capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods face limitations: addition-based methods cause inference latency and engineering complexity, while selection-based methods require full backward passes with high memory usage like full fine-tuning.

Method: FPS ranks parameters by the product of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both pre-trained knowledge and downstream data to identify optimal parameter subsets in a single forward pass without gradients.

Result: On 24 visual tasks from FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly 9x and accelerating parameter selection by about 2x.

Conclusion: FPS offers a genuinely memory-efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models by eliminating gradient computation while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Motivation: To enable efficient synthesis of cinematic scenes for television and film production from small datasets, addressing the need for domain-specific visual style adaptation while maintaining motion quality.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) LoRA modules integrated into cross-attention layers of Wan2.1 I2V-14B model for visual style adaptation using small clip datasets, 2) Fine-tuned model generates keyframes that are temporally expanded into coherent sequences using video decoder, with parallelization and sequence partitioning for accelerated inference.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, plus expert user study, show measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over base model, with efficient domain transfer achieved within hours on single GPU.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables practical cinematic scene synthesis with domain-specific visual styles while maintaining motion quality, with released training and inference pipeline supporting reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a co-designed framework for universal video retrieval, including a new benchmark (UVRB), data synthesis workflow, and Modality Pyramid training curriculum, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video retrieval systems are structurally misaligned due to narrow benchmarks that incentivize limited data and single-task training, suppressing universal capability and lacking diagnostic evaluation for multi-dimensional generalization.

Method: Three-part framework: (1) Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB) with 16 datasets for performance measurement and capability gap diagnosis, (2) scalable synthesis workflow generating 1.55M high-quality pairs, (3) Modality Pyramid curriculum training General Video Embedder (GVE) by leveraging latent interconnections in diverse data.

Result: GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. Analysis reveals popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

Conclusion: The co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval by addressing structural misalignment through integrated evaluation, data, and modeling approaches.

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

Motivation: Existing methods extract hierarchical features from text but represent images with single features, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal modality alignment in vision-language models.

Method: Constructs tree-like hierarchical features for both images and text using semantic-aware visual feature extraction with cross-attention, embeds features into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures, and aligns them using KL distance minimization on heterogeneous manifolds via an intermediate manifold.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image datasets under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses modality asymmetry by aligning hierarchical features across vision and language modalities through hyperbolic manifold alignment with proven optimal intermediate manifold.

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

### [53] [A Hybrid Deep Learning and Forensic Approach for Robust Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27392)
*Sales Aribe Jr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid deepfake detection framework combining forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG traces, frequency analysis) with deep learning (CNNs and ViTs) achieves superior performance and robustness across multiple datasets and challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing deepfake detection methods - deep learning lacks generalization and forensic analysis struggles with new manipulation techniques - by creating a balanced hybrid approach.

Method: Fusion of forensic features (noise residuals, JPEG compression traces, frequency-domain descriptors) with deep learning representations from CNNs and vision transformers.

Result: Outperformed single-method baselines and state-of-the-art hybrid approaches on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF v2, and DFDC datasets with F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77 respectively. Maintained robustness under compression (F1=0.87), adversarial attacks (AUC=0.84), and unseen manipulations (F1=0.79).

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches provide balanced solutions combining deep learning adaptability with forensic interpretability, enabling resilient and trustworthy deepfake detection systems with enhanced transparency.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

*Aditya Parikh,Sneha Das,Aasa Feragen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper audits fairness in breast cancer tumor segmentation, revealing age-related bias against younger patients and showing how data aggregation affects ethnic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness evaluation in medical image segmentation is underexplored, and unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to healthcare disparities that may be amplified through clinical workflows and model development.

Method: The authors audit the fairness of automated segmentation labels in the MAMA-MIA breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset by evaluating segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source variables.

Result: The analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that persists even after controlling for confounding factors like data source. Data aggregation from multiple sources influences site-specific ethnic biases.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of investigating medical imaging data at a granular level to identify and address fairness issues in automated segmentation systems, particularly given the potential for biases to compound across clinical decision points.

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

### [55] [Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432)
*WonJun Moon,MinSeok Jung,Gilhan Park,Tae-Young Kim,Cheol-Ho Cho,Woojin Jun,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses semantic collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) by proposing methods to preserve semantic relationships in text queries and disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales, significantly improving retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods treat all annotated text-video pairs as positives and others as negatives, ignoring semantic variation within videos and across different videos. This causes embeddings of queries and video segments for distinct events within the same video to collapse together, while semantically similar content from different videos is driven apart, limiting retrieval performance.

Method: Proposes Text Correlation Preservation Learning to preserve semantic relationships across text queries, and Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA) to disentangle hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Also introduces order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to produce internally coherent yet mutually distinctive video segments.

Result: Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that the framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed methods successfully address semantic collapse in both text and video embedding spaces, leading to significant improvements in partially relevant video retrieval performance by better preserving semantic relationships and disentangling hierarchical video representations.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

*Yanlong Yang,Guanxiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSDI is a zero-shot, self-supervised framework for blind image deconvolution that uses iterative reverse self-diffusion without requiring pre-training, achieving superior performance in recovering sharp images and accurate blur kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional blind deconvolution methods rely on handcrafted priors, while deep learning approaches need extensive pre-training on external datasets, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Formulates blind deconvolution as iterative reverse self-diffusion starting from pure noise, with two randomly-initialized neural networks continuously optimized to refine sharp image and blur kernel. Uses noise scheduling for stability and L1-norm sparsity promotion for the kernel.

Result: Extensive experiments show DeblurSDI consistently achieves superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in highly degraded scenarios with remarkable robustness to blur kernel size variations.

Conclusion: DeblurSDI provides a zero-shot, self-supervised approach that dynamically learns instance-specific priors, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods without requiring external training data.

Abstract: Blind image deconvolution is a challenging ill-posed inverse problem, where
both the latent sharp image and the blur kernel are unknown. Traditional
methods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches
typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers show promise in medical imaging but face challenges with high computational demands and overfitting on small datasets, limiting their real-world clinical applicability.

Method: Integrates convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation through systematic architectural optimization.

Result: Achieves robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets, matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants with 5-20x parameter reduction, and Grad-CAM analyses show consistent attention to clinically relevant regions.

Conclusion: Principled ViT redesign enables development of efficient and interpretable models for low-resource medical imaging settings.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

*Jianwen Sun,Fanrui Zhang,Yukang Feng,Chuanhao Li,Zizhen Li,Jiaxin Ai,Yifan Chang,Yu Dai,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPainter is a multi-agent framework that generates editable vector graphics for scientific illustrations, addressing limitations of current raster image generation and code-based methods by providing element-level control and post-editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lack semantic structure for editing visual components, while code-based methods are cumbersome and unintuitive. Neither approach meets the needs for efficient, intuitive, and iterative scientific illustration creation.

Method: VisPainter uses a multi-agent framework with three specialized modules (Manager, Designer, Toolbox) built on model context protocol to collaboratively produce vector graphics diagrams compatible with standard software.

Result: The framework enables true element-level control where any element can be added and modified later. A benchmark called VisBench with seven-dimensional metrics was introduced to systematically evaluate scientific illustration quality.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments verified the architecture's rationality and evaluation reliability, providing fair model rankings and quantifying impacts of role division, step control, and description on illustration quality.

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

TL;DR: A multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for interactive school mapping using ML analysis, satellite imagery, and deep learning to improve educational facility records in developing regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and completeness of educational facility records in developing regions where data is scarce and infrequently updated.

Method: Three-tier approach: 1) ML analysis of population density, land cover, and infrastructure to identify gaps; 2) Medium-resolution satellite imagery (later removed); 3) VHR imagery with deep learning for detailed candidate locations, combined with interactive human validation interface.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show the multi-tiered strategy provides scalable and cost-effective solution for educational infrastructure mapping.

Conclusion: The framework offers an effective approach for supporting educational planning and resource allocation through improved school mapping accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes from advanced generative models pose serious threats, and existing audiovisual detection approaches struggle to generalize to unseen forgeries, necessitating more robust detection methods.

Conclusion: Cross-modal identity verification is crucial for future deepfake detection, and Referee demonstrates effective generalization capabilities through reference-aware audiovisual analysis.

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater exploration is crucial for resource exploration and national security, but progress is hindered by the lack of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning datasets and challenges from underwater image degradation.

Method: Constructed NautData dataset with 1.45M image-text pairs for 8 underwater tasks, introduced a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module using physical priors from underwater imaging models to restore clear underwater information, and integrated it into LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL baselines.

Result: Experiments on NautData and public underwater datasets show the VFE module consistently improves performance of both baselines on most supported tasks, demonstrating NAUTILUS's superiority in underwater scene understanding.

Conclusion: NAUTILUS effectively addresses underwater scene understanding challenges through the VFE module and comprehensive dataset, providing a robust solution for automated underwater exploration with publicly available data and models.

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning lacks clear understanding of what constitutes meaningful interleaved chains of thought between language and vision. The authors posit that text and image thoughts should function as complementary modalities that mutually advance reasoning rather than being isomorphic.

Method: Built ThinkMorph by fine-tuning on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with varying visual engagement. The model learns to generate progressive text-image reasoning steps that manipulate visual content while maintaining coherent verbal logic.

Result: Achieved large gains on vision-centric benchmarks (averaging 34.7% over base model) and generalized to out-of-domain tasks, matching or surpassing larger proprietary VLMs. Showed emergent multimodal intelligence including unseen visual manipulation skills, adaptive reasoning mode switching, and better test-time scaling.

Conclusion: ThinkMorph demonstrates promising directions for characterizing emergent capabilities of unified models for multimodal reasoning through complementary text-image reasoning chains that advance reasoning progressively.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual

Motivation: Spatial understanding remains a weakness in Large Vision-Language Models, and existing methods depend on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scalability.

Method: Introduces Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that automatically formulates five pretext tasks from RGB or RGB-D images: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction.

Result: Training on these tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning while preserving general visual capabilities, achieving average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over Qwen2.5-VL baselines across seven spatial understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple, intrinsic supervision enables reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation methods require complex constraint specifications that reduce usability. The authors aim to provide a more intuitive design experience by using sketches as natural constraints.

Method: Proposes a multimodal transformer-based solution that takes sketches and content assets as inputs to generate layouts. Introduces a novel method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale to avoid costly human annotation.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods on three public datasets (PubLayNet, DocLayNet, SlidesVQA) and releases O(200k) synthetically-generated sketches to facilitate future research.

Conclusion: Sketch-to-layout is established as a promising research direction, offering an intuitive constraint method that produces high-quality layouts while being more user-friendly than existing approaches.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)

Building linked spatio-temporal datasets from map time series is labor-intensive but essential for applications like dating buildings and analyzing environmental changes.

Method: Treats historical map images and time series as videos. For images, processes tiles as videos to leverage memory attention for contextual cues. For time series, introduces annotated building dataset and generates pseudo time series from single-year maps by simulating temporal transformations.

Result: MapSAM2 effectively learns temporal associations and accurately segments/link buildings in time series under limited supervision or using pseudo videos. Shows improved geometric accuracy for areal features.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses historical map segmentation challenges through video-based processing and few-shot adaptation, enabling efficient construction of spatio-temporal datasets with reduced annotation costs.

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

*Cesar H. Comin,Wesley N. Galvão*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VessShape is a method that generates synthetic 2D datasets with tubular geometries to instill shape bias in segmentation models, improving few-shot and zero-shot performance on real-world blood vessel datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels faces challenges due to limited annotated datasets and poor cross-domain generalization. CNNs tend to learn texture-based features rather than shape cues, limiting performance across different imaging modalities.

Method: Introduces VessShape methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets with procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with various foreground and background textures, encouraging models to learn shape cues over textures.

Result: Models pre-trained on VessShape achieve strong few-shot segmentation performance on real-world datasets, requiring only 4-10 samples for fine-tuning. The model also exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in unseen domains without target-specific training.

Conclusion: Pre-training with strong shape bias is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation, demonstrating the importance of geometric priors for robust medical image analysis.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models are limited to 2D imaging, while medical applications like PET/CT involve large 3D volumetric data with small, dispersed lesions and lengthy reports that require specialized handling.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with 11,000+ lesion-level descriptions and 3D segmentations from 5,000+ PET/CT exams using hybrid rule-based and LLM pipeline. Developed PETAR-4B model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation.

Conclusion: PETAR advances 3D medical vision-language understanding by enabling effective multimodal reasoning on volumetric medical data with improved report generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing

*Ilyass Moummad,Kawtar Zaher,Hervé Goëau,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CroVCA introduces a simple unified principle for learning binary codes using cross-view code alignment with a single binary cross-entropy loss and coding-rate maximization as anti-collapse regularizer, achieving state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale retrieval requires compact and discriminative representations. While foundation models provide powerful embeddings, nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers efficient alternatives but existing approaches have complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, and long training times.

Method: CroVCA uses cross-view code alignment principle with single binary cross-entropy loss for alignment and coding-rate maximization as anti-collapse regularizer. HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with final batch normalization layer, enforces balanced codes and can be used as probing head on frozen embeddings or adapt encoders via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU.

Conclusion: CroVCA demonstrates high efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability for large-scale retrieval through its simple unified approach to learning binary codes with fast training times and competitive performance.

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

### [70] [ANCHOR: Integrating Adversarial Training with Hard-mined Supervised Contrastive Learning for Robust Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27599)
*Samarup Bhattacharya,Anubhab Bhattacharya,Abir Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ANCHOR framework using supervised contrastive learning with hard positive mining to create robust neural networks against adversarial attacks by clustering embeddings of images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions together in embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where imperceptible changes to images cause wrong predictions. The gradients that help models learn can be exploited to create these attacks.

Method: Uses supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to learn representations where embeddings for images, their augmentations, and perturbed versions cluster together for same-class images while being separated from other classes.

Result: Achieves impressive results on CIFAR-10 for both clean and robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Combining adversarial guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance in deepfake detection and enables accurate source generator attribution.

Conclusion: Diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a

attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,

show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific

TL;DR: DUST is a dual-stream diffusion framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models by separately handling observation and action modalities while enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing, achieving significant performance gains in robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of jointly predicting next-state observations and action sequences in Vision-Language-Action models due to inherent modality differences, and improve robotic policy learning through world modeling.

Method: Proposes a multimodal diffusion transformer with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations for each modality, decoupled flow-matching loss, and joint sampling with test-time scaling where action and vision tokens evolve asynchronously.

Result: Achieves up to 6% gains over baselines on RoboCasa and GR-1 benchmarks, with test-time scaling providing additional 2-5% boost. Real-world Franka Research 3 tasks show 13% success rate improvement. Pre-training on BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains.

Conclusion: DUST effectively handles modality conflict in VLAs through dual-stream architecture and test-time scaling, demonstrating strong performance improvements in both simulation and real-world robotic tasks, with promising potential for large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

### [73] [NegoCollab: A Common Representation Negotiation Approach for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27647)
*Congzhang Shao,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Yue Hu,Danni Wang,Yilin Liu,Rui Pan,Bo Chen,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NegoCollab proposes a negotiated common representation approach for heterogeneous collaborative perception, addressing domain gaps between different agents' models through a negotiator that creates a common representation space with reduced inherent domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception causes domain gaps in shared features between agents using different fixed perception models, degrading performance. Existing methods using specific agent representations as common representations struggle with significant domain discrepancies.

Method: Introduces a negotiator during training to derive common representation from local representations of each modality's agent. Uses sender-receiver pairs for mutual feature transformation between local and common spaces. Employs structural, pragmatic, and distribution alignment losses for better alignment.

Result: The method effectively reduces inherent domain gaps with various local representations and enables full knowledge distillation from common representation to senders through comprehensive alignment supervision.

Conclusion: NegoCollab successfully addresses heterogeneous collaboration challenges by creating negotiated common representations that better accommodate agents with significant domain discrepancies, improving collaborative perception performance.

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) to address limitations of IoU and Wasserstein Distance in object detection, particularly for small objects. GCD provides scale invariance and joint optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tiny object detection datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IoU-based similarity metrics perform poorly on small objects due to sensitivity to positional deviations. While Wasserstein Distance was proposed as an alternative, it lacks scale invariance and has slow convergence due to independent optimization of center attributes.

Method: Proposed Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD) as a new similarity metric and loss function. GCD combines properties to achieve scale invariance and enables joint optimization of bounding box parameters through analytical gradient analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments on AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show GCD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Validation on MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets demonstrates GCD outperforms Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales.

Conclusion: GCD effectively addresses limitations of existing similarity metrics by providing scale invariance and joint optimization capabilities, leading to improved model localization performance and better generalization across different object scales.

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Conclusion: Deep denoising is established as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron

Conclusion: Sh-ViT improves robustness to occlusion and blur without requiring external modules, providing a practical solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,

enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate

outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on

*Xiangyu Fan,Zesong Qiu,Zhuguanyu Wu,Fanzhou Wang,Zhiqian Lin,Tianxiang Ren,Dahua Lin,Ruihao Gong,Lei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phased DMD is a multi-step distillation framework that combines phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts to improve distribution matching distillation, addressing limitations in one-step and multi-step approaches while preserving generation diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-step distilled models underperform on complex generative tasks due to limited model capacity, while multi-step distillation suffers from memory usage, computational depth, instability, and reduced generation diversity when using gradient truncation.

Method: Phased DMD uses progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals by dividing the SNR range into subintervals and progressively refining the model to higher SNR levels, combined with rigorous mathematical derivations for accurate training objectives.

Result: Experimental results show Phased DMD preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative capabilities when distilling large models like Qwen-Image (20B) and Wan2.2 (28B).

Conclusion: Phased DMD effectively bridges phase-wise distillation with Mixture-of-Experts, reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model capacity for complex generative tasks.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Motivation: To enable non-contact cardiac monitoring by reconstructing ECG signals from radar measurements, providing an unobtrusive alternative to traditional contact-based ECG monitoring.

Method: Uses a lifting wavelet network with learnable lifting wavelets, multi-resolution analysis and synthesis model, and introduces a multi-resolution STFT loss for temporal and spectral consistency with ground-truth ECG.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets in ECG reconstruction accuracy and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate variability), with interpretable multi-resolution feature decomposition.

Conclusion: LifWavNet establishes a robust framework for non-contact ECG measurement from radar signals, demonstrating superior performance and interpretability in cardiac monitoring applications.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A methodology using semantic frames to identify gender-based violence reports in e-medical records, achieving 0.726 precision on 21 million Brazilian Portuguese sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underreporting of gender-based violence in healthcare records by developing an automated detection system.

Method: Uses semantic frames to define fine-grained patterns and searches them in unstructured text from e-medical records, with manual evaluation by linguists.

Result: The methodology identified reports of violence with 0.726 precision across 21 million sentences from e-SUS APS.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, transparent, efficient, low-carbon, language-agnostic, and adaptable to other health surveillance contexts for ethical NLP use in public health.

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the
domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define
fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text
fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of
underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced
during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are
defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian
Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by
linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that
the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of
0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient,
low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted
to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical,
and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.

Abstract: Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition and
summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders for
Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can
significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact
downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first
challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six
teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of
approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In
this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking,
and participants' solutions.

### [81] [Semantically-Aware LLM Agent to Enhance Privacy in Conversational AI Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27016)
*Jayden Serenari,Stephen Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOPSIDED is a privacy framework that dynamically replaces sensitive PII in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms for LLM interactions, preserving context while protecting privacy, then automatically reverses the pseudonyms in responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concern over privacy leaks when users share sensitive personal data with conversational AI systems, as conversations may contain PII that could lead to security breaches or identity theft if exposed.

Method: A semantically-aware privacy agent that dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving contextual integrity, then automatically depseudonymizes the model's response.

Result: LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques while enhancing privacy, evaluated using real-world conversations from ShareGPT.

Conclusion: The framework successfully safeguards sensitive PII data when using remote LLMs without degrading response quality, unlike prior approaches.

Abstract: With the increasing use of conversational AI systems, there is growing
concern over privacy leaks, especially when users share sensitive personal data
in interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Conversations shared with
these models may contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which, if
exposed, could lead to security breaches or identity theft. To address this
challenge, we present the Local Optimizations for Pseudonymization with
Semantic Integrity Directed Entity Detection (LOPSIDED) framework, a
semantically-aware privacy agent designed to safeguard sensitive PII data when
using remote LLMs. Unlike prior work that often degrade response quality, our
approach dynamically replaces sensitive PII entities in user prompts with
semantically consistent pseudonyms, preserving the contextual integrity of
conversations. Once the model generates its response, the pseudonyms are
automatically depseudonymized, ensuring the user receives an accurate,
privacy-preserving output. We evaluate our approach using real-world
conversations sourced from ShareGPT, which we further augment and annotate to
assess whether named entities are contextually relevant to the model's
response. Our results show that LOPSIDED reduces semantic utility errors by a
factor of 5 compared to baseline techniques, all while enhancing privacy.

### [82] [Kad: A Framework for Proxy-based Test-time Alignment with Knapsack Approximation Deferral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27017)
*Ayoub Hammal,Pierre Zweigenbaum,Caio Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proxy-based test-time alignment method using guidance from a small aligned model to reduce computational costs of aligning large language models, treating token deferral as a 0-1 knapsack problem with primal and dual approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require expensive alignment procedures after pre-training, and these costs increase prohibitively as models scale up in size. The motivation is to develop a cost-effective alignment approach that leverages smaller aligned models.

Method: Token-specific cascading method where deferral decisions are formulated as a 0-1 knapsack problem, with derived primal and dual approximations for optimal deferral decisions using guidance from a small aligned proxy model.

Result: Experimental results show benefits in both task performance and speculative decoding speed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed alignment approach.

Conclusion: The proposed proxy-based test-time alignment method provides an efficient alternative to costly alignment procedures for large language models, achieving good performance while reducing computational expenses.

Abstract: Several previous works concluded that the largest part of generation
capabilities of large language models (LLM) are learned (early) during
pre-training. However, LLMs still require further alignment to adhere to
downstream task requirements and stylistic preferences, among other desired
properties. As LLMs continue to scale in terms of size, the computational cost
of alignment procedures increase prohibitively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach to circumvent these costs via proxy-based test-time alignment,
i.e. using guidance from a small aligned model. Our approach can be described
as token-specific cascading method, where the token-specific deferral rule is
reduced to 0-1 knapsack problem. In this setting, we derive primal and dual
approximations of the optimal deferral decision. We experimentally show the
benefits of our method both in task performance and speculative decoding speed.

### [83] [Elastic Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27037)
*Shang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELM is a neural architecture search method that creates compact language models through flexible search spaces and knowledge distillation, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory concerns of large pre-trained language models by developing more efficient and compact models.

Method: Extends NAS with flexible search spaces using efficient transformer blocks, dynamic modules for dimension/head adjustment, and novel knowledge distillation losses.

Result: ELM-discovered models significantly outperform existing methods on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: ELM provides an effective approach for creating efficient language models through improved neural architecture search techniques.

Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory
requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns.
Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model
(ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact
language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible
search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for
dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency
and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and
effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge
distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in
order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the
search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language
modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly
outperform existing methods.

### [84] [Dataset Creation and Baseline Models for Sexism Detection in Hausa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27038)
*Fatima Adam Muhammad,Shamsuddeen Muhammad Hassan,Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first Hausa sexism detection dataset developed through community engagement and qualitative coding, and experiments with machine learning models to detect sexism in this low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and thrives on online platforms, but computational detection approaches are limited in low-resource languages like Hausa due to limited linguistic resources and cultural differences in how sexism is expressed.

Method: Developed the first Hausa sexism detection dataset through community engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. Conducted a two-stage user study with native speakers (n=66) to understand cultural nuances. Experimented with traditional machine learning classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models, evaluating few-shot learning effectiveness.

Result: Findings highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many false positives in such cases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the importance of cultural context in sexism detection for low-resource languages and identifies specific linguistic challenges that need to be addressed in future work.

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating
stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable
various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism
detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism
detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited
in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural
differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces
the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community
engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and
linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving
native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday
discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning
classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the
effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings
highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with
clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many
false positives in such cases.

### [86] [Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049)
*Ponrawee Prasertsom,Andrea Silvi,Jennifer Culbertson,Moa Johansson,Devdatt Dubhashi,Kenny Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that recursive numeral systems optimize regularity and processing complexity rather than just lexicon size vs morphosyntactic complexity trade-off, using Minimum Description Length to show natural systems differ from unnatural ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work failed to explain why only natural-language-like numeral systems optimize the lexicon-complexity trade-off, relying on ad-hoc constraints. The authors identify that regularity - a key aspect of human grammars - was neglected.

Method: The authors use Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach to measure regularity and processing complexity in recursive numeral systems, comparing natural systems with unnatural but mathematically possible ones.

Result: MDL-based measures successfully distinguish natural numeral systems from unnatural ones, including previously identified "optimal" systems, and show that previous ad-hoc constraints naturally emerge from regularity considerations.

Conclusion: Regularity must be incorporated when measuring optimality in language systems, as it better explains why natural numeral systems are efficient and distinguishes them from unnatural alternatives.

Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the
trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c
and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems
optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied
on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025).
Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has
neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars
in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we
propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with
regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our
MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the
key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible
ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and
that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from
regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across
sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in
language.

### [87] [VISTA Score: Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27052)
*Ashley Lewis,Andrew Perrault,Eric Fosler-Lussier,Michael White*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VISTA is a new framework for evaluating conversational factuality in multi-turn dialogues through claim-level verification and sequential consistency tracking, outperforming existing methods like FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a major obstacle for conversational AI systems in factual settings. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue.

Method: VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted, lacking evidence, or abstaining).

Result: Across eight large language models and four dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge baselines. Human evaluation confirms improved annotator agreement.

Conclusion: By modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Hallucination--defined here as generating statements unsupported or
contradicted by available evidence or conversational context--remains a major
obstacle to deploying conversational AI systems in settings that demand factual
reliability. Existing metrics either evaluate isolated responses or treat
unverifiable content as errors, limiting their use for multi-turn dialogue. We
introduce VISTA (Verification In Sequential Turn-based Assessment), a framework
for evaluating conversational factuality through claim-level verification and
sequential consistency tracking. VISTA decomposes each assistant turn into
atomic factual claims, verifies them against trusted sources and dialogue
history, and categorizes unverifiable statements (subjective, contradicted,
lacking evidence, or abstaining). Across eight large language models and four
dialogue factuality benchmarks (AIS, BEGIN, FAITHDIAL, and FADE), VISTA
substantially improves hallucination detection over FACTSCORE and LLM-as-Judge
baselines. Human evaluation confirms that VISTA's decomposition improves
annotator agreement and reveals inconsistencies in existing benchmarks. By
modeling factuality as a dynamic property of conversation, VISTA offers a more
transparent, human-aligned measure of truthfulness in dialogue systems.

*Xiaofan Guo,Yaxuan Luan,Yue Kang,Xiangchen Song,Jinxu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a confidence control method for retrieval-augmented generation that combines multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation to improve coverage, stability, and reliability in complex knowledge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results, and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex knowledge environments.

Method: Builds hierarchical memory structure with multi-granularity knowledge representations, enables dynamic indexing from local to global context, and introduces uncertainty estimation to filter low-confidence paths during generation with optimization objective combining generation loss, entropy constraints, and variance regularization.

Result: Achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency across different scenarios, demonstrating stability and robustness.

Conclusion: Provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented generation and offers practical evidence for improving reliability and controllability of large models in complex contexts through multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.

Abstract: This paper addresses the issues of insufficient coverage, unstable results,
and limited reliability in retrieval-augmented generation under complex
knowledge environments, and proposes a confidence control method that
integrates multi-granularity memory indexing with uncertainty estimation. The
method builds a hierarchical memory structure that divides knowledge
representations into different levels of granularity, enabling dynamic indexing
and retrieval from local details to global context, and thus establishing
closer semantic connections between retrieval and generation. On this basis, an
uncertainty estimation mechanism is introduced to explicitly constrain and
filter low-confidence paths during the generation process, allowing the model
to maintain information coverage while effectively suppressing noise and false
content. The overall optimization objective consists of generation loss,
entropy constraints, and variance regularization, forming a unified confidence
control framework. In the experiments, comprehensive sensitivity tests and
comparative analyses were designed, covering hyperparameters, environmental
conditions, and data structures, to verify the stability and robustness of the
proposed method across different scenarios. The results show that the method
achieves superior performance over existing models in QA accuracy, retrieval
recall, ranking quality, and factual consistency, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining multi-granularity indexing with confidence control.
This study not only provides a new technical pathway for retrieval-augmented
generation but also offers practical evidence for improving the reliability and
controllability of large models in complex contexts.

### [89] [Detecting Data Contamination in LLMs via In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27055)
*Michał Zawalski,Meriem Boubdir,Klaudia Bałazy,Besmira Nushi,Pablo Ribalta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoDeC is a practical method for detecting training data contamination in LLMs by measuring how in-context learning affects model performance, distinguishing memorized data from unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting when language models have been trained on evaluation datasets, which can artificially inflate benchmark performance.

Method: Measures how in-context learning affects model confidence - unseen datasets typically get confidence boosts while memorized datasets may show reduced confidence due to disrupted memorization patterns.

Result: Produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and unseen datasets, revealing strong evidence of memorization in open-weight models with undisclosed training corpora.

Conclusion: CoDeC is an effective, automated, model- and dataset-agnostic method that can be easily integrated with benchmark evaluations to detect data contamination.

Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and
accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large
language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and
data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning
affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost
confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of
training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC
produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and
unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight
models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and
both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark
evaluations.

*Jiasen Zheng,Huajun Zhang,Xu Yan,Ran Hao,Chong Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fine-tuning method combining contrastive distillation and noise-robust training to improve safety alignment and robustness in large language models, achieving superior performance in knowledge transfer and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in safety alignment and robustness of large-scale language models by developing a method that enhances semantic consistency and maintains stable predictions under noisy inputs.

Method: Freezes the backbone model and transfers teacher model knowledge boundaries through distillation, while introducing noise perturbations and robust optimization constraints during training. Uses a unified optimization objective with distillation loss, robustness loss, and regularization.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness, and overall safety, achieving best performance across several key metrics. Validated through experiments on distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis, and noise/distribution shift impacts.

Conclusion: Enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and provides a new solution for building safer and more trustworthy alignment mechanisms in language models.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large-scale language models in safety
alignment and robustness by proposing a fine-tuning method that combines
contrastive distillation with noise-robust training. The method freezes the
backbone model and transfers the knowledge boundaries of the teacher model to
the student model through distillation, thereby improving semantic consistency
and alignment accuracy. At the same time, noise perturbations and robust
optimization constraints are introduced during training to ensure that the
model maintains stable predictive outputs under noisy and uncertain inputs. The
overall framework consists of distillation loss, robustness loss, and a
regularization term, forming a unified optimization objective that balances
alignment ability with resistance to interference. To systematically validate
its effectiveness, the study designs experiments from multiple perspectives,
including distillation weight sensitivity, stability analysis under computation
budgets and mixed-precision environments, and the impact of data noise and
distribution shifts on model performance. Results show that the method
significantly outperforms existing baselines in knowledge transfer, robustness,
and overall safety, achieving the best performance across several key metrics.
This work not only enriches the theoretical system of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning but also provides a new solution for building safer and more
trustworthy alignment mechanisms.

### [91] [Characterizing Selective Refusal Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27087)
*Adel Khorramrouz,Sharon Levy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM safety guardrails can introduce selective refusal bias, disproportionately refusing to generate harmful content for certain demographic groups over others, creating new biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how safety measures in LLMs may inadvertently create or reflect biases by selectively refusing to generate harmful content for different demographic groups.

Method: Analyzed refusal rates across targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups, examined types of LLM responses, and measured length of generated refusals. Also conducted indirect attacks targeting previously refused groups.

Result: Found evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion attributes. Safety guardrails show unequal protection across different demographic groups.

Conclusion: There is a need for more equitable and robust performance in safety guardrails to ensure fair protection across all demographic groups without introducing new biases.

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models(LLMs) are developed to prevent
malicious users from generating toxic content at a large scale. However, these
measures can inadvertently introduce or reflect new biases, as LLMs may refuse
to generate harmful content targeting some demographic groups and not others.
We explore this selective refusal bias in LLM guardrails through the lens of
refusal rates of targeted individual and intersectional demographic groups,
types of LLM responses, and length of generated refusals. Our results show
evidence of selective refusal bias across gender, sexual orientation,
nationality, and religion attributes. This leads us to investigate additional
safety implications via an indirect attack, where we target previously refused
groups. Our findings emphasize the need for more equitable and robust
performance in safety guardrails across demographic groups.

### [92] [Rating Roulette: Self-Inconsistency in LLM-As-A-Judge Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27106)
*Rajarshi Haldar,Julia Hockenmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based evaluation of natural language generation has low intra-rater reliability, making scores inconsistent across different runs, which challenges the reliability of LLM judges despite their alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As NLG becomes more widely adopted, proper assessment is challenging. While LLMs align better with human preferences than traditional metrics, their reliability as evaluators needs investigation due to potential inconsistency in scoring.

Method: Experiments were conducted to measure the intra-rater reliability of LLM judges across different NLG tasks and benchmarks, analyzing score variance across multiple runs.

Result: LLM judges show low intra-rater reliability in assigned scores across different runs, making their ratings inconsistent and sometimes arbitrary, which complicates assessing the quality of their judgments.

Conclusion: Despite inconsistency issues, judicious use of LLM judges following proper guidelines may still be useful for NLG evaluation, though their reliability limitations must be acknowledged.

Abstract: As Natural Language Generation (NLG) continues to be widely adopted, properly
assessing it has become quite difficult. Lately, using large language models
(LLMs) for evaluating these generations has gained traction, as they tend to
align more closely with human preferences than conventional n-gram or
embedding-based metrics. In our experiments, we show that LLM judges have low
intra-rater reliability in their assigned scores across different runs. This
variance makes their ratings inconsistent, almost arbitrary in the worst case,
making it difficult to measure how good their judgments actually are. We
quantify this inconsistency across different NLG tasks and benchmarks and see
if judicious use of LLM judges can still be useful following proper guidelines.

*Andy Yang,Anej Svete,Jiaoda Li,Anthony Widjaja Lin,Jonathan Rawski,Ryan Cotterell,David Chiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the expressivity of transformer language models (which generate strings autoregressively and probabilistically) rather than treating them as language recognizers, showing that autoregressive and probabilistic aspects can increase expressivity and break equivalences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers (accept/reject strings), but transformers are primarily used in practice as language models that generate strings autoregressively and probabilistically. The authors aim to characterize what probability distributions transformer language models can actually express.

Method: The authors analyze the expressivity of transformer language models by examining how making transformer language recognizers autoregressive can increase expressivity, and how making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the non-probabilistic case.

Result: The research shows that making transformer language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity, and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the non-probabilistic case.

Conclusion: The paper provides a characterization of the probability distributions that transformer language models can express, teasing apart what functions transformers are capable of expressing in their most common use-case as language models rather than as language recognizers.

Abstract: Most expressivity results for transformers treat them as language recognizers
(which accept or reject strings), and not as they are used in practice, as
language models (which generate strings autoregressively and
probabilistically). Here, we characterize the probability distributions that
transformer language models can express. We show that making transformer
language recognizers autoregressive can sometimes increase their expressivity,
and that making them probabilistic can break equivalences that hold in the
non-probabilistic case. Our overall contribution is to tease apart what
functions transformers are capable of expressing, in their most common use-case
as language models.

*Mason Shipton,York Hay Ng,Aditya Khan,Phuong Hanh Hoang,Xiang Lu,A. Seza Doğruöz,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper extends the URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base by adding script vectors for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710 languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages, reducing feature sparsity and improving cross-lingual transfer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: URIEL+ suffers from data sparsity issues including missing feature types, incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage, which limits its usefulness for cross-lingual transfer, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: Three main extensions: 1) Introducing script vectors to represent writing system properties for 7,488 languages, 2) Integrating Glottolog to add 18,710 additional languages, 3) Expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by propagating typological and script features across genealogies.

Result: Reduced feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increased language coverage by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), improved imputation quality metrics by up to 33%, and showed performance gains up to 6% in cross-lingual transfer tasks for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The extensions make URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research, addressing data sparsity issues and improving its utility for cross-lingual transfer, particularly benefiting low-resource languages.

Abstract: The URIEL+ linguistic knowledge base supports multilingual research by
encoding languages through geographic, genetic, and typological vectors.
However, data sparsity remains prevalent, in the form of missing feature types,
incomplete language entries, and limited genealogical coverage. This limits the
usefulness of URIEL+ in cross-lingual transfer, particularly for supporting
low-resource languages. To address this sparsity, this paper extends URIEL+
with three contributions: introducing script vectors to represent writing
system properties for 7,488 languages, integrating Glottolog to add 18,710
additional languages, and expanding lineage imputation for 26,449 languages by
propagating typological and script features across genealogies. These additions
reduce feature sparsity by 14% for script vectors, increase language coverage
by up to 19,015 languages (1,007%), and improve imputation quality metrics by
up to 33%. Our benchmark on cross-lingual transfer tasks (oriented around
low-resource languages) shows occasionally divergent performance compared to
URIEL+, with performance gains up to 6% in certain setups. Our advances make
URIEL+ more complete and inclusive for multilingual research.

### [95] [MemeArena: Automating Context-Aware Unbiased Evaluation of Harmfulness Understanding for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27196)
*Zixin Chen,Hongzhan Lin,Kaixin Li,Ziyang Luo,Yayue Deng,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemeArena is an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides context-aware and unbiased assessment for multimodal Large Language Models' understanding of multimodal harmfulness in memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation approaches focus mainly on binary classification accuracy, which fails to capture the nuanced interpretation of harmfulness across diverse contexts in multimodal content like memes.

Method: The framework simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks, elicits perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs, and integrates varied viewpoints through consensus among evaluators to enable fair comparisons.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework effectively reduces evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences.

Conclusion: MemeArena offers valuable insights for reliable and comprehensive evaluation of mLLMs in multimodal harmfulness understanding, addressing limitations of current binary classification approaches.

Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal
harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs'
detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect
the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In
this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation
framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs'
understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates
diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit
perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and
reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons
of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of
judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences,
offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in
multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available

*Yulin Ou,Yu Wang,Yang Xu,Hendrik Buschmeier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS) to detect periodicity patterns in natural language information encoding, finding significant periodic structures beyond typical text units like sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the degree of periodicity in natural language's encoded information, building on recent theoretical advances in information density.

Method: Developed AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS) using canonical periodicity detection algorithms to identify significant periods in surprisal sequences of single documents.

Result: Found considerable proportion of human language exhibits strong periodicity patterns, including new periods outside typical structural units like sentence boundaries, confirmed via harmonic regression modeling.

Conclusion: Periodicity in language information is a joint outcome from structured factors and longer-distance driving factors; APS method shows potential for LLM-generation detection.

Abstract: Recent theoretical advancement of information density in natural language has
brought the following question on desk: To what degree does natural language
exhibit periodicity pattern in its encoded information? We address this
question by introducing a new method called AutoPeriod of Surprisal (APS). APS
adopts a canonical periodicity detection algorithm and is able to identify any
significant periods that exist in the surprisal sequence of a single document.
By applying the algorithm to a set of corpora, we have obtained the following
interesting results: Firstly, a considerable proportion of human language
demonstrates a strong pattern of periodicity in information; Secondly, new
periods that are outside the distributions of typical structural units in text
(e.g., sentence boundaries, elementary discourse units, etc.) are found and
further confirmed via harmonic regression modeling. We conclude that the
periodicity of information in language is a joint outcome from both structured
factors and other driving factors that take effect at longer distances. The
advantages of our periodicity detection method and its potentials in
LLM-generation detection are further discussed.

*Mohammad Tavakoli,Alireza Salemi,Carrie Ye,Mohamed Abdalla,Hamed Zamani,J Ross Mitchell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces BEAM, a new benchmark for evaluating long-term memory in LLMs using automatically generated long conversations, and proposes LIGHT, a framework with three memory systems that significantly improves performance on long-context reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' long-term memory abilities are inadequate - they lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall tasks, making it difficult to properly assess models' capabilities in conversational settings requiring long-context reasoning.

Method: 1) Created BEAM benchmark with 100 automatically generated long conversations (up to 10M tokens) and 2,000 validated questions testing various memory abilities. 2) Proposed LIGHT framework with three complementary memory systems: long-term episodic memory, short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts.

Result: Experiments on BEAM showed that even LLMs with 1M token context windows struggle as dialogues lengthen. LIGHT consistently improved performance across various models, achieving 3.5%-12.69% average improvement over strongest baselines. Ablation study confirmed each memory component's contribution.

Conclusion: The proposed LIGHT framework effectively addresses long-term memory challenges in LLMs, demonstrating significant performance improvements on the new BEAM benchmark, which provides a more comprehensive evaluation of memory abilities in conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that
require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in
conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often
lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple
recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these
challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating
long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,
accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.
From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and
2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose
LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three
complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working
memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on
BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without
retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT
consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average
improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the
backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each
memory component.

*Rajan Agarwal,Aarush Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLINK is a compute-efficient method that improves LLM performance on low-resource non-Latin scripts by aligning multilingual sentence embeddings to the decoder's latent space without changing tokenizers or retraining the decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-tuned LLMs underperform on low-resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual coupling, creating a need for efficient solutions that don't require extensive retraining.

Method: Align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to decoder's latent embedding space via lightweight contrastive projector, expand vector into K soft slots, and train with minimal adapters for frozen decoder consumption.

Result: LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&A evaluations, with reduced tokenization inflation and stronger cross-lingual alignment.

Conclusion: Treating low resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs, though residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity remain.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource,
non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual
coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English
Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an
instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the
decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder
to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a
lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft
slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the
signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3%
preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged
Q&A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced
tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the
model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource
languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual
alignment in lightweight LLMs.

TL;DR: MedCalc-Eval is the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs' medical calculation abilities, featuring 700+ tasks across equation-based and rule-based scoring systems. The authors also developed MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment that achieved state-of-the-art results when fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model.


<details>

Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in medicine focus on question answering and descriptive reasoning but overlook quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Current datasets like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and don't reflect real-world computational scenarios.

Method: Created MedCalc-Eval benchmark with 700+ tasks across equation-based calculations (e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar, Glasgow Coma Scale). Developed MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment built on InternBootcamp framework for multi-step clinical reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: MedCalc-Eval provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for medical calculation abilities in LLMs. While significant progress was made, remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and contextual understanding. The code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks

  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical

### [100] [Why Do Multilingual Reasoning Gaps Emerge in Reasoning Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27269)
*Deokhyung Kang,Seonjeong Hwang,Daehui Kim,Hyounghun Kim,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies that the multilingual reasoning gap in RLMs stems from failures in language understanding, proposes methods to detect these failures, and introduces Selective Translation to mitigate the gap while minimizing translation usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the multilingual reasoning gap in reasoning language models, where performance is better in high-resource languages than low-resource ones, by identifying its underlying causes.

Method: The authors show that understanding failures cause the gap, evaluate detection methods (finding supervised approaches work best), and propose Selective Translation that translates multilingual inputs to English only when understanding failures are detected.

Result: Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs.

Conclusion: Understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing insight into its origin and a path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap,
performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While
recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely
unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual
reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's
inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant
language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to
examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could
help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range
of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be
identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we
propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates
the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is
detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the
multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while
using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates
that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning
gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into
its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

### [101] [A Unified Representation Underlying the Judgment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27328)
*Yi-Long Lu,Jiajun Song,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs use a unified Valence-Assent Axis (VAA) that combines evaluative judgments and factual assent, creating systematic biases where reasoning serves to justify predetermined conclusions rather than seek truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether intelligence relies on specialized modules or unified systems, specifically investigating if LLMs' decodable neural representations are truly independent or part of a convergent architecture.

Method: Analyzed diverse LLMs to identify dominant dimensions in evaluative judgments, conducted direct interventions on the identified Valence-Assent Axis (VAA), and examined how this axis controls generative processes.

Result: Found that the VAA jointly encodes subjective valence and factual assent, creating a dependency where reasoning is subordinated to justify evaluative states even at the cost of accuracy, leading to systematic bias and hallucination.

Conclusion: LLMs employ a convergent architecture where a unified evaluative representation systematically undermines faithful reasoning by prioritizing coherent judgment over impartial inference, explaining systemic bias and hallucination.

Abstract: A central architectural question for both biological and artificial
intelligence is whether judgment relies on specialized modules or a unified,
domain-general resource. While the discovery of decodable neural
representations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has
suggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly
independent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a
convergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse
evaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the
Valence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence ("what
is good") and the model's assent to factual claims ("what is true"). Through
direct interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical
dependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative
process to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at
the cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination
of reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward
goal-directed justification. Our discovery offers a mechanistic account for
systemic bias and hallucination, revealing how an architecture that promotes
coherent judgment can systematically undermine faithful reasoning.

### [102] [TransAlign: Machine Translation Encoders are Strong Word Aligners, Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27337)
*Benedikt Ebing,Christian Goldschmied,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransAlign is a novel word alignment method using MT model encoders that outperforms existing approaches for cross-lingual transfer in token classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current word alignment methods for cross-lingual transfer rely on multilingual word aligners from encoder models like mBERT or LaBSE, while MT models' potential for word alignment remains underexplored despite their obvious relevance to the task.

Method: Proposed TransAlign, which utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual machine translation model for word alignment, rather than relying on cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures.

Result: TransAlign achieves strong word alignment performance and substantially outperforms popular word alignment methods and state-of-the-art non-word-alignment-based label projection methods in machine translation-based cross-lingual transfer for token classification.

Conclusion: The encoder of massively multilingual MT models can be effectively leveraged for word alignment, providing superior performance for cross-lingual transfer in token classification tasks compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: In the absence of sizable training data for most world languages and NLP
tasks, translation-based strategies such as translate-test -- evaluating on
noisy source language data translated from the target language -- and
translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the
source language -- have been established as competitive approaches for
cross-lingual transfer (XLT). For token classification tasks, these strategies
require label projection: mapping the labels from each token in the original
sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. To this end, it is common to
leverage multilingual word aligners (WAs) derived from encoder language models
such as mBERT or LaBSE. Despite obvious associations between machine
translation (MT) and WA, research on extracting alignments with MT models is
largely limited to exploiting cross-attention in encoder-decoder architectures,
yielding poor WA results. In this work, in contrast, we propose TransAlign, a
novel word aligner that utilizes the encoder of a massively multilingual MT
model. We show that TransAlign not only achieves strong WA performance but
substantially outperforms popular WA and state-of-the-art non-WA-based label
projection methods in MT-based XLT for token classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThoughtProbe is an inference-time framework that uses LLMs' hidden reasoning features to guide tree-structured exploration, employing classifiers to prioritize candidates and branch aggregation to find optimal answers, achieving significant improvements in arithmetic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LLM reasoning performance by leveraging hidden reasoning features as discriminative signals rather than manipulating representations, enabling more efficient exploration of reasoning chains.

Method: Uses tree-structured response space exploration with classifiers for scoring/ranking candidates, then aggregates answers from all branches by marginalizing over CoT scores to identify optimal answers.

Result: Achieved significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning benchmarks through comprehensive exploration that covers and identifies valid reasoning chains.

Conclusion: ThoughtProbe effectively leverages LLM hidden features for guided reasoning exploration and aggregation, demonstrating substantial performance gains in arithmetic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces ThoughtProbe, a novel inference time framework that
leverages the hidden reasoning features of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
improve their reasoning performance. Unlike previous works that manipulate the
hidden representations to steer LLM generation, we harness them as
discriminative signals to guide the tree structured response space exploration.
In each node expansion, a classifier serves as a scoring and ranking mechanism
that efficiently allocates computational resources by prioritizing higher score
candidates for continuation. After completing the tree expansion, we collect
answers from all branches to form a candidate answer pool. We then propose a
branch aggregation method that marginalizes over all supporting branches by
aggregating their CoT scores, thereby identifying the optimal answer from the
pool. Experimental results show that our framework's comprehensive exploration
not only covers valid reasoning chains but also effectively identifies them,
achieving significant improvements across multiple arithmetic reasoning
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IntAttn-Edit is a knowledge editing method that jointly updates both MLP and attention modules in LLMs using a knowledge balancing strategy, outperforming prior methods that focused only on MLP modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods primarily focus on MLP modules while ignoring attention modules, leading to residual outdated knowledge and limited editing effectiveness. Attention modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage, especially in earlier layers.

Method: Extends associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules using a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes proportional to each module's contribution to knowledge storage.

Result: Achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods on standard benchmarks. The balancing strategy maintains optimal editing performance across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Jointly updating both MLP and attention modules with proportional allocation based on their knowledge storage contributions significantly improves knowledge editing effectiveness in LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual
knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge
storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing
methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are
often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other
components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing.
This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing
effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on
advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual
knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these
insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory
paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a
knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to
each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on
standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better
generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further
analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an
optimal range across diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI agent systems rely on external memory databases but suffer from memory redundancy, staleness, and poor memory-context integration due to ineffective memory updates during interaction.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian-inspired memory update algorithm using memory entropy concept, enabling autonomous maintenance of dynamically updated memory vector database by minimizing global entropy.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies validate the Bayesian update mechanism's effectiveness in reducing memory bloat.

Conclusion: The work provides new insights into designing long-term memory systems for personalized AI agents, with the proposed system successfully addressing key memory management challenges.

Abstract: Advances in large language models are making personalized AI agents a new
research focus. While current agent systems primarily rely on personalized
external memory databases to deliver customized experiences, they face
challenges such as memory redundancy, memory staleness, and poor memory-context
integration, largely due to the lack of effective memory updates during
interaction. To tackle these issues, we propose a new memory management system
designed for affective scenarios. Our approach employs a Bayesian-inspired
memory update algorithm with the concept of memory entropy, enabling the agent
to autonomously maintain a dynamically updated memory vector database by
minimizing global entropy to provide more personalized services. To better
evaluate the system's effectiveness in this context, we propose DABench, a
benchmark focusing on emotional expression and emotional change toward objects.
Experimental results demonstrate that, our system achieves superior performance
in personalization, logical coherence, and accuracy. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the Bayesian-inspired update mechanism in
alleviating memory bloat. Our work offers new insights into the design of
long-term memory systems.

Motivation: To find neural network structures with better translation results by searching optimal combinations of encoder and decoder architectures with different multihead attention computation ways.

Method: Neural architecture search based on Transformer architecture, using multi-objective genetic algorithm to iteratively improve neural networks, with BLEU scores and perplexity as evaluation metrics.

Result: The searched neural network structures outperform all baseline models, and using perplexity as auxiliary metric finds better models than using only BLEU score.

Conclusion: The proposed neural architecture search method with multi-objective optimization using both BLEU and perplexity metrics effectively discovers superior Transformer architectures for machine translation tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer
architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for
different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for
neural network structures with better translation results, we considered
perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to
BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the
population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show
that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the
baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric
can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation

*Xuan Gong,Senmiao Wang,Hanbo Huang,Ruoyu Sun,Shiyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VCORE introduces a variance-controlled optimization-based reweighting framework that adaptively allocates supervision across tokens in chain-of-thought reasoning, outperforming existing methods and improving generalization in mathematical and coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally in chain-of-thought reasoning, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions, which leads to misallocated supervision and weak generalization in complex reasoning tasks.

Method: VCORE reformulates chain-of-thought supervision as a constrained optimization problem, enabling principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens through an optimization-theoretic perspective.

Result: VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods, achieving substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks across in-domain and out-of-domain settings using Qwen3 series and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct models.

Conclusion: VCORE provides more effective supervision for chain-of-thought reasoning and serves as a better initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a stronger foundation for advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has
emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all
tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning
trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak
generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address
this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled
\textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled
framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization
problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a
principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby
aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning
generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently
outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on
mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B,
32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more
effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a
stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code
will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored potential for biases in reward models trained on publicly available preference datasets, particularly focusing on prefix bias - systematic shifts in model preferences triggered by minor query prefix variations.

Method: The authors introduce novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias, conduct comprehensive evaluation across diverse open-source preference datasets and reward model architectures, and propose a data augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases.

Result: The study reveals significant biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions, demonstrating susceptibility to prefix bias regardless of the underlying model architecture. The proposed data augmentation strategy shows effectiveness in reducing the impact of prefix bias.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical need for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

### [110] [Diffuse Thinking: Exploring Diffusion Language Models as Efficient Thought Proposers for Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27469)
*Chenyang Shao,Sijian Ren,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A collaborative reasoning framework that uses diffusion language models (DLMs) to generate diverse intermediate thoughts efficiently and large language models (LLMs) to evaluate them, addressing the computational inefficiency of LLMs' autoregressive generation in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning capabilities but suffer from sub-optimal scaling with test-time computation due to their autoregressive generation paradigm, requiring excessive computational overhead for marginal performance gains. DLMs can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising, offering a solution to reduce computational burden while maintaining reasoning quality.

Method: Proposes a collaborative framework where DLMs generate candidate intermediate thoughts efficiently through parallel denoising in a single forward pass, and LLMs evaluate the quality of these thoughts, combining the strengths of both model types.

Result: Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, showing the framework's effectiveness in achieving high reasoning accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: The collaborative reasoning framework offers a promising direction for efficient reasoning in language models, leveraging DLMs' sampling efficiency and LLMs' evaluation capabilities to overcome the limitations of autoregressive generation in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have witnessed remarkable
advancements, with the test-time scaling law consistently enhancing the
reasoning capabilities. Through systematic evaluation and exploration of a
diverse spectrum of intermediate thoughts, LLMs demonstrate the potential to
generate deliberate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing reasoning
accuracy. However, LLMs' autoregressive generation paradigm results in
reasoning performance scaling sub-optimally with test-time computation, often
requiring excessive computational overhead to propose thoughts while yielding
only marginal performance gains. In contrast, diffusion language models (DLMs)
can efficiently produce diverse samples through parallel denoising in a single
forward pass, inspiring us to leverage them for proposing intermediate
thoughts, thereby alleviating the computational burden associated with
autoregressive generation while maintaining quality. In this work, we propose
an efficient collaborative reasoning framework, leveraging DLMs to generate
candidate thoughts and LLMs to evaluate their quality. Experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance
in complex reasoning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research.

TL;DR: This study compares computational embeddings (GloVe vs BERT) with human semantic judgments for English compound words, finding BERT better captures compositional semantics and predictability is key for semantic transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well computational embeddings align with human semantic judgments in processing English compound words, specifically comparing static vs contextualized embeddings.

Method: Compared GloVe and BERT embeddings against human ratings of lexeme meaning dominance and semantic transparency using association strength, frequency, and predictability measures, analyzed via Spearman correlation and regression.

Result: BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than GloVe, and predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic transparency in both human and model data.

Conclusion: The findings advance computational psycholinguistics by clarifying factors driving compound word processing and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

Abstract: This study investigates how well computational embeddings align with human
semantic judgments in the processing of English compound words. We compare
static word vectors (GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT) against human
ratings of lexeme meaning dominance (LMD) and semantic transparency (ST) drawn
from a psycholinguistic dataset. Using measures of association strength
(Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus), frequency (BNC), and predictability (LaDEC),
we compute embedding-derived LMD and ST metrics and assess their relationships
with human judgments via Spearmans correlation and regression analyses. Our
results show that BERT embeddings better capture compositional semantics than
GloVe, and that predictability ratings are strong predictors of semantic
transparency in both human and model data. These findings advance computational
psycholinguistics by clarifying the factors that drive compound word processing
and offering insights into embedding-based semantic modeling.

*Mahi Aminu,Chisom Chibuike,Fatimo Adebanjo,Omokolade Awosanya,Samuel Oyeneye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines two causal domain generalization techniques for low-resource NLP tasks: causal data augmentation for sentiment classification and invariant causal representation learning for multilingual sentiment analysis, both showing improved robustness to distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models often fail in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, especially in low-resource settings with data scarcity and limited domain diversity. Domain generalization approaches aim to learn invariant features across domains using causal mechanisms.

Method: Two approaches were investigated: 1) Causal data augmentation (CDA) that generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious correlations, applied to sentiment classification on NaijaSenti Twitter corpus; 2) Invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) using DINER framework adapted to multilingual setting for aspect-based sentiment analysis.

Result: Both approaches enhanced robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data augmentation yielded consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improved out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, though with varying gains across languages.

Conclusion: Causal domain generalization techniques, including counterfactual data augmentation and invariant causal representation learning, effectively improve model robustness to distribution shifts in low-resource natural language tasks, demonstrating their practical value for real-world applications.

Abstract: Machine learning models typically assume that training and test data follow
the same distribution, an assumption that often fails in real-world scenarios
due to distribution shifts. This issue is especially pronounced in low-resource
settings, where data scarcity and limited domain diversity hinder robust
generalization. Domain generalization (DG) approaches address this challenge by
learning features that remain invariant across domains, often using causal
mechanisms to improve model robustness. In this study, we examine two distinct
causal DG techniques in low-resource natural language tasks. First, we
investigate a causal data augmentation (CDA) approach that automatically
generates counterfactual examples to improve robustness to spurious
correlations. We apply this method to sentiment classification on the
NaijaSenti Twitter corpus, expanding the training data with semantically
equivalent paraphrases to simulate controlled distribution shifts. Second, we
explore an invariant causal representation learning (ICRL) approach using the
DINER framework, originally proposed for debiasing aspect-based sentiment
analysis. We adapt DINER to a multilingual setting. Our findings demonstrate
that both approaches enhance robustness to unseen domains: counterfactual data
augmentation yields consistent cross-domain accuracy gains in sentiment
classification, while causal representation learning with DINER improves
out-of-distribution performance in multilingual sentiment analysis, albeit with
varying gains across languages.

*Desta Haileselassie Hagos,Legand L. Burge,Anietie Andy,Anis Yazidi,Vladimir Vlassov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiSparse-AAS combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear attention to overcome Transformer limitations in text summarization, achieving significant ROUGE improvements on major datasets while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer architectures have quadratic complexity that limits scalability on long documents, creating a need for more efficient yet effective summarization methods.

Method: BiSparse-AAS framework integrates three key components: sparse attention to reduce computational costs, adaptive spans that dynamically adjust attention ranges, and bilinear attention to model complex token interactions within the refined context.

Result: The method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average ROUGE improvements of 68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets.

Conclusion: BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution for real-world text summarization by addressing efficiency, scalability, and long-sequence modeling challenges.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have advanced text summarization, yet their
quadratic complexity limits scalability on long documents. This paper
introduces BiSparse-AAS (Bilinear Sparse Attention with Adaptive Spans), a
novel framework that combines sparse attention, adaptive spans, and bilinear
attention to address these limitations. Sparse attention reduces computational
costs by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input, while adaptive spans
dynamically adjust the attention ranges. Bilinear attention complements both by
modeling complex token interactions within this refined context. BiSparse-AAS
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extractive and
abstractive summarization tasks, achieving average ROUGE improvements of about
68.1% on CNN/DailyMail and 52.6% on XSum, while maintaining strong performance
on OpenWebText and Gigaword datasets. By addressing efficiency, scalability,
and long-sequence modeling, BiSparse-AAS provides a unified, practical solution
for real-world text summarization applications.

TL;DR: SQLSpace is a human-interpretable representation for text-to-SQL examples that enables detailed analysis of benchmarks, model performance, and query improvement through targeted rewriting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a compact, generalizable representation for text-to-SQL examples that requires minimal human intervention and enables deeper analysis than raw examples alone.

Method: Developed SQLSpace representations derived from text-to-SQL examples, then applied them to compare benchmark compositions, analyze model performance granularly, and improve models through correctness-based query rewriting.

Result: SQLSpace revealed compositional differences between benchmarks, exposed performance patterns hidden by accuracy scores, and supported successful modeling of query success for targeted improvements.

Conclusion: SQLSpace enables sophisticated analysis of text-to-SQL systems that would be difficult with raw examples, providing valuable insights into benchmark composition, model performance patterns, and opportunities for targeted improvement.

Abstract: We introduce SQLSpace, a human-interpretable, generalizable, compact
representation for text-to-SQL examples derived with minimal human
intervention. We demonstrate the utility of these representations in evaluation
with three use cases: (i) closely comparing and contrasting the composition of
popular text-to-SQL benchmarks to identify unique dimensions of examples they
evaluate, (ii) understanding model performance at a granular level beyond
overall accuracy scores, and (iii) improving model performance through targeted
query rewriting based on learned correctness estimation. We show that SQLSpace
enables analysis that would be difficult with raw examples alone: it reveals
compositional differences between benchmarks, exposes performance patterns
obscured by accuracy alone, and supports modeling of query success.

Branda,Misk Al Zahidy,Saturnino Luz,Mirella Lapata,Juan P. Brito,Oscar J. Ponce-Ponte*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes Patient-Centered Summaries (PCS) as a new standard for AI clinical summarization, focusing on capturing patient values and preferences rather than just biological information. The study evaluates open-source LLMs' ability to generate PCS from patient-clinician conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-generated clinical summaries focus too much on patients' biology while neglecting their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns, which are essential for patient-centered care.

Method: Mixed-methods approach involving patient and clinician interviews to develop annotation guidelines, creation of gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations, and evaluation of five open-source LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot prompting with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics.

Result: Patients emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, stressors, and care values. Mistral-8B performed best in zero-shot (ROUGE-L 0.189) while Llama-3.1-8B performed best in few-shot (ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Human PCS outperformed models in correctness and patient-centeredness.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can generate clinically useful patient-centered summaries with good completeness and fluency, but human-generated summaries remain superior in correctness and patient-centeredness, highlighting the need for further development in this area.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating the potential to
reach human-level performance in generating clinical summaries from
patient-clinician conversations. However, these summaries often focus on
patients' biology rather than their preferences, values, wishes, and concerns.
To achieve patient-centered care, we propose a new standard for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) clinical summarization tasks: Patient-Centered Summaries
(PCS). Our objective was to develop a framework to generate PCS that capture
patient values and ensure clinical utility and to assess whether current
open-source LLMs can achieve human-level performance in this task. We used a
mixed-methods process. Two Patient and Public Involvement groups (10 patients
and 8 clinicians) in the United Kingdom participated in semi-structured
interviews exploring what personal and contextual information should be
included in clinical summaries and how it should be structured for clinical
use. Findings informed annotation guidelines used by eight clinicians to create
gold-standard PCS from 88 atrial fibrillation consultations. Sixteen
consultations were used to refine a prompt aligned with the guidelines. Five
open-source LLMs (Llama-3.2-3B, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-8B, Gemma-3-4B, and
Qwen3-8B) generated summaries for 72 consultations using zero-shot and few-shot
prompting, evaluated with ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and qualitative metrics. Patients
emphasized lifestyle routines, social support, recent stressors, and care
values. Clinicians sought concise functional, psychosocial, and emotional
context. The best zero-shot performance was achieved by Mistral-8B (ROUGE-L
0.189) and Llama-3.1-8B (BERTScore 0.673); the best few-shot by Llama-3.1-8B
(ROUGE-L 0.206, BERTScore 0.683). Completeness and fluency were similar between
experts and models, while correctness and patient-centeredness favored human
PCS.

TL;DR: DialectalArabicMMLU is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs across Arabic dialects, extending MMLU-Redux with 15K QA pairs across 5 major dialects and 32 domains, revealing performance gaps in dialectal generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic, but dialectal varieties remain underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.

Method: Manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs from MMLU-Redux into five major Arabic dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, Moroccan), creating 15K QA pairs across 32 domains.

Result: Evaluation of 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) revealed substantial performance variation across dialects, showing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.

Conclusion: DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, promoting more inclusive evaluation and future model development.

Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the
performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While
recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM
evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain
underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication.
DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation
and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major
dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of
15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when
also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of
LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and
linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs
(1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across
dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization.
DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for
measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain adaptation through further pre-training on medical corpora significantly improves multilingual BERT performance on healthcare NLP tasks for low-resource languages (Dutch, Romanian, Spanish), with clinical domain adaptation outperforming general biomedical adaptation and showing cross-lingual transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited availability of domain-specific NLP tools for low-resource languages in healthcare applications, despite multilingual BERT's potential to bridge language gaps in medical NLP tasks.

Method: Conducted four experiments for domain adaptation through further pre-training on medical corpora, then fine-tuned models on three downstream tasks: automated patient screening (Dutch), named entity recognition (Romanian and Spanish clinical notes).

Result: Domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance, with clinical domain-adapted models outperforming general biomedical domain-adapted models. Evidence of cross-lingual transferability was observed.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation and cross-lingual capabilities are feasible in medical NLP, providing meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems in low-resource language settings to mitigate data scarcity and improve performance.

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific
natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource
languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from
transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap,
the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored.
Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific
corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three
languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we
conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models
were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch
clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical
notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task
performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and
general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical
domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted
model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability.
Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons
contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the
feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP.
Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide
meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate
the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance.

*Inacio Vieira,Antonio Castaldo,James O'Doherty,Sheila Castilho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CPO enables data-efficient domain adaptation by using the base model's raw output as 'rejected' translations and human-approved TM entries as 'chosen' ones, achieving performance comparable to SFT with 10x less data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs require expensive domain adaptation through SFT; CPO offers a more data-efficient alternative by simulating post-editing workflows.

Method: Synthesize preference pairs using base model's raw output as rejected translations and human-approved TM entries as chosen ones, applying CPO for direct feedback on model knowledge.

Result: With only 14.7k preference pairs, CPO achieves performance close to SFT trained on 160k+ samples in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean MT tasks.

Conclusion: CPO provides significant data efficiency for domain adaptation and generalizes to other generative tasks where initial drafts can contrast with golden references.

Abstract: LLMs often require adaptation to domain-specific requirements, a process that
can be expensive when relying solely on SFT. We present an empirical study on
applying CPO to simulate a post-editing workflow for data-efficient domain
adaptation. Our approach synthesizes preference pairs by treating the base
model's own raw output as the 'rejected' translation and the human-approved TM
entry as the 'chosen' one. This method provides direct feedback on the model's
current knowledge, guiding it to align with domain-specific standards.
Experiments in English-Brazilian Portuguese and English-Korean show that, by
using just 14.7k preference pairs, the model achieves performance close to that
of a model trained on 160k+ samples with SFT, demonstrating significant data
efficiency. Although we showcase its effectiveness in MT, this application of
CPO naturally generalizes to other generative tasks where a model's initial
drafts can serve as a contrastive signal against a golden reference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARAG-R1 is a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms for broader and more precise information access, achieving state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems rely on a single retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static subset of the corpus, which has become the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning.

Method: MARAG-R1 equips the model with four retrieval tools (semantic search, keyword search, filtering, and aggregation) and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning, allowing the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval.

Result: Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-tool RAG framework with reinforcement learning enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval mechanisms, overcoming the limitations of single-retriever systems and achieving superior performance in comprehensive information acquisition for corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and generation but are
inherently limited by static pretraining data, resulting in factual
inaccuracies and weak adaptability to new information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by grounding LLMs in external knowledge;
However, the effectiveness of RAG critically depends on whether the model can
adequately access relevant information. Existing RAG systems rely on a single
retriever with fixed top-k selection, restricting access to a narrow and static
subset of the corpus. As a result, this single-retriever paradigm has become
the primary bottleneck for comprehensive external information acquisition,
especially in tasks requiring corpus-level reasoning. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MARAG-R1, a reinforcement-learned multi-tool RAG
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically coordinate multiple retrieval
mechanisms for broader and more precise information access. MARAG-R1 equips the
model with four retrieval tools -- semantic search, keyword search, filtering,
and aggregation -- and learns both how and when to use them through a two-stage
training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning.
This design allows the model to interleave reasoning and retrieval,
progressively gathering sufficient evidence for corpus-level synthesis.
Experiments on GlobalQA, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA demonstrate that
MARAG-R1 substantially outperforms strong baselines and achieves new
state-of-the-art results in corpus-level reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpecAttn is a training-free method that integrates with speculative decoding to enable efficient sparse attention in LLMs by reusing draft model attention weights to identify important tokens, reducing KV cache accesses by over 75% with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face computational bottlenecks during inference due to quadratic complexity of self-attention, especially with long contexts. Existing methods need improvement for efficient inference without retraining.

Method: Uses three techniques: KL divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, GPU-optimized sorting-free top-p token selection from draft attention patterns, and dynamic KV cache pruning guided by these predictions.

Result: Achieves over 75% reduction in KV cache accesses with only 15.29% increase in perplexity on PG-19 dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods.

Conclusion: Speculative execution can be enhanced to provide approximate verification without significant performance degradation, demonstrating effective reuse of computational work in standard speculative decoding pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational bottlenecks
during inference due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms,
particularly as context lengths increase. We introduce SpecAttn, a novel
training-free approach that seamlessly integrates with existing speculative
decoding techniques to enable efficient sparse attention in pre-trained
transformers. Our key insight is to exploit the attention weights already
computed by the draft model during speculative decoding to identify important
tokens for the target model, eliminating redundant computation while
maintaining output quality. SpecAttn employs three core techniques: KL
divergence-based layer alignment between draft and target models, a
GPU-optimized sorting-free algorithm for top-p token selection from draft
attention patterns, and dynamic key-value cache pruning guided by these
predictions. By leveraging the computational work already performed in standard
speculative decoding pipelines, SpecAttn achieves over 75% reduction in
key-value cache accesses with a mere 15.29% increase in perplexity on the PG-19
dataset, significantly outperforming existing sparse attention methods. Our
approach demonstrates that speculative execution can be enhanced to provide
approximate verification without significant performance degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CultureCartography is a mixed-initiative methodology where LLMs identify knowledge gaps through low-confidence questions, allowing humans to fill cultural knowledge that leading models lack, improving model performance by up to 19.2% on culture benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need culture-specific knowledge that may not be learned during pre-training to serve global users safely and productively. Current approaches are single-initiative, lacking collaboration between users and researchers.

Method: Proposed CultureCartography methodology: LLM initializes annotation with low-confidence questions, making knowledge gaps explicit. Human respondents fill gaps and steer towards salient topics through direct edits. Implemented as CultureExplorer tool.

Result: CultureExplorer more effectively produces knowledge that leading models (DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o) are missing, even with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts Llama-3.1-8B accuracy by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

Conclusion: Mixed-initiative collaboration between LLMs and humans effectively identifies and fills cultural knowledge gaps, significantly improving model performance on culture-specific tasks.

Abstract: To serve global users safely and productively, LLMs need culture-specific
knowledge that might not be learned during pre-training. How do we find such
knowledge that is (1) salient to in-group users, but (2) unknown to LLMs? The
most common solutions are single-initiative: either researchers define
challenging questions that users passively answer (traditional annotation), or
users actively produce data that researchers structure as benchmarks (knowledge
extraction). The process would benefit from mixed-initiative collaboration,
where users guide the process to meaningfully reflect their cultures, and LLMs
steer the process towards more challenging questions that meet the researcher's
goals. We propose a mixed-initiative methodology called CultureCartography.
Here, an LLM initializes annotation with questions for which it has
low-confidence answers, making explicit both its prior knowledge and the gaps
therein. This allows a human respondent to fill these gaps and steer the model
towards salient topics through direct edits. We implement this methodology as a
tool called CultureExplorer. Compared to a baseline where humans answer
LLM-proposed questions, we find that CultureExplorer more effectively produces
knowledge that leading models like DeepSeek R1 and GPT-4o are missing, even
with web search. Fine-tuning on this data boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B
by up to 19.2% on related culture benchmarks.

### [122] [Continuous Autoregressive Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688)
*Chenze Shao,Darren Li,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CALM introduces continuous next-vector prediction to replace token-by-token generation, compressing K tokens into single vectors to reduce generative steps by factor K and improve computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the fundamental efficiency bottleneck of sequential token-by-token generation in large language models by increasing semantic bandwidth per generative step.

Method: Uses high-fidelity autoencoder to compress chunks of K tokens into continuous vectors with >99.9% reconstruction accuracy, enabling language modeling as sequences of continuous vectors rather than discrete tokens.

Result: Significantly improves performance-compute trade-off, achieving performance of strong discrete baselines at significantly lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Establishes next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway toward ultra-efficient language models.

Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by
their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming
this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the
semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce
Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from
discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses
a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single
continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with
over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of
continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of
generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new
modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free
framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling
in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the
performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete
baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these
findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway
towards ultra-efficient language models. Code:

### [123] [CATArena: Evaluation of LLM Agents through Iterative Tournament Competitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852)
*Lingyue Fu,Xin Ding,Yaoming Zhu,Shao Zhang,Lin Qiu,Weiwen Liu,Weinan Zhang,Xuezhi Cao,Xunliang Cai,Jiaxin Ding,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CATArena is a tournament-style evaluation platform that addresses score saturation in LLM agent benchmarks by using board/card games with open-ended scoring to continuously assess learning ability and strategy coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent benchmarks suffer from score saturation and limited evaluation scope, failing to properly assess learning ability which is crucial for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence.

Method: Proposes an iterative competitive peer-learning framework where agents refine strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, evaluated through CATArena platform with four diverse board/card games featuring open-ended scoring.

Result: Experimental results show CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding, with both minimal and commercial code agents.

Conclusion: CATArena enables continuous dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities by addressing score saturation issues and focusing on learning ability as a core driver for agent evolution.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to
autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools.
However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed
scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score
saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities
improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability,
including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent
evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive
peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their
strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically
evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue
in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation
platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring.
By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables
continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities.
Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code
agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable
benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and
strategy coding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that decompresses scientific reasoning by creating verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge bases and projecting them into SciencePedia, enabling trustworthy cross-domain scientific synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific materials often compress reasoning by presenting conclusions while omitting derivational chains, which hinders verification and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing logical and causal connections between concepts.

Method: Uses an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy with a Socratic agent guided by 200 courses to generate 3 million first-principles questions. Multiple solver models generate LCoTs, filtered through prompt sanitization and cross-model consensus. The Brainstorm Search Engine retrieves derivations, and Plato synthesizer narrates chains into articles.

Result: Created SciencePedia with 200,000 entries across six disciplines. Plato-synthesized articles show higher knowledge-point density and lower factual error rates than baseline without retrieval. Evaluations across mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation demonstrate effectiveness.

Conclusion: The reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia built on verifiable LCoT knowledge base.

Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while
omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders
verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits
cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical
and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that
decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long
Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent
encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven,
reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200
courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To
ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which
are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer
consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus
powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search --
retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target
concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates
these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia
comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations
across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved
LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly
lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval
(as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base,
this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific
synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding
encyclopedia.

TL;DR: Introduces Cognition Envelopes as reasoning boundaries for AI models in cyber-physical systems to address errors like hallucinations and overgeneralizations, complementing traditional safety measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundational Models in cyber-physical systems introduce new error types (hallucinations, overgeneralizations, context misalignments) that lead to incorrect decisions, requiring new safety mechanisms.

Method: Proposes Cognition Envelopes as reasoning boundaries to constrain AI-generated decisions, working alongside meta-cognition and traditional safety envelopes with systematic definition, validation, and assurance processes.

Result: Conceptual framework established for Cognition Envelopes that can constrain AI decision-making errors while complementing existing safety measures in cyber-physical systems.

Conclusion: Cognition Envelopes provide a systematic approach to address novel AI error types in cyber-physical systems, requiring practical guidelines and validation processes similar to traditional safety envelopes.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy
through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models
also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations,
overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and
flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition
Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain
AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and
traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes
require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition,
validation, and assurance.

### [128] [Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009)
*Jared Junkin,Samuel Nathanson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Language models with causal masking on spatial chess board data outperform those trained on sequential move data, challenging the traditional preference for sequential representations in nonsequential domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether causal masking is viable for nonsequential spatial data, using chess as a test domain that naturally supports both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) representations.

Method: Trained language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial board states and sequential move data in chess.

Result: Models trained on spatial board states with causal masking consistently achieved stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data.

Conclusion: Applying causal masking to spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, and in some domains may be preferable to sequentialization.

Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains
with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as
inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question
of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal
masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because
few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same
dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which
naturally supports both representations. We train language models with
bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial
(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models
trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} -
consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on
sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are
methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to
spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,
and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.

### [129] [e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27042)
*Michael Kleinman,Matthew Trager,Alessandro Achille,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Effort Control is a reinforcement learning method that allows users to control AI reasoning effort through a continuous parameter, enabling 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users need fine-grained control over AI reasoning effort to balance output quality versus latency and cost, but existing methods require knowing problem difficulty beforehand to set token budgets.

Method: Self-adaptive reinforcement learning that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query.

Result: The approach produces better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves, enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance across model scales from 1.5B to 32B parameters.

Conclusion: Adaptive Effort Control eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while allowing dynamic adjustment of cost-accuracy trade-offs through a continuous effort parameter at inference time.

Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve
accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may
prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they
value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff
effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used
for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing
methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but
this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately
set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive
Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains
models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current
average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates
dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy
tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the
cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at
inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate
resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales
ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x
reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance
relative to the base model used for RL training.

TL;DR: NVIDIA implemented a MAPE-driven data flywheel in their NVInfo AI enterprise assistant, using human feedback to identify and fix RAG pipeline failures through targeted fine-tuning, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and latency while reducing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise AI agents need continuous adaptation to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and stay aligned with user needs in production environments.

Method: Implemented a MAPE-driven data flywheel with closed-loop system using NVIDIA NeMo microservices for fine-tuning. Collected 495 negative samples over 3 months, identified routing and query rephrasal errors, and performed targeted model improvements.

Result: For routing: replaced Llama 3.1 70B with fine-tuned 8B model achieving 96% accuracy, 10x model size reduction, and 70% latency improvement. For query rephrasal: 3.7% accuracy gain and 40% latency reduction.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop feedback structured within a data flywheel enables enterprise AI agents to become self-improving systems, providing a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive AI agents that learn from real-world usage at scale.

Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce
latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical
implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a
MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically
addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we
monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two
major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors
(3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements
through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a
fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size,
and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\%
gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how
human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel,
transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings
include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback,
navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production.
This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive
enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.

TL;DR: The paper assesses LLMs' ability to grade mathematical proofs beyond binary correctness, introduces agentic workflows for multi-step grading with problem-specific rubrics, and shows improved agreement with human grades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With SOTA LLMs now solving most IMO 2025 problems, the research aims to evaluate their capability in proof grading - detecting errors, judging severity, and assigning fair partial credit scores rather than just binary correctness.

Method: The study uses a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions graded on 1-4 scale with error annotations, and MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on 0-7 scale. It introduces agentic workflows that extract reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for multi-step grading.

Result: Models can reliably flag incorrect solutions (including subtle errors) but exhibit calibration gaps in partial credit assignment. The proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics.

Conclusion: Agentic workflows with problem-specific rubrics significantly improve LLMs' proof grading capabilities, addressing calibration gaps in partial credit assignment and achieving better alignment with human evaluation standards.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Motivation: To explore whether AI can autonomously design computer system mechanisms with creativity and reasoning comparable to human experts, moving beyond black-box optimization approaches.

Method: Uses large language models in a human-inspired multi-agent workflow where specialized agents handle reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback.

Conclusion: By combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems, generating interpretable designs and exposing reasoning processes unlike prior black-box methods.

Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the
creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture
for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a
human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning,
experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework
that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior
ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates
interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a
distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for
request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert
levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload
behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a practical framework for System of Systems (SoS) lifecycle management that integrates MBSE, PLM, CAD-CAE, digital thread and digital twin to address challenges in networked product development across organizational boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear life cycle models are inadequate for modern networked systems where interoperability, variant management, traceability, and cross-organizational governance are critical factors.

Method: The paper proposes a reference framework combining MBSE as semantic backbone, PLM for governance, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread/twin for continuous feedback. It identifies four principles and a three-step roadmap for transitioning from product-centric to network-centric development.

Result: The approach enables increased change robustness, shorter throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions through measurable value contributions across time, quality, cost, and sustainability.

Conclusion: The framework helps decision-makers and practitioners manage complexity and design scalable SoS value streams by providing a structured approach to networked system development with clear governance and measurable outcomes.

Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked
systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are
reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and
configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational
boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies
the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS
lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic
backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and
configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and
digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry
experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four
principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end
configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear
review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost,
and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to
network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling
across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles,
training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter
throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This
article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make
complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel fine-grained and instance-tailored steering framework for LLM personalization that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them during forward passes, addressing limitations of existing methods in handling dynamic user patterns and data sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM personalization methods (parametric adaptation, personalized fine-tuning, reward modeling) struggle with dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity due to low adaptability and data efficiency, creating a need for more flexible and efficient approaches.

Method: Proposes a framework with two key innovations: 1) fine-grained steering component that hooks activations from attention and MLP layers to capture nuanced signals, and 2) input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements. The method operates as a plug-in component compatible with existing personalization techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios (short-to-long text generation, web function calling) show the method significantly enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates high flexibility, data efficiency, and compatibility with existing methods, effectively addressing challenges in dynamic user patterns and data sparsity scenarios for LLM personalization.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior
to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing
the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods,
including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling
emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user
patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and
instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level
interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward
pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical
innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by
hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware
aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant
enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency,
excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In
addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as
a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques.
Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text
generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and
compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly
enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while
maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-Rise is a reasoning-enhanced framework for GUI navigation agents that combines structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization to improve cross-domain generalization and history utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI navigation face limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization, requiring a more systematic approach to reasoning and memory management.

Method: The framework integrates structured reasoning with Chain-of-Thought analyses, action prediction, and compact history summarization. GUI-Rise is trained through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using specialized rewards including a history-aware objective.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong results in out-of-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework successfully maintains robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks, validating the effectiveness of the integrated reasoning and history management approach.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation
agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and
effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that
systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history
summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent
Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning,
which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries
for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent,
\textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled

### [136] [Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Unordered Tasks: From Boolean to Coupled Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27329)
*Kristina Levina,Nikolaos Pappas,Athanasios Karapantelakis,Aneta Vulgarakis Feljan,Jendrik Seipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations of reward machines (RMs) in handling long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks by introducing three generalizations: Numeric RMs, Agenda RMs, and Coupled RMs, along with a new compositional learning algorithm called CoRM that shows better scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward machines help reinforcement learning agents learn more efficiently from complex non-Markovian tasks, but they struggle with long-horizon problems where subtasks can be completed in any order, leading to exponential information growth with unordered subtasks.

Method: The authors propose three generalizations: Numeric RMs for compact task expression, Agenda RMs that track remaining subtasks, and Coupled RMs with states associated with each subtask. They also introduce CoRM (Q-learning with coupled RMs), a compositional learning algorithm.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Conclusion: The proposed generalizations of reward machines and the CoRM algorithm effectively address the scalability limitations of traditional RMs in handling complex long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward
structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex
non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more
efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for
long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order.
In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with
the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by
introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to
express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are
associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)
Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.
Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages
coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM
scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems
with unordered subtasks.

### [137] [Discriminative Rule Learning for Outcome-Guided Process Model Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27343)
*Ali Norouzifar,Wil van der Aalst*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an outcome-aware process discovery approach that separates desirable and undesirable process executions to create interpretable discriminative models, revealing key behavioral differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional process discovery creates single models that fail to capture critical differences between desirable and undesirable executions, limiting effectiveness for conformance checking and performance analysis.

Method: Learn interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features to group traces by desirability, then apply process discovery separately within each group to create focused models.

Result: Implemented as a publicly available tool and evaluated on multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating effectiveness in isolating and visualizing critical process patterns.

Conclusion: The outcome-aware approach produces interpretable models that reveal drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions, providing better insights for process improvement.

Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for
understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world
applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable
process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant
behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,
delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide
process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process
model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for
conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical
behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may
obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By
learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we
group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery
separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models
that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The
approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on
multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and
visualizing critical process patterns.

### [138] [An In-depth Study of LLM Contributions to the Bin Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27353)
*Julien Herrmann,Guillaume Pallez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reassesses claims about LLMs contributing to mathematical discovery by analyzing LLM-generated heuristics for online bin packing, finding them opaque and proposing simpler, more interpretable alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically evaluate recent claims that LLMs can provide meaningful contributions to mathematical discovery, specifically examining LLM-generated heuristics for online bin packing problems.

Method: Conducted detailed analysis of LLM-generated heuristics, examined their behavior and interpretability, and proposed new simpler algorithms tailored to specific bin packing instances.

Result: Found LLM-generated heuristics to be largely opaque even to domain experts, and developed significantly simpler, more efficient, interpretable, and generalizable algorithms that outperform the LLM-generated ones.

Conclusion: The claims about LLMs' mathematical contributions appear overstated and rest on mistaken assumptions about prior study of the problem instances, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation of LLM-generated scientific outputs.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide
interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was
motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics
offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and
Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed
analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and
interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely
opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new
class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The
derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more
interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances
are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim
regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the
mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our
findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and
contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.

*Mengjie Deng,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolScope is an agentic framework that unifies global planning with local multimodal perception to enhance MLLMs' ability to use external tools for complex VQA tasks, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with flexibly and efficiently utilizing external tools during reasoning due to the complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, especially in long-horizon VQA tasks where visual context degradation is a major challenge.

Method: ToolScope consists of three components: Global Navigator for high-level strategic guidance, Agentic Executor for iterative local perception through external tools (Search, Code, Perceive), and Response Synthesizer for organizing reasoning into coherent outputs.

Result: ToolScope achieves an average performance improvement of +6.69% across four VQA benchmarks (VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search, MathVista), demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively addresses the challenge of flexible tool utilization in MLLMs by combining global planning with local multimodal perception, significantly improving performance on diverse VQA tasks while mitigating visual context degradation.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools
for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse
nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning
remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an
agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal
perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context
degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary
components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response
Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering
high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to
augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external
tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer
consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly
output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains,
including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up
to +6.69% across all datasets.

### [140] [Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383)
*Yueyang Wang,Mehmet Dogar,Gustav Markkula*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates visual and motor constraints for modeling pedestrian-driver interactions, outperforming existing approaches in realism without requiring large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pedestrian-driver interaction models lack flexibility or overlook sensory and motor constraints that shape human perception and action in interactive scenarios.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with four variants: no constraints, motor constraints only, visual constraints only, and combined constraints. Uses real-world dataset from unsignalised pedestrian crossing.

Result: The combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints produce smoother human-like movements, while visual constraints introduce perceptual uncertainty leading to more cautious behavior. Outperforms supervised behavioral cloning in data-limited settings.

Conclusion: Multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising approach for simulating realistic road user interactions, accounting for individual differences through population-level parameter distributions.

Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human
road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing
approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or
'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack
flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor
constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in
interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of
pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised
pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,
two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across
behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined
model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints
lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during
crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual
uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more
cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this
data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning
model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training
datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by
modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level
distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on
pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that
multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for
simulating realistic road user interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nous is an AI agent that addresses the intention expression gap in human-AI collaboration by actively probing users to resolve uncertainty about their intent, using information gain as an intrinsic reward signal based on Shannon entropy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration where users struggle to effectively convey complex thoughts to AI, leading to inefficient trial-and-error loops, especially given diverse user expertise levels.

Method: Proposes a Socratic collaboration paradigm with agent Nous trained using information theory principles, defining information gain from dialogue as intrinsic reward equivalent to Shannon entropy reduction over structured task space, avoiding need for human preference annotations.

Result: Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality in scientific diagram generation tasks, remains robust to varying user expertise, shows domain-agnostic design with evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration through information-theoretic training framework.

Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention
expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex,
high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in
inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise
levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to
a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for
information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed
agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core
mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of
information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from
dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to
the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward
design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or
external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated
simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the
challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments,
including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across
user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to
varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show
evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results
prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for
resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.

### [142] [DeepCompress: A Dual Reward Strategy for Dynamically Exploring and Compressing Reasoning Chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27419)
*Tian Liang,Wenxiang Jiao,Zhiwei He,Jiahao Xu,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepCompress is a framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency of Large Reasoning Models by adaptively adjusting reasoning length based on problem difficulty, using shorter paths for simple problems and longer exploration for hard ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for improving reasoning efficiency often sacrifice accuracy, and the common approach of favoring shorter reasoning paths overlooks that longer responses can contain more correct solutions for difficult problems.

Method: Uses adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as Simple or Hard in real-time, with dual-reward strategy: shorter reasoning for simple problems, longer exploratory chains for hard problems.

Result: Outperforms baseline methods on challenging mathematical benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Conclusion: DeepCompress enables models to autonomously adjust Chain-of-Thought length, compressing reasoning for mastered problems and extending it for challenging ones, achieving both accuracy and efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but
suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and
``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised
fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can
improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper
introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously
enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing
approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer
responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult
problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that
dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on
the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient
reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory
thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the
model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing
reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds
challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show
that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoFM is a novel method for synthesizing geometric data using formal languages and symbolic engines to generate diverse, high-fidelity geometric problems, significantly improving MLLMs' performance on geometry reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to scarcity of high-quality geometric data, and existing synthetic data generation methods produce limited, noisy data that lacks diversity and authenticity.

Method: GeoFM uses formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space and generates high-fidelity geometric problems through a symbolic engine, ensuring correctness while creating variations from original problems.

Result: Models trained with GeoFM synthetic data outperform GPT-4o by 18.7% on MathVista and 16.5% on GeoQA, and exceed leading open-source models by 5.7% on MathVista and 2.7% on GeoQA.

Conclusion: GeoFM effectively addresses the geometric data scarcity problem by generating diverse, high-quality synthetic data that significantly enhances MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal
tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric
reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this
issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current
methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding
existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create
geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data
that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images
synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate
significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,
we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses
formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,
generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals
while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show
that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model
trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on
geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA.
Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by
5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.

*Nikolaus Holzer,William Fishell,Baishakhi Ray,Mark Santolucito*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TempoBench is a formally verifiable diagnostic benchmark that evaluates LLM reasoning through temporal trace evaluation (TTE) and temporal causal evaluation (TCE), revealing that while LLMs understand causal reasoning tasks, their performance significantly drops as system complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning evaluation methods have limitations - ad-hoc datasets may contain bias and lack formal verification, while formal proof systems like Lean don't capture real-world agentic decision chains, creating gaps in both performance and benchmark usefulness.

Method: TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks: TTE tests LLM's ability to understand and simulate multi-step reasoning system execution, and TCE tests multi-step causal reasoning and cause-and-effect relation distillation from complex systems.

Result: Models scored 65.6% on TCE-normal and only 7.5% on TCE-hard, showing that while state-of-the-art LLMs understand the TCE task, their performance dramatically decreases as system complexity increases.

Conclusion: TempoBench provides the first formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic benchmark for systematically analyzing LLM reasoning, revealing significant performance gaps in complex reasoning tasks that need to be addressed for improved LLM capabilities in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human
performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers
either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems
such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture
the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some
inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be
formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee
verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic
decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for
functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of
LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or
real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and
verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically
analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks
to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests
the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given
multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE)
tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill
cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score
65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art
LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity
increases. Our code is available at our

Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented models have limitations in mathematical reasoning: they rely on single perspectives, use inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information from multiple sources.

Method: SIGMA uses a unified framework with specialized agents that independently reason, perform targeted searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its specific analytic perspective.

Result: SIGMA consistently outperforms both open- and closed-source systems on challenging benchmarks (MATH500, AIME, GPQA), achieving an absolute performance improvement of 7.4%.

Conclusion: Multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving.

Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to
relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current
retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow
inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information
from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge
Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that
orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted
searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent
generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic
perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and
computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as
MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms
both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance
improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand

Motivation: Existing benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings, failing to capture the full complexity of scientific discovery processes that AI agents could automate, including hypothesis formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis.

Method: Developed InnovatorBench with 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, along with ResearchGym environment providing rich action spaces, distributed execution, and monitoring capabilities. Implemented a ReAct agent using frontier models like Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K5.

Result: Frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks but struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, exhibiting impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Agents require over 11 hours to achieve best performance, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.

Conclusion: InnovatorBench demonstrates potential as the next generation of code-based research benchmark, revealing both the capabilities and limitations of current AI agents in realistic scientific research scenarios, particularly in complex, long-horizon tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and planning.

Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis

introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end
assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It
comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss
Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable
artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and
uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research
environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon
execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a
lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable
planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2.
Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in
code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks
and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management,
and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over
11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the
benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriMoA is a training-free mixture-of-agents framework that improves HDL generation through quality-guided caching and multi-path generation using C++/Python as intermediate representations, achieving 15-30% Pass@1 improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise for HDL generation but face challenges with limited parametric knowledge and domain constraints. Current multi-agent approaches suffer from noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration.

Method: Proposes VeriMoA with two innovations: 1) quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all intermediate HDL outputs with quality-based ranking, and 2) multi-path generation strategy using C++ and Python as intermediate representations to decompose specification-to-HDL translation.

Result: Achieves 15-30% improvements in Pass@1 across VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks, enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without training.

Conclusion: VeriMoA provides an effective training-free paradigm for HDL generation that enhances reasoning through collaborative generation while overcoming limitations of current multi-agent approaches.

Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet
increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for
Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to
limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt
engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training
costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance
reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent
approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise
propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a
training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic
innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all
intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across
the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers
of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and
Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL
translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource
languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on
VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves
15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially
enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives
without requiring costly training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BEAT is the first framework for injecting visual backdoor attacks into MLLM-based embodied agents using environmental objects as triggers, achieving up to 80% attack success while maintaining normal task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose security vulnerabilities in MLLM-based embodied agents where visual triggers can persistently manipulate agent behavior, creating a critical security risk that needs addressing before real-world deployment.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning followed by Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL) that treats trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs to sharpen decision boundaries.

Result: Achieves up to 80% attack success rates across various benchmarks while maintaining strong benign task performance, with CTL boosting backdoor activation accuracy by up to 39% compared to naive SFT.

Conclusion: Visual backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat to MLLM-based embodied agents, highlighting the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms before real-world implementation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by
enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from
visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack
surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a
visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an
attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to
inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in
the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit
wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant
reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that
spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger
variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning
(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between
trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision
boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent
benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while
maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to
out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL
boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.
These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based
embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world
deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear definition of Agentic AI and highlight that while LLMs have driven excitement, the success of Agentic AI systems depends primarily on validation by stakeholders rather than the sophistication of foundation models.

Method: The authors analyze existing definitions of Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition, comparing it to software as a service (SaaS). They discuss the role of LLMs as foundation models but emphasize that Agentic AI systems are applications requiring user validation.

Result: The paper establishes that validation tools for Agentic AI applications differ from those used for foundation model evaluation, and that simpler, faster models can often replace LLMs when proper validation measures are in place.

Conclusion: Validity is the key requirement for Agentic AI systems, and LLMs are just one possible option to achieve it - simpler models may be preferable when they can meet validation requirements.

Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science,
today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of
Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software
delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an
application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven
excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are
primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on
validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques
needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite
different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models.
Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the
foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more
interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI,
validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.

TL;DR: Apollo is a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering to train LLM agents on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks more efficiently than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for training LLM agents on long-horizon tasks are either too expensive (behavior cloning with dense human annotations) or ineffective (outcome-driven sampling that collapses due to rare positive trajectories).

Method: Apollo allows human annotators to intervene only when agents drift from promising trajectories, providing prior knowledge and strategic advice. It applies supervision control to filter sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation.

Result: When applied to train GLM-4.5 on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieved over 50% improvement over untrained baseline and 28% improvement over variant trained without human interaction.

Conclusion: Apollo demonstrates the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and provides a robust framework for handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in
domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface
manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall
into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through
behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that
can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which
often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on
domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that
integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.
Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to
intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing
prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it
possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable
trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter
out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these
components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon
environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using
InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5
model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the
untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human
interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop
sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon,
domain-specialized tasks.
