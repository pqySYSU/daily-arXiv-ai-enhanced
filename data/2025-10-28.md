### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU is a diagnostic suite that reveals VLMs struggle with data visualization understanding primarily due to vision-language handoff issues, not visual encoding limitations, and current architectures face fundamental constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs perform poorly on data visualization tasks but the root causes are unclear - whether failures stem from visual encoding, vision-language transfer, or language processing limitations.

Method: Developed FUGU diagnostic tasks to test specific visualization skills, used activation patching and linear probes to trace information flow, and tested three VLMs across various prompting strategies.

Result: VLMs fail to generate correct data point coordinates, but correct coordinates exist in vision encoder representations. Providing correct coordinates improves single-point tasks but worsens statistical analysis tasks. Fine-tuning doesn't achieve ceiling performance.

Conclusion: Vision-language handoff is the primary bottleneck, and current VLM architectures have fundamental constraints that limit reliable data visualization understanding.

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cost-effective self-consistency framework improves vision-language model reliability for agricultural disease diagnosis by using semantic clustering and human-in-the-loop crop type confirmation to select the most coherent captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural disease management in developing countries faces challenges including limited expert access, unreliable internet, and cost constraints that hinder large-scale AI deployment.

Method: Uses semantic clustering with a lightweight embedding model to group candidate responses, then selects the most coherent caption through cosine similarity-based consensus. Incorporates human-in-the-loop crop type confirmation to filter erroneous generations.

Result: Achieved 83.1% accuracy with 10 candidate generations vs 77.5% baseline, and 94.0% accuracy when correct response is in top four clusters vs 88.5% baseline top-4 selection.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves VLM reliability for agricultural image captioning, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements over standard decoding methods while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two specialized ControlNets for artistic control in text-to-image generation: a proportion ControlNet using bounding boxes for object positioning and scaling, and a perspective ControlNet using vanishing lines for 3D scene geometry control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images but offer limited control over spatial and geometric structure, which is crucial for artistic applications.

Method: Developed two ControlNet modules: proportion ControlNet using bounding boxes for object position/scale control, and perspective ControlNet using vanishing lines for 3D geometry control. Supported training with data pipelines using vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for conditioning image synthesis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate both modules provide effective control over spatial and geometric structure, though they exhibit limitations when dealing with complex constraints.

Conclusion: The two specialized ControlNets successfully address the limitation of spatial and geometric control in text-to-image diffusion models, providing artists with enhanced control capabilities, and both models are publicly released on HuggingFace.

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to derive a closed-form lower bound on camera pose estimation covariance by treating differentiable renderers as measurement functions, extending classical bundle adjustment uncertainty to learned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation is crucial for computer vision and robotics, but existing methods lack rigorous uncertainty quantification for dense or learned models, limiting their reliability in applications.

Method: The approach linearizes image formation with respect to small pose perturbations on the manifold, treating differentiable renderers as measurement functions to derive a render-aware Cramér-Rao bound.

Result: The method provides a closed-form lower bound on pose covariance that reduces to classical bundle-adjustment uncertainty and naturally extends to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras.

Conclusion: This statistical formulation enables rigorous uncertainty quantification for pose estimation without requiring explicit keypoint correspondences, with applications in cooperative perception and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [5] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow is a novel framework that learns comprehensive 3D human-object interaction affordances (contact, orientation, spatial occupancy) using only synthetic data from 3D generative models, eliminating the need for labor-intensive human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for 3D affordance understanding rely on costly hand-labeled datasets and are limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting important aspects like orientation preferences and spatial occupancy patterns in human-object interactions.

Method: H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation learned through a dense diffusion process on point clouds, using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative models to discover rich 3D affordances.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and outperforms prior methods that depend on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in modeling 3D affordance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of current approaches by providing comprehensive 3D affordance understanding without human annotations, demonstrating superior performance through synthetic data learning and flow-based representation.

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

*Jianhao Yuan,Xiaofeng Zhang,Felix Friedrich,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Melissa Hall,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Xiaochuang Han,Nicolas Ballas,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The winning entry of PhysicsIQ Challenge improves physics plausibility in video generation by 6% using VJEPA-2 SSL model to guide MAGI-1 video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models lack physical understanding despite visual realism, and SSL pretraining on natural videos has shown emergent physics understanding that could enhance generation plausibility.

Method: Couple state-of-the-art video generative model MAGI-1 with Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process using VJEPA-2 as reward signal.

Result: Improved physics plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by approximately 6% through the proposed approach.

Conclusion: SSL-based video world models can effectively enhance the physics plausibility of video generative models when used as guidance mechanisms.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

### [8] [LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21864)
*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation is a novel speech-driven 3D facial animation framework that eliminates explicit emotion/identity encodings, using implicit extraction from speech and neutral facial meshes for better generalization to unseen speakers and emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on explicit one-hot encodings for identity and emotion, limiting generalization to unseen speakers and neglecting emotional cues in speech, which reduces animation naturalness and adaptability.

Method: Implicitly extracts emotion from speech and identity from neutral facial meshes without manual labels. Introduces Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB) using fusion tokens to integrate emotional, motion, and identity cues from dual transformer features.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3DMEAD dataset show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in emotional expressiveness, identity generalization, and animation realism.

Conclusion: LSF-Animation provides a more generalized and natural approach to speech-driven 3D facial animation by eliminating explicit feature dependencies and better leveraging inherent speech cues.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2 is a facial image generation model that addresses facial attribute leakage and physical consistency issues by using a large-scale dataset with spatial supervision, dual facial information injection channels, and optimization objectives for semantic alignment and ID preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models suffer from facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding to local semantic instructions in facial image generation.

Method: 1) Constructed FaceCaptionMask-1M dataset with 1M image-text-masks pairs for spatial supervision; 2) Used pretrained text-to-image model as backbone with 3D facial rendering channel and global facial feature channel; 3) Implemented semantic alignment and perceptual loss optimization objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show Face-MakeUpV2 achieves best overall performance in preserving face ID and maintaining physical consistency of reference images.

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2 demonstrates practical potential for reliable and controllable facial editing in diverse applications.

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [10] [MOGRAS: Human Motion with Grasping in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22199)
*Kunal Bhosikar,Siddharth Katageri,Vivek Madhavaram,Kai Han,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOGRAS introduces a large-scale dataset for generating realistic full-body grasping motions within 3D scenes, addressing limitations in existing methods that either lack fine-grained grasping fidelity or ignore scene context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for full-body motion generation either lack fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping or ignore the surrounding 3D scene context, creating a gap for physically plausible grasping motions in 3D environments.

Method: The authors introduce MOGRAS dataset with pre-grasping walking motions and final grasping poses in annotated 3D indoor scenes, then adapt existing approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes.

Result: The dataset enables benchmarking of existing methods and demonstrates their limitations. The proposed adaptation method shows significant improvements in generating scene-aware grasping motions through quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: MOGRAS dataset and the proposed method pave the way for more realistic human-scene interactions by successfully addressing the challenge of generating physically plausible full-body grasping motions within 3D scenes.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

### [11] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper quantifies face template ageing drift in compact binary codes, finding systematic increases in Hamming distance over time (1.357 bits/decade for 64-bit and 2.571 bits/decade for 128-bit codes), with implications for biometric system stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and measure ageing drift directly in bits per decade, which is crucial for practical biometric deployments like smart-cards and match-on-card systems.

Method: Float embeddings from a modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, genuine pairs are formed and per-identity linear models of Hamming distance versus absolute age gap are fitted.

Result: Across 566 identities, median slopes are 1.357 bits per decade for 64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. Distributions are predominantly positive, indicating systematic increase in intra-class distance over time. Shorter codes are inherently more age-stable at fixed decision thresholds.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates measurable ageing drift in compact binary face templates, with drift scaling with code length. Provides implications for biometric deployments including mitigations like periodic re-enrolment and targeted parity on unstable bit positions. Code and CSV artifacts are provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [12] [VoMP: Predicting Volumetric Mechanical Property Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22975)
*Rishit Dagli,Donglai Xiang,Vismay Modi,Charles Loop,Clement Fuji Tsang,Anka He Chen,Anita Hu,Gavriel State,David I. W. Levin,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP is a feed-forward method that predicts spatially-varying mechanical properties (Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, density) for 3D objects using multi-view features and a Geometry Transformer, trained on real-world data to ensure physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical simulation traditionally requires laborious hand-crafting of spatially-varying mechanical properties, which VoMP aims to automate.

Method: VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features from rendered 3D objects, processes them through a trained Geometry Transformer to predict material latent codes, and ensures physical plausibility through a learned manifold from real-world data.

Result: VoMP significantly outperforms prior methods in both accuracy and speed for estimating volumetric mechanical properties.

Conclusion: The method provides an efficient and accurate approach to automatically predict physically plausible mechanical properties for 3D objects across various representations.

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

### [13] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An interpretable deep learning framework for early breast cancer detection using FNA images achieves state-of-the-art performance (99.2% accuracy) and incorporates SHAP/LIME explanations to enhance clinical trust by identifying concave points as the most influential feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an interpretable deep learning system for breast cancer detection that addresses the black-box problem of traditional deep learning models, enabling clinical adoption by providing transparent explanations alongside high accuracy.

Method: Deep neural network with ReLU activations, Adam optimizer, and binary cross-entropy loss trained on quantitative features from digitized FNA images, enhanced with model-agnostic Explainable AI techniques (SHAP and LIME) for feature attribution and visualization.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: 0.992 accuracy, 1.000 precision, 0.977 recall, and 0.988 F1 score, significantly outperforming traditional algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.) under identical protocols.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges performance and interpretability for clinical use, with concave points of cell nuclei identified as the most influential feature, providing valuable insights for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [14] [Yesnt: Are Diffusion Relighting Models Ready for Capture Stage Compositing? A Hybrid Alternative to Bridge the Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23494)
*Elisabeth Jüttner,Leona Krath,Stefan Korfhage,Hannah Dröge,Matthias B. Hullin,Markus Plack*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid relighting framework combining diffusion material priors with temporal regularization and physical rendering for stable volumetric video relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current volumetric video relighting approaches lack temporal stability for production use, with diffusion methods suffering from noise in sequences and video diffusion models being memory-constrained.

Method: Combines diffusion-derived material priors with optical-flow-guided temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering using mesh proxies from Gaussian Opacity Fields.

Result: Achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines and scales beyond feasible clip lengths for video diffusion.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches balancing learned priors with physically grounded constraints are practical for production-ready volumetric video relighting.

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically

*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync is an efficient edge-model updating approach that improves real-time video analytics by enhancing sample filtering with timeliness and inference results, and optimizing model update timing to address challenges in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time video analytics systems face accuracy degradation due to changing data distributions over time (e.g., lighting, weather conditions). Existing cloud-assisted retraining approaches suffer from compute-intensive delays and poor alignment with evolving video stream distributions.

Method: EdgeSync incorporates enhanced sample filtering using timeliness and inference results to ensure training relevance to current video content, and features a dynamic training management module that optimizes model update timing and sequencing.

Result: Evaluations on diverse real-world datasets show EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: EdgeSync effectively addresses the challenges of delayed model updates and poor distribution alignment in real-time video analytics, providing significant accuracy improvements through efficient sample filtering and dynamic update management.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

*Shuhong Zheng,Ashkan Mirzaei,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE is a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation that improves semantic identity preservation by tracking regions to modify, using subject-driven inpainting, and resplatting modified views back to 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D/4D generation methods often fail to preserve semantic identity across different viewpoints, and personalized 3D/4D generation remains underexplored despite the importance of subject-driven content creation.

Method: TIRE takes an initial 3D asset, uses video tracking to identify regions needing modification, applies subject-driven 2D inpainting to progressively fill these regions, and resplats the modified multi-view observations back to 3D while maintaining consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show TIRE significantly improves identity preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed TIRE method effectively addresses the challenge of semantic identity preservation in subject-driven 3D/4D generation through its track-inpaint-resplat pipeline.

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, showing that bounding box prompts outperform automatic and single point approaches, with Box+MP achieving the best performance (0.64 mIoU). Lightweight variants like TinySAM and MobileSAM are suitable for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire segmentation is challenging due to flames' irregular boundaries and variable intensities. While SAM models show cross-domain generalization, their effectiveness in fire segmentation under mobile constraints remains unexplored.

Method: Systematically evaluated four SAM2.1 variants and mobile-oriented variants across three fire datasets using multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single point, multiple points, bounding box, and hybrid approaches.

Result: Bounding box prompts consistently outperformed other methods, with Box+MP achieving highest mean IoU (0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75). Lightweight variants significantly reduced memory and computational costs.

Conclusion: This work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for domain-specific SAM applications.

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [18] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models that uses noise injection and analyzes noise distribution aggregation to distinguish between training and non-training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion pose privacy risks through potential membership inference attacks, where attackers can determine if specific data was used in training.

Method: Inject slight noise into test images and evaluate the aggregation degree of noise distribution predicted by the diffusion model around certain time steps.

Result: Achieves superior performance across multiple datasets and shows better attack effects in ASR and AUC metrics when applied to large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, requires fewer model visits than existing approaches, and demonstrates scalability for membership inference attacks against diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AVEP (Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a new task for predicting subsequent events in videos, and presents a large annotated dataset with 35K videos and 178K clips. They propose EventFormer, a hierarchical attention model that outperforms existing video prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current script event induction research focuses on text-based scripts, but human events are mostly recorded in videos. There's a lack of research on video event prediction that incorporates complex logic and rich semantic information.

Method: Proposed EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical attention model that captures relationships between events and their arguments, as well as coreferencial relationships between arguments. Built a large structured dataset with fine-grained multimodal event argument annotations.

Result: EventFormer outperforms several state-of-the-art video prediction models and LVLMs on the AVEP task. The experiments demonstrate both the complexity of the task and the value of the proposed dataset.

Conclusion: AVEP represents a challenging video prediction task requiring complex logic understanding. The proposed EventFormer model and structured dataset provide effective solutions for action-centric video event prediction, showing superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

*Le Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a mismatch reconstruction theory for multimode fiber imaging when the measurement matrix is unknown, solving the problem of image reconstruction without requiring strict matrix matching through novel algorithms and mathematical proofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimode fiber imaging fails when measurement matrices are unknown due to system configuration issues or fiber bending, creating a need for reconstruction methods that don't require exact matrix knowledge.

Method: Proposed mismatch equation with matched and calibration solution algorithms to construct new measurement matrices, supported by detailed mathematical proofs in the appendix.

Result: Successfully reconstructed original images under low noise conditions using constructed matrices with traditional algorithms, demonstrating robustness against noise, computational precision, and orthogonality issues.

Conclusion: The proposed mismatch reconstruction theory effectively solves the unknown measurement matrix problem in multimode fiber imaging, showing practical applicability despite some limitations.

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection benefits from integrating 2D and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging.

Method: Proposes MAFR framework with shared fusion encoder for RGB images and point clouds, followed by attention-guided modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are detected by measuring reconstruction errors between input features and restored counterparts.

Conclusion: MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial anomaly detection.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D

novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITA is a lightweight framework that reduces hallucinations in Vision-Language Models by providing token-level inference-time alignment using a frozen reward model, achieving significant improvements across multiple benchmarks with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs suffer from hallucination issues where generated text doesn't align with visual inputs, and existing alignment methods require expensive fine-tuning or provide only coarse feedback.

Method: Freezes the base VLM and trains a separate reward model to approximate its distribution, then uses log-probability ratios between the reward model and target VLM to provide dense autoregressive feedback during inference.

Result: Achieved consistent gains across 12 benchmarks: 8.6% improvement on MMVet and 6.7% on POPE, with comparable gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy.

Conclusion: TITA effectively reduces hallucinations in VLMs through token-level inference-time alignment without retraining the backbone model, demonstrating strong generalization and minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: Proposes HIBA architecture with hierarchical sparse attention for time series foundation models, enabling multi-scale dependency capture. Introduces Xihe model family (9.5M to 1.5B parameters) that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series foundation models directly adopt cross-domain architectures from language models, which limits their ability to effectively capture multiscale temporal dependencies in time series data, especially during zero-shot transfer across datasets with different patterns and sampling strategies.

Method: Hierarchical Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) with hierarchical inter- and intra-block sparse attention. Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, while inter-block attention captures global temporal pattern interaction and dynamic evolution.

Result: Xihe-tiny (9.5M parameters) surpasses most contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on GIFT-Eval benchmark, surpassing previous best results by substantial margin.

Conclusion: The consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and architectural superiority of HIBA in time series foundation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Motivation: Standard deep learning models struggle to capture subtle morphological details in knee osteoarthritis diagnosis from radiographs, necessitating better integration of anatomical structure information.

Method: Propose a multimodal framework that integrates morphological graph representations from SAM segmentations with vision encoders, enforcing alignment between geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual information maximization.

Result: Achieves up to 10% improvement in accuracy (reaching nearly 80%) over single-modality baselines, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 8% in accuracy and 11% in F1 score on the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis is critical for accurate knee osteoarthritis severity grading, as demonstrated by the significant performance improvements of the proposed multimodal approach.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method using two parallel denoising samplers with limited steps improves diffusion model sampling quality through appropriate information integration, without requiring fine-tuning or external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of sampled images from diffusion models when constrained by a limited number of denoising steps, addressing the challenge of computational efficiency.

Method: Two parallel processors/samplers perform denoising steps at successive times and integrate their information appropriately in the latent image space.

Result: The method improves sample quality in both automated and human evaluations across different diffusion models, while naive integration approaches lower quality and adding more samplers doesn't necessarily help.

Conclusion: Simple parallel sampling with proper information integration can effectively enhance diffusion model performance under computational constraints without additional training requirements.

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP is a CLIP-based training framework that uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, guiding the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy for improved text-video retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in text-video retrieval including high data acquisition costs from large-scale annotated pairs and the modal gap between video and text features, while overcoming existing CLIP adaptation methods' lack of dynamic video feature enhancement and ineffective suppression of static redundant features.

Method: Proposes FDA-CLIP which uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks that are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel, proactively guiding the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP provides an effective solution for text-video alignment by leveraging dynamic region masks to enhance focus on critical video content while reducing static background interference.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

### [29] [Activating Visual Context and Commonsense Reasoning through Masked Prediction in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21807)
*Jiaao Yu,Shenwei Li,Mingjie Han,Yifei Yin,Wenzheng Song,Chenghao Jia,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel fine-tuning task called Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense (MPCC) to address the gap in multimodal reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly for vision-language tasks. It develops a specialized evaluation benchmark and proposes Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling to enhance generalized reasoning across diverse multimodal environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning models have advanced significantly in single-modal language settings but struggle with real-world multimodal scenarios, especially vision-language tasks. Existing approaches either focus on perception-centric tasks or reduce images to text, failing to fully leverage visual context and commonsense knowledge, which limits generalization across diverse multimodal environments.

Method: The paper introduces Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense (MPCC), a fine-tuning task that forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded images. It develops MPCC Eval benchmark and employs various fine-tuning strategies, including an innovative Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling method.

Result: The proposed methods enhance model performance and improve generalized reasoning capabilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and cross-task scenarios, as evaluated through the specialized MPCC Eval benchmark.

Conclusion: The MPCC framework successfully bridges the gap in multimodal reasoning by forcing models to integrate visual context and commonsense knowledge, laying the foundation for generalized reasoning across diverse multimodal environments through innovative fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

*Jiaao Yu,Mingjie Han,Jinkun Jiang,Junyu Dong,Tao Gong,Man Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRE-CLIP is a novel framework that enhances CLIP for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning by incorporating semantic relation guidance and cross-modal alignment preservation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of data annotation drives the need for training models in data-limited scenarios. Existing approaches fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, creating demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). While CLIP has inherent advantages for DAZSL, current methods don't fully exploit its potential.

Method: Proposed Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework with two key components: Semantic Relation Structure Loss for efficient cross-category knowledge transfer, and Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy to prevent degradation during target domain fine-tuning.

Result: SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches. It's the first CLIP-based DAZSL method.

Conclusion: The proposed SRE-CLIP framework successfully addresses core challenges in applying CLIP to DAZSL by enhancing semantic relation guidance and maintaining cross-modal alignment, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

*Haru Kondoh,Asako Kanezaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using language description as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning for multimodal robot navigation to create explainable systems without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal robot navigation systems are becoming complex black-boxes, creating a reliability issue. There's a trade-off where explainable systems typically underperform non-explainable ones, which the authors aim to overcome.

Method: Incorporates action description in language as an auxiliary task in reinforcement learning, using knowledge distillation from pre-trained vision-language models to address the lack of ground-truth data for descriptions.

Result: The approach successfully describes actions while maintaining high navigation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in challenging semantic audio-visual navigation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the gap between explainability and performance in multimodal navigation systems, demonstrating that language-based action description can be successfully integrated without compromising navigation capabilities.

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

*Arpan Maity,Aviroop Pal,MD. Samiul Islam,Tamal Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid AI framework combining traditional feature extraction with deep learning for enhanced diabetic retinopathy detection, improving early diagnosis accuracy and reducing false negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic Retinopathy is a major vision-threatening complication affecting India's large diabetic population, requiring early screening since it's asymptomatic initially. Current approaches need improvement in detection accuracy.

Method: Hybrid diagnostic framework that combines traditional handcrafted feature extraction (capturing clinical markers) with deep learning (automating hierarchical pattern recognition) for multimodal analysis.

Result: The hybrid model demonstrates superior classification performance compared to standalone deep learning approaches, with improved accuracy and reduced false negatives.

Conclusion: This multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable and accurate DR screening, which is crucial for diabetes-burdened regions like India, providing better early detection capabilities.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Conclusion: YOLOv11's outstanding performance in both accuracy and speed makes it the most effective model for surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, significantly surpassing competing algorithms.

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,

*Samuel J. Barrett,Docko Sow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO is a decoder-only generative model for Earth Observation data that uses unified token sequences to perform multiple tasks without task-specific adaptation, outperforming larger models on crop classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing EO foundation models that require adaptation and are rigidly structured around specific data sources or training approaches, by taking inspiration from large language models' unified sequence approach.

Method: Uses a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture with symbolic prompting to perform multiple supervised and self-supervised tasks within a single unified framework, leveraging dense temporal sequence modeling without spatial context.

Result: Outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type classification (PASTIS-R), demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modeling is critical for EO tasks.

Conclusion: SITS-DECO exemplifies a data-centric modeling paradigm where capability arises from training data diversity and structure rather than architectural complexity, providing a lightweight route to multi-modal, multi-task EO modeling.

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gestura is an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding that uses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model enhanced with a Landmark Processing Module and Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve accuracy and response times over existing solutions like GestureGPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solutions for free-form gesture understanding suffer from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times, constraining practical human-computer interaction applications.

Method: Gestura combines a pre-trained LVLM with a Landmark Processing Module that embeds anatomical hand priors to capture subtle movements, and uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning for step-by-step semantic inference of ambiguous gestures.

Result: The system achieves robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension and includes the first open-source dataset with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs for gesture intention reasoning.

Conclusion: Gestura significantly enhances free-form gesture understanding through LVLM alignment, anatomical hand priors, and CoT reasoning, enabling more effective human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A wavelet-based method using DWT preprocessing and ResNet50 classifier effectively detects StyleGAN-generated images by analyzing wavelet-domain artifacts, achieving 95.1% accuracy with Daubechies filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying GAN-generated images has become a significant challenge in digital image forensics, requiring effective detection methods.

Method: Uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) preprocessing with Haar and Daubechies filters to convert images into multi-resolution representations, then feeds them to a ResNet50 network for classification.

Result: Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved 93.8% and 95.1% accuracy respectively, significantly outperforming spatial domain model (81.5%). Daubechies-based model performed best.

Conclusion: GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints," and wavelet-domain analysis is highly effective for GAN image detection, with potential for improving deepfake detection systems.

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of interpretability in most deep learning models hampers clinical trust and adoption in medical imaging diagnostics.

Method: Used ResNet50 and DenseNet121 CNNs trained on Kaggle datasets (7,023 brain MRI and 5,863 chest X-ray images) with integrated Grad-CAM for explainability through heatmap visualizations.

Result: DenseNet121 outperformed ResNet50 with 94.3% vs. 92.5% accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1% vs. 84.4% for pneumonia. Grad-CAM showed DenseNet121 focused on core pathological regions while ResNet50 sometimes scattered attention.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable, interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

TL;DR: This paper proposes reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features to improve chromosome classification precision in low-quality image settings, achieving over 90% accuracy for chromosomes with common defects and translocations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current karyotyping systems require high-quality training data which is unavailable in some pathological laboratories. The goal is to prevent false positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality image settings.

Method: Uses reliability thresholding metrics and engineered features with various classifiers including deep Alex-Net neural network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines for automated filtering of semi-straight chromosomes.

Result: Classification results improved over 90% for chromosomes with common defects and translocations. The method was validated on a very low-quality G-banding database.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and pruning method are suitable for karyotyping facilities in poor countries and low-budget pathological laboratories, providing high precision results even with low-quality data.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

*Yichi Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Lingbing Guo,Lei Liang,Wen Zhang,Huajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of multi-modal relational knowledge (MMRK) reasoning in MLLMs by introducing an automatic data engine and two-stage training framework, achieving superior performance with smaller models compared to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with understanding and reasoning about abstractive visual information, particularly Multi-Modal Relational Knowledge (MMRK) representing abstract relational structures between multi-modal entities. There are significant gaps in both large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement methodologies for structured and abstractive reasoning (STAR).

Method: The paper introduces: (1) An automatic STAR data engine that synthesizes images with MMRK to build multi-modal instruction data with chain-of-thought thinking, and (2) A comprehensive two-stage capability enhancement training framework with tailored evaluation protocols for different STAR tasks. This creates the STAR-64K dataset with 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples.

Result: Experimental results across 5 open-source MLLMs show that the two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR tasks. The paper also provides in-depth analysis of design effectiveness, data transferability, and scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gaps in MMRK reasoning by providing both the necessary data infrastructure (STAR-64K dataset) and effective training methodology, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve superior performance in structured and abstractive reasoning tasks compared to larger models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

*Yi Yin,Yuntao Shou,Zao Dai,Yun Peng,Tao Meng,Wei Ai,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining low-rank Transformer with flow-based generative model for robust multimodal survival prediction with incomplete medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world medical datasets often have incomplete modalities due to acquisition limitations, and existing methods ignore distributional discrepancies across modalities, leading to unreliable reconstruction.

Method: Uses class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment, normalizing flow model for distribution-consistent latent space construction, and lightweight low-rank Transformer for intra-modal dependencies and overfitting prevention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings and maintains robust accuracy with incomplete modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses incomplete multimodal survival analysis by ensuring distribution consistency and handling modality dependencies through flow-based alignment and Transformer architecture.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPT-4o was tested for zero-shot chest X-ray classification (NORMAL vs PNEUMONIA) using 400 images. Feature-focused prompts achieved 74% accuracy, while reasoning-based prompts performed worse, showing limited diagnostic reliability for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate GPT-4o's zero-shot capability for medical image classification without fine-tuning, assessing its potential for clinical applications.

Method: Used 400 balanced chest X-ray images (200 per class) with four different prompt designs: minimal instructions to detailed reasoning-based prompts in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Concise, feature-focused prompts achieved highest accuracy of 74%, while reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in lower performance.

Conclusion: GPT-4o shows emerging potential for medical image interpretation but has limited diagnostic reliability; requires advances in visual reasoning and domain adaptation before clinical use.

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

### [44] [RatioWaveNet: A Learnable RDWT Front-End for Robust and Interpretable EEG Motor-Imagery Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21841)
*Marco Siino,Giuseppe Bonomo,Rosario Sorbello,Ilenia Tinnirello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet enhances EEG-based motor imagery BCIs by adding a trainable wavelet transform front end to a CNN-Transformer backbone, improving robustness especially for challenging subjects while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-invasive EEG-based motor imagery BCIs face challenges due to nonstationarity, low signal-to-noise ratio, and subject variability, particularly struggling with the most difficult subjects.

Method: Combines a trainable Rationally-Dilated Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end with a TCFormer backbone (temporal CNN-Transformer), using multi-resolution subband decomposition, grouped 1-D convolutions, multi-kernel CNN, grouped-query attention encoder, and compact TCN head.

Result: On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b datasets, RatioWaveNet improved worst-subject accuracy by +0.17/+0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent/LOSO) on 2a and +1.07/+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest computational overhead.

Conclusion: A simple, trainable wavelet front end effectively strengthens Transformer-based BCIs, improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

*Michael Aerni,Joshua Swanson,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current unified multimodal models exhibit modal aphasia - they can accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate them in writing, despite being trained on both images and text simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and study a systematic dissociation in multimodal models where they show strong visual concept memorization but poor textual articulation, and to understand the safety implications of this phenomenon.

Method: Conducted experiments using leading frontier models and controlled experiments on synthetic datasets across multiple architectures, testing visual generation versus textual description capabilities.

Result: Models can generate near-perfect reproductions of iconic movie artwork but confuse crucial details in textual descriptions. Modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of current unified multimodal models, not just a training artifact.

Conclusion: Modal aphasia introduces vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks, as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in other modalities. Models aligned solely on text can still generate unsafe images.

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM is a vision-language model that uses Chain of Scroll mechanism for efficient long-context document navigation, reducing memory usage while modeling human-like reading patterns for GUI control and web navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models struggle with long-context visual information in agentic tasks like GUI control and web navigation, as they neglect decision-oriented document understanding and use memory-intensive approaches that are impractical for local deployment.

Method: Proposes SCoPE VLM with Chain of Scroll mechanism for selective and recursive document navigation, a dedicated data generation pipeline for Chain of Scroll trajectories, and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization reinforcement learning method to bridge training-inference gaps.

Result: The method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like reading behaviors, making it the first framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document question answering.

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM advances multimodal agent capabilities by providing an efficient solution for long-context visual information processing in document navigation tasks, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

*Anthony Zhang,Mahmut Gokmen,Dennis Hein,Rongjun Ge,Wenjun Xia,Ge Wang,Jin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFCT enables training Poisson Flow Consistency Models without distillation by using perturbation kernels, sinusoidal discretization, and Beta noise distribution, achieving competitive CT image denoising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM was limited to distillation training, restricting its potential across data modalities. PFCT was developed to train PFCM independently without needing pretrained PFGM++.

Method: Leveraged perturbation kernel to remove dependency on pretrained PFGM++, introduced sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution for adaptability and improved sample quality.

Result: Improved low dose CT image denoising in terms of LPIPS and SSIM metrics, showed similar denoising effectiveness as Consistency Model and other generative models.

Conclusion: PFCT is a valid training method for PFCM that creates more flexibility in generative modeling applications, though further optimization and applicability studies are needed.

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WM-MoE is a world model-based motion forecasting framework that addresses corner-case scenarios in autonomous driving by unifying perception, temporal memory, and decision making, leveraging LLMs for temporal reasoning and using mixture-of-experts for scenario decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion forecasting models underperform in rare but safety-critical corner cases due to over-representation of common scenes in training data and limited generalization capabilities, which poses safety risks for autonomous vehicles.

Method: The framework constructs compact scene representations, uses a lightweight temporal tokenizer to map trajectories into LLM feature space, employs mixture-of-experts to decompose corner cases into subproblems, and includes specialized experts for intent inference and counterfactual rollouts.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, MoCAD) show WM-MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and remains robust under corner-case and data-missing conditions.

Conclusion: World model-based architectures like WM-MoE show promise for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in autonomous vehicles, particularly for handling challenging corner-case scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) in Diffusion Transformers while preserving quality, achieving 9.8x training savings with comparable performance through sparse-dense residual fusion and two-stage training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from quadratic training costs with sequence length, making large-scale pretraining prohibitively expensive. Existing token dropping methods either degrade representations, are parameter-heavy, or fail at high drop ratios.

Method: SPRINT uses sparse-dense residual fusion: early layers process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse subset to reduce computation, and their outputs are fused through residual connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning.

Result: On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training savings with comparable FID/FDD metrics. At inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG) nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality.

Conclusion: SPRINT establishes itself as a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training, enabling aggressive token dropping while preserving generative quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as

TL;DR: Lite-Diff introduces lightweight adaptation layers for diffusion models, enabling efficient fine-tuning with minimal computational cost and reduced overfitting in data-scarce domains like medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning diffusion models for specialized domains is challenging due to limited domain-specific data and high computational costs of full model adaptation.

Method: Integrates lightweight adaptation layers into frozen diffusion U-Net, uses latent morphological autoencoder for domain-specific latent consistency, and pixel-level discriminator for adversarial alignment.

Result: Achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning on three chest X-ray datasets, with optimal balance between efficiency and performance.

Conclusion: Provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion models, facilitating deployment in diverse low-data domains.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowOpt is a zero-order optimization framework that treats diffusion/flow-matching models as black boxes, enabling efficient optimization through the entire sampling path without gradient computation, achieving state-of-the-art results for image editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlled generation with diffusion models are computationally impractical due to iterative sampling processes, requiring gradient-based optimization at each timestep separately.

Method: Proposes a gradient-free optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box, allowing optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation, with provable convergence guarantees.

Result: FlowOpt achieves state-of-the-art results for image editing tasks (inversion and text-guided editing) while using roughly the same number of neural function evaluations as existing methods.

Conclusion: FlowOpt provides an efficient and practical alternative to gradient-based methods for controlling diffusion models, enabling optimization through the entire sampling process with monitoring capabilities and early stopping.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Motivation: Current saliency map XAI methods can be misleading when spurious and salient features overlap in pixel space, creating robustness issues in ML models.

Method: Integrates standalone models into CLIP using network surgery approach to create caption-based explanations that identify dominant concepts contributing to predictions.

Result: The proposed method minimizes the risk of models falling for covariate shifts by providing more reliable explanations that highlight true dominant concepts rather than potentially misleading pixel-level features.

Conclusion: Caption-based XAI through CLIP integration significantly contributes to developing more robust ML models by addressing limitations of traditional saliency map approaches.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-SlideEval is a framework that evaluates vision-language models' ability to understand presentation slides across element extraction, robustness to perturbations, and narrative comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal content like presentation slides, but their slide-specific understanding capabilities remain underexplored despite their growing role in agentic pipelines.

Method: The framework probes VLMs along three axes: element-level extraction aligned to ground truth, robustness to controlled perturbations in geometry/style/text, and higher-level comprehension including recovering narrative order from shuffled slides. Uses standardized ground-truth metadata from PowerPoint XML and live renderings.

Result: VLMs underperform on pixel-accurate extraction, show non-trivial agreement/fidelity/consistency under perturbations, perform better on single-slide content understanding, but do not reliably capture narrative structure across slides.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have limitations for slide evaluation, motivating the need for calibrated, critic-in-the-loop evaluators that drive iterative refinement in agentic pipelines.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust deep learning framework for multi-class anomaly detection in surveillance videos that uses human-centric preprocessing with YOLO-World and ByteTrack, followed by spatio-temporal modeling with InceptionV3 and BiLSTM, achieving 92.41% accuracy on UCF-Crime dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in surveillance video anomaly detection including diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual clutter by focusing on behaviorally relevant foreground content.

Method: Human-centric preprocessing using YOLO-World for human detection and ByteTrack for identity-aware tracking, with background suppression via Gaussian blurring. Spatial features extracted by InceptionV3 and temporal dynamics captured by BiLSTM for sequence classification.

Result: Achieved 92.41% mean test accuracy on five-class UCF-Crime subset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), with per-class F1-scores consistently above 0.85. Strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance demonstrated through comprehensive metrics.

Conclusion: Foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

### [59] [Capturing Gaze Shifts for Guidance: Cross-Modal Fusion Enhancement for VLM Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22067)
*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GIFT is a method that reduces hallucination in vision language models by tracking gaze shifts to create visual saliency maps, then amplifying attention to both salient visual regions and user queries for balanced cross-modal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate hallucinated content due to over-reliance on linguistic priors and visual attention sink problems where attention is misallocated to irrelevant visual regions, while existing methods fail to address cross-modal fusion balance.

Method: Pre-computes holistic visual saliency maps by tracking positive changes in visual attention (gaze shifts) during query comprehension, then amplifies attention to both salient visual information and user queries at each decoding step.

Result: Achieves up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding in reducing hallucination across generative and classification tasks while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: GIFT effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs by addressing visual attention sink problems and ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion through gaze shift-guided attention enhancement.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

TL;DR: A novel MRI harmonization framework that disentangles anatomical content from scanner-specific variations using SSIM-based loss, improving cross-site consistency and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address variability in MRI data from different scanners, protocols, and sites that hinders consistent analysis and generalizability in multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Method: Image-based harmonization framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI using differentiable SSIM loss to separate anatomical content from scanner variations, with training on multiple public datasets across diverse scanners and sites.

Result: Harmonized images achieved strong alignment across acquisition settings (structural SSIM: 0.97, luminance SSIM: 0.98-0.99) with substantial improvements in downstream tasks: brain age prediction MAE decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85.

Conclusion: The framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

### [61] [Mitigating Coordinate Prediction Bias from Positional Encoding Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22102)
*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yihong Luo,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with precise coordinate prediction in high-resolution images due to weakened positional encodings. The paper proposes VPSG, a training-free method that corrects directional biases by using shuffled positional encodings as negative guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs excel at vision-language tasks but fail at precise coordinate prediction, especially with high-resolution inputs that produce long token sequences and weaken positional encodings, causing directional biases in coordinate outputs.

Method: Proposed Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG) - a training-free test-time method that runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled visual positional encodings to isolate position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight finite-state machine.

Result: Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable improvements, showing that VPSG effectively corrects directional biases and improves coordinate prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Positional encoding robustness is a critical factor for spatial reasoning in MLLMs, and the proposed VPSG method successfully addresses the coordinate prediction challenges by leveraging the directional nature of positional biases.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rainbow is a conditional image generation framework that decomposes input conditions into diverse latent representations using GFlowNets to capture uncertainty and generate multiple plausible images from ambiguous prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for diverse image generation either modify random seeds (creating hard-to-interpret differences) or diversify input prompts (limited in verbal interpretability), failing to properly address inherent condition uncertainty that leads to multiple plausible outputs.

Method: Rainbow integrates a latent graph parameterized by GFlowNets into prompt representation computation, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities to produce multiple trajectories that represent different aspects of input condition uncertainty, leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding images.

Result: Evaluations on natural and medical image datasets show Rainbow improves both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image generation, and counterfactual generation tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Rainbow provides an effective framework for generating diverse plausible images from uncertain conditions by decomposing input conditions into diverse latent representations using GFlowNets, addressing limitations of traditional diversity generation approaches.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAID is a framework that generates high-quality spatial reasoning datasets using 2D bounding boxes from object detectors, avoiding errors from 3D reconstruction and generative hallucinations. It produces datasets with 91.16% human-validated accuracy compared to 57.6% from existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning, and existing dataset generation methods have limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading errors requiring wide tolerances, while caption-based methods need hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations.

Method: GRAID operates exclusively on 2D geometric primitives (bounding boxes) from standard object detectors to determine qualitative spatial relationships, avoiding both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations.

Result: Generated over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs across BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets with 91.16% human-validated accuracy. Models trained on GRAID data show strong generalization, improving on held-out question types by 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages.

Conclusion: GRAID provides a reliable framework for generating high-quality spatial reasoning datasets that significantly improve VLM performance on spatial reasoning tasks and demonstrate strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%

TL;DR: CogStereo is a novel stereo matching framework that embeds implicit spatial cognition using monocular depth features as priors to handle challenging regions like occlusions and weak textures, achieving state-of-the-art performance and excellent cross-domain generalization without dataset-specific priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep stereo matching methods lack the zero-shot generalization capabilities seen in foundation models for other vision tasks, particularly struggling with challenging regions such as occlusions and weak textures where geometry alone is inadequate.

Method: CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition into refinement using monocular depth features as priors, employing a dual-conditional refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided features for global correction of mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world datasets show CogStereo achieves state-of-the-art results and excels in cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CogStereo shifts stereo vision towards a cognition-driven approach, demonstrating structurally coherent disparity estimation even in challenging regions and superior generalization capabilities without relying on dataset-specific priors.

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP models suffer from embedding variance collapse under distribution shifts, where both intra-class and inter-class variances decrease with corruption severity. The authors propose Mint, a test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance to improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained vision-language models like CLIP show strong zero-shot generalization but are vulnerable to input corruptions, leading to performance degradation. The authors investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image embeddings and discover embedding variance collapse as a key issue.

Method: The authors analyze how corruptions alter embedding space structure and propose Mint - a test-time adaptation method that maximizes pseudo-label-based inter-class variance using a mean accumulator and gradient accumulator. Mint works with small batch sizes and operates on the fly.

Result: Mint consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and CLIP architectures, demonstrating enhanced embedding quality and robustness to distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Embedding variance collapse is a key factor in CLIP's vulnerability to corruptions. Maximizing inter-class variance, even with pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality, and the proposed Mint method effectively addresses this issue across various settings.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

TL;DR: The paper introduces egoEMOTION, the first dataset combining egocentric visual and physiological data with emotion and personality self-reports, enabling affect-aware vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current egocentric vision benchmarks ignore emotional states that drive human behavior, focusing only on physical activities and assuming neutral affect, limiting systems' ability to understand internal behavioral drivers.

Method: Created egoEMOTION dataset with 50+ hours of recordings from 43 participants using Meta's Project Aria glasses, capturing synchronized eye-tracking video, photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines with emotion/personality self-reports.

Result: A classical learning-based method showed better affect prediction from egocentric vision signals than from physiological signals alone, establishing the viability of emotion recognition in egocentric perception.

Conclusion: The dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in egocentric perception, opening new directions for affect-driven modeling of behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

TL;DR: STG-Avatar is a 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction that combines Spacetime Gaussians with linear blend skinning to address challenges in representing detailed clothing deformations and dynamic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS-based human avatars struggle with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects like clothing deformations and dynamic regions such as rapidly moving limbs, which is crucial for realistic human-robot interaction and immersive virtual experiences.

Method: The framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS). LBS enables real-time skeletal control for global pose transformations, while STG provides spacetime adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Optical flow is used to identify high-dynamic regions and guide adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics while retaining real-time rendering capabilities.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar provides an effective solution for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction by combining the strengths of Spacetime Gaussians and linear blend skinning, addressing key challenges in representing non-rigid deformations and dynamic regions.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method

TL;DR: LOC is a language-guided framework for 3D scene understanding that adapts to occupancy networks, supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models show promise for open-set challenges but face limitations in 3D scene understanding due to scarce 3D datasets. The paper aims to bridge this gap by developing a framework that effectively applies VLMs to 3D occupancy networks.

Method: Proposes LOC framework with multi-frame LiDAR fusion for dynamic/static scenes, Poisson reconstruction for void filling, KNN for voxel semantics, and Densely Contrastive Learning (DCL) to prevent feature over-homogenization. Uses CLIP feature space for voxel embedding and text-image integration.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show superior performance with high-precision predictions for known classes and effective distinction of unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: LOC provides an effective language-guided approach for 3D scene understanding that works with both supervised and self-supervised learning, achieving strong open-set recognition capabilities without requiring dense pixel-level supervision.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARFNet is a novel contrastive learning framework for source-free domain adaptation that addresses negative transfer and domain shift through attention residual fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFDA approaches focus on domain shift but neglect negative transfer effects that hinder model performance improvement during adaptation. The complexity of scene information and lack of source domain data make SFDA challenging.

Method: Proposes ARFNet with three key components: 1) Attention residual fusion using spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions for cross-layer fusion and self-distillation, 2) Global-local attention contrast to improve perceptual capabilities and discriminate intra/inter-class variations, 3) Dynamic centroid evaluation to assess trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised self-distillation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks show the method surpasses other techniques and achieves superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARFNet effectively alleviates negative transfer and domain shift in SFDA through its attention-based contrastive learning framework, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2-NeRF is a neural radiance field framework that improves 3D physical world perception by achieving isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation through reverse-stratified upsampling and a unified radiative formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance generative AI's 3D physical world perception capabilities, particularly addressing limitations in existing NeRF models that rely on object-centric sampling and struggle with media degradation effects like underwater scenes, haze, and low-light conditions.

Method: Introduces reverse-stratified upsampling for near-uniform 3D space sampling to preserve isometry, and presents a general radiative formulation unifying emission, absorption, and scattering using a particle model based on Beer-Lambert attenuation law, enabling composition of direct and media-induced in-scatter radiance.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and physical plausibility compared to existing approaches, with the ability to estimate medium properties like water depth.

Conclusion: I2-NeRF successfully enables isotropic metric perception in complex media environments and provides a unified framework for handling various degradation scenarios while maintaining physical accuracy.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

### [71] [HARMONY: Hidden Activation Representations and Model Output-Aware Uncertainty Estimation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22171)
*Erum Mushtaq,Zalan Fabian,Yavuz Faruk Bakman,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi,Salman Avestimehr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HARMONY is a novel uncertainty estimation framework for Vision-Language Models that jointly leverages multimodal activations and output distributions to assess response reliability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty estimation methods for VLMs either rely solely on output probabilities or hidden representations, failing to capture complex multimodal relationships and often being influenced by language priors. There's a need for more reliable uncertainty assessment in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving and assistive technologies.

Method: Proposes HARMONY framework that combines both fused multimodal information from model activations and output probability distributions to determine response reliability. The approach captures both the model's internal belief in visual understanding and token probabilities.

Result: Experimental results on A-OKVQA, VizWiz, and PathVQA benchmarks with LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and InstructBLIP show consistent performance improvements, achieving up to 4% improvement in AUROC and 6% in PRR, establishing new state-of-the-art in uncertainty estimation for VLMs.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging both model activations and output distributions provides superior uncertainty estimation compared to approaches using only one component, demonstrating the value of combining internal belief signals with probability-based measures for reliable VLM assessment.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

*Vincent Lu,Aaron Truong,Zeyu Yun,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple non-parametric generative model based on three natural image principles produces high-fidelity samples without training, offering insights into how neural networks generalize.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind photorealistic image generation by stripping away complex engineering and proposing a minimal, interpretable model grounded in natural image properties.

Method: A non-parametric generative model that defines each pixel's distribution from its local context window, based on three principles: spatial non-stationarity, low-level regularities, and high-level semantics.

Result: The model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually compelling CIFAR-10 images despite minimal architecture and no training, demonstrating strong empirical performance.

Conclusion: The model's white-box nature reveals a compositional procedure for part-whole generalization, suggesting a hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

### [74] [TrajGATFormer: A Graph-Based Transformer Approach for Worker and Obstacle Trajectory Prediction in Off-site Construction Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22205)
*Mohammed Alduais,Xinming Li,Qipei Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework combining YOLOv10n and DeepSORT for worker and obstacle detection/tracking, with two novel trajectory prediction models (TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle) that use transformer encoder-decoder with Graph Attention Networks to improve safety in offsite construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offsite construction introduces new safety risks due to close interactions between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Traditional methods struggle with dynamic construction environments, while recent data-driven methods fail to capture long-term behavior and spatial-social context needed for collision risk assessment.

Method: Proposed framework integrates YOLOv10n for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking, with two trajectory prediction models using transformer encoder-decoder architecture with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.

Result: TrajGATFormer achieved ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3 m over 4.8 s horizon. TrajGATFormer-Obstacle achieved higher accuracy with ADE 1.15 m and FDE 2.2 m. Both models outperformed traditional methods, reducing ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods in dynamic construction environments, providing more accurate trajectory prediction for collision avoidance systems in offsite construction settings.

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

*Yaokun Li,Lihe Ding,Xiao Chen,Guang Tan,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicTree is a framework for generating realistic 4D motion of trees using 3D Gaussian Splatting. It uses a compact sparse voxel spectrum representation for fast feed-forward animation generation and real-time interactive responses to external forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods face challenges in generating realistic 4D motion for complex real trees, which has applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation.

Method: The approach uses a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent tree movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, it generates mesh motion using this spectrum and binds Gaussians to deform the mesh. The sparse voxel spectrum also enables fast modal analysis for real-time interactive responses to external forces.

Result: The method achieves realistic and responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both visual quality and computational efficiency. A large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset (4DTree) with 8,786 animated tree meshes was created for training.

Conclusion: DynamicTree is the first framework capable of generating long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting trees in a fast feed-forward manner, representing a significant advancement over prior optimization-based methods.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GALA, a Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation strategy that combines global k-means clustering with cluster-wise local selection to efficiently acquire target-domain annotations, achieving near-fully-supervised performance with only 1% target labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between domain adaptation methods and fully supervised learning by selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain in multi-source settings.

Method: GALA strategy combining global k-means clustering for target-domain samples with cluster-wise local selection criteria to handle inter-class diversity and multi-source domain variation.

Result: Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks show GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active DA methods, achieving performance comparable to fully-supervised upperbound with only 1% target annotations.

Conclusion: GALA is an effective plug-and-play solution for Multi-Source Active Domain Adaptation that can be seamlessly integrated into existing DA frameworks without additional parameters, significantly improving target-domain performance with minimal annotation cost.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

TL;DR: UniPAN is a novel approach that enhances pansharpening model generalizability by normalizing pixel distributions from different satellite sources to a unified distribution, enabling "train once, deploy forever" capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning pansharpening models suffer from performance degradation on unseen satellite data due to distributional discrepancies from different sensors and imaging conditions, limiting their practical applicability.

Method: Constructs a distribution transformation function that normalizes pixels from different sources to an identical distribution, trains models on the transformed domain, and transforms new test data to match the training distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPAN significantly enhances pansharpening model performance across diverse satellite sensors, validating its efficacy.

Conclusion: UniPAN successfully bridges the gap between training and testing distributions, enabling pansharpening models to maintain high performance on unseen satellite data and achieve better generalizability.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage active learning method for semantic segmentation that uses diffusion model features to select informative pixels under extreme labeling budget constraints, achieving superior performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires dense pixel-level annotations which are expensive to obtain, especially with limited labeling budgets. Current methods struggle under extreme budget constraints.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Hierarchical candidate selection using MaxHerding to choose representative pixels per image and create diverse global pool; 2) Entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) computed over multi-scale diffusion features to select most informative pixels for annotation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, Pascal-Context) show significant outperformance over existing baselines under extreme pixel-budget regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively decouples diversity and uncertainty selection, enabling high segmentation accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels through strategic use of diffusion model features.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DiffusionLane is a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection that treats the task as a denoising diffusion process in lane parameter space, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address lane detection challenges by leveraging diffusion models to progressively refine noisy lane anchors through a denoising process, overcoming limitations of traditional methods.

Method: Adds Gaussian noise to ground truth lane parameters to create noisy anchors, then uses a hybrid diffusion decoder combining global and local decoders with an auxiliary head to improve encoder feature representation during training.

Result: Achieves strong generalization and detection performance: 1%+ accuracy improvement on Carlane domain adaptation, 81.32% F1 on CULane, 96.89% accuracy on Tusimple, and 97.59% F1 on LLAMAS.

Conclusion: DiffusionLane demonstrates superior lane detection capabilities through its diffusion-based approach and hybrid decoding strategy, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Conclusion: CGRA4ML framework provides a viable path for implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA, offering superior power efficiency compared to traditional GPU solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy for real-time applications.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained

### [82] [Accident Anticipation via Temporal Occurrence Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22260)
*Tianhao Zhao,Yiyang Zou,Zihao Mao,Peilun Xiao,Yulin Huang,Hongda Yang,Yuxuan Li,Qun Li,Guobin Wu,Yutian Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new accident anticipation method that directly predicts accident scores at multiple future time steps instead of current-frame risk scoring, using precise accident timestamps for supervision and a Transformer-based architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use ambiguous binary supervision that labels all frames in accident videos as positive, ignoring the continuous variation of risk over time, which leads to unreliable learning and false alarms.

Method: Uses a snippet-level encoder to model spatial-temporal dynamics and a Transformer-based temporal decoder with dedicated temporal queries to predict accident scores for multiple future horizons simultaneously.

Result: Achieves superior performance in both recall and Time-to-Accident (TTA) under realistic false alarm rate (FAR) constraints compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm shift from current-frame risk scoring to direct future accident score prediction provides more reliable accident anticipation with reduced false alarms.

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

*Qiao Li,Jie Li,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jing Chen,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSAlign is a novel network for aerial-ground person re-identification that addresses geometric distortion and semantic misalignment through learnable thin plate spline warping and dynamic alignment modules, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial-ground person re-identification faces extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and ground imagery. Existing methods struggle with severe pose variations and spatial misalignment in cross-view matching.

Method: Proposed GSAlign with two key components: 1) Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS) Module that adaptively warps pedestrian features using learned keypoints to compensate for geometric variations, and 2) Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM) that estimates visibility-aware representation masks to highlight visible body regions and handle occlusions.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on CARGO dataset with four matching protocols shows significant improvements: +18.8% in mAP and +16.8% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods on aerial-ground setting.

Conclusion: GSAlign effectively addresses geometric distortion and semantic misalignment in aerial-ground person re-identification through joint geometric and semantic alignment, demonstrating superior performance in handling extreme viewpoint changes and occlusions.

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated

TL;DR: CityRiSE is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances Large Vision-Language Models' ability to predict urban socio-economic status by focusing on semantically meaningful visual cues, improving accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data like street view and satellite imagery, despite the importance of urban socio-economic sensing for sustainable development goals.

Method: Proposes CityRiSE framework using pure reinforcement learning with carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design to guide LVLMs toward structured, goal-oriented reasoning for socio-economic prediction.

Result: CityRiSE significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization, particularly for unseen cities and indicators, with emergent reasoning processes.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing, enabling better focus on semantically meaningful visual cues.

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.

### [86] [GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319)
*Jing Wang,Jiajun Liang,Jie Liu,Henglin Liu,Gongye Liu,Jun Zheng,Wanyuan Pang,Ao Ma,Zhenyu Xie,Xintao Wang,Meng Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard addresses systematic importance-ratio distribution shifts in GRPO-based reinforcement learning for flow-matching models, preventing implicit over-optimization through ratio normalization and gradient reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO frameworks suffer from systematic shifts in importance-ratio distribution (mean below 1, inconsistent variance across timesteps), preventing proper constraint of overconfident positive updates and causing implicit over-optimization where proxy rewards increase but essential metrics like image quality deteriorate.

Method: GRPO-Guard introduces ratio normalization to restore balanced and step-consistent importance ratios, and gradient reweighting to equalize policy gradients over noise conditions, creating a regulated clipping mechanism that stabilizes optimization without heavy KL regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks show GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or improving generation quality.

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard effectively mitigates implicit over-optimization in GRPO frameworks through simple yet effective enhancements, making learned policies more practical for real-world use without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

*Ali Javidani,Babak Nadjar Araabi,Mohammad Amin Sadeghi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised learning method that integrates graph theory to capture both intra-instance variations and inter-instance relationships using KNN graphs and GNNs, achieving significant accuracy improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional self-supervised methods focus only on intra-instance variations from augmentations but overlook important inter-instance relationships, limiting their representation learning capabilities.

Method: Constructs KNN graphs for teacher and student streams during pretraining, where nodes represent samples with latent representations and edges encode similarity. Uses GNNs for representation refinement through multi-hop message propagation.

Result: Achieves accuracy improvements of 7.3% on CIFAR-10, 3.2% on ImageNet-100, and 1.0% on ImageNet-1K compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The graph-based mechanism effectively captures inter-instance relationships and enables broader contextual integration, demonstrating superior performance in self-supervised representation learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MindHier is a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework that uses hierarchical neural embeddings and scale-aware guidance to improve image reconstruction from brain activity, outperforming diffusion-based methods in speed and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based fMRI reconstruction methods use fixed high-level embeddings that collapse hierarchical neural information and are misaligned with stage-dependent reconstruction needs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes MindHier with three components: Hierarchical fMRI Encoder for multi-level embeddings, Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment with CLIP features, and Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance that injects embeddings into autoregression at matching scales.

Result: Extensive experiments on NSD dataset show MindHier achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more deterministic results than diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: MindHier provides an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to diffusion-based methods by enabling hierarchical reconstruction that synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, similar to human visual perception.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgery is crucial for enhanced perception and decision-making, but existing methods lack intrinsic parameter estimation due to sterility constraints and specialized endoscopes with continuous zoom/rotation.

Method: Adapted Depth Anything V2 model for joint depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction, incorporating attention-based pose network and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Superior performance on SCARED and C3VD datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses intrinsic parameter estimation challenges in endoscopic surgery, enabling more accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction for surgical applications.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Recurrent Correlation-based framework for deformable image registration that dynamically relocates matching regions to efficiently handle large deformations while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for deformable image registration struggle with efficiently handling large deformations. Voxel-to-region matching is efficient but limited by locality, while region-to-region matching is computationally expensive due to excessive correlation pairs.

Method: Uses a recurrent framework that performs local matching at each step, then uses estimated offsets to guide the next search region. Features a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity and decouples motion-related and texture features to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves strong accuracy-computation trade-off, surpassing or matching state-of-the-art performance. On non-affine OASIS dataset, achieves comparable performance using only 9.5% of FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP method.

Conclusion: The recurrent correlation-based framework efficiently handles large deformations in medical image registration through dynamic region relocation, offering superior computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TDSR redefines image captioning as hierarchical refinement planning using MCTS with visual-guided parallel expansion and lightweight value network, reducing VLM calls by 10x while improving performance on fine-grained description, compositional generalization, and hallucination suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs face contradiction in image captioning - powerful single-step generation leads to myopic decision-making, making it difficult to maintain global narrative coherence while capturing rich details, especially in multi-step complex scene descriptions.

Method: Propose Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR) framework that models generation as Markov Decision Process, uses efficient MCTS algorithm with visual-guided parallel expansion and lightweight value network, and includes adaptive early stopping mechanism.

Result: TDSR reduces VLM call frequency by an order of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality, achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results on DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE benchmarks, enhancing performance of existing VLMs like LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: TDSR effectively addresses the fundamental challenge in VLM-based image captioning by treating it as goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning, enabling better global coherence and detail capture while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

*Ghazal Farhani,Taufiq Rahman,Syed Mostaquim Ali,Andrew Liu,Mohamed Zaki,Dominique Charlebois,Benoit Anctil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes LiDAR performance degradation in snowy conditions, develops a physics-based model to simulate signal attenuation from snowfall, and evaluates its impact on object detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR sensors provide excellent situational awareness for autonomous driving but suffer significant performance degradation in adverse weather like snowfall, which hasn't been adequately quantified. This study aims to understand LiDAR failure modes in snowy conditions.

Method: Developed a physics-based model to examine LiDAR signal attenuation with different snowfall rates and snow particle reflection effects. Used the model to transform clear-weather LiDAR data into synthetic snowy scenarios for comparison with real snowy conditions.

Result: The study successfully created synthetic snowy LiDAR data that matches real snowy conditions and used this data to assess how different snowfall rates affect pre-trained object detection model performance.

Conclusion: The physics-based model enables quantification of LiDAR performance degradation in snowfall and provides synthetic data to evaluate object detection models under various snowy conditions, addressing a critical gap in autonomous driving system reliability.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under

*Vijay Veerabadran,Fanyi Xiao,Nitin Kamra,Pedro Matias,Joy Chen,Caley Drooff,Brett D Roads,Riley Williams,Ethan Henderson,Xuanyi Zhao,Kevin Carlberg,Joseph Tighe,Karl Ridgeway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAGIBench is a new benchmark for evaluating goal inference in wearable assistive agents using vision-language models, featuring 29 hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the interaction effort with wearable assistive agents by enabling automatic goal inference from multimodal contextual observations, addressing a gap in existing research.

Method: Created WAGIBench with a novel dataset containing visual, audio, digital, and longitudinal contextual observations with ground-truth goals. Evaluated multiple families of modern vision-language models through generative and multiple-choice benchmarks.

Result: Human performance (93% accuracy) exceeds best VLM performance (84%). Larger models perform better but remain far from practical usefulness (55% relevant goal generation). Models benefit from relevant modalities with minimal degradation from irrelevant ones.

Conclusion: Current vision-language models show promise but are not yet practically useful for goal inference in wearable assistive agents, with significant room for improvement needed to reach human-level performance.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised framework for particle picking in CryoET that combines heatmap-supervised detection with teacher-student co-training to leverage unlabeled data, achieving 10% F1 improvement over supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle picking remains the main bottleneck in CryoET analysis due to reliance on time-consuming manual labels, leaving vast unlabeled tomograms underutilized.

Method: End-to-end heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, teacher-student co-training mechanism, multi-view pseudo-labeling, and CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation.

Result: Extensive evaluations on CZII dataset show 10% F1 improvement over supervised baselines.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the promise of semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data to overcome particle picking bottlenecks.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaPose4D is a novel framework that generates high-quality 4D dynamic content from single static images by integrating 4D Gaussian Splatting with Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation, achieving excellent motion coherence and fluidity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with modeling temporal dependencies and capturing dynamic geometry changes from single static images, especially with varying camera perspectives, creating a need for better 4D content generation solutions.

Method: The framework uses 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct 3D models from single images, then predicts multi-view pose keypoints using one-shot support from a chosen view with supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and fluidity in dynamic motion generation.

Conclusion: The findings validate DynaPose4D's efficacy and indicate its potential applications in computer vision and animation production domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

### [98] [Single-Teacher View Augmentation: Boosting Knowledge Distillation via Angular Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22480)
*Seonghoon Yu,Dongjun Nam,Dina Katabi,Jeany Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a cost-efficient knowledge distillation method that generates diverse multi-views from a single teacher using angular diversity objectives, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods require multiple teacher networks for diverse perspectives, which is computationally expensive. This work aims to achieve similar diversity benefits using only a single teacher.

Method: Attach multiple branches to a single teacher network and introduce two angular diversity objectives: constrained inter-angle diversify loss (maximizes angles between views while preserving proximity to teacher output) and intra-angle diversify loss (encourages even distribution of views around original output).

Result: The method surpasses existing knowledge augmentation approaches across diverse configurations and is compatible with other KD frameworks in plug-and-play fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Conclusion: The proposed angular diversity objectives effectively increase ensemble diversity from a single teacher, reduce the upper bound of ensemble expected loss, and enable more effective knowledge distillation with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

*Yang Tian,Fan Liu,Jingyuan Zhang,Wei Bi,Yupeng Hu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORIG is an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework that improves factual image generation by iteratively retrieving and filtering web evidence to create enriched prompts, addressing the issue of factual inconsistencies in Large Multimodal Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models often produce images that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially with fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional retrieval-augmented approaches fail due to static sources and shallow evidence integration.

Method: ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence from the web, then incrementally integrates refined knowledge into enriched prompts to guide generation. The framework includes FIG-Eval benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional, and temporal dimensions.

Result: Experiments show ORIG substantially improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation.

Conclusion: ORIG highlights the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image generation, successfully addressing factual inconsistencies in LMM outputs through iterative evidence retrieval and prompt enrichment.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

*Yen-Hong Wong,Lai-Kuan Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AesCrop is a composition-aware hybrid image cropping model that uses VMamba encoder with Mamba Composition Attention Bias and transformer decoder to generate multiple aesthetically pleasing crops with quality scores, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid image cropping methods lack explicit photographic composition guidance, which is crucial for visual appeal in applications like view recommendation and thumbnail generation. Evaluation-based methods lack globality while regression-based methods lack diversity.

Method: AesCrop integrates VMamba image encoder with novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and transformer decoder for end-to-end rank-based image cropping. MCAB explicitly encodes compositional cues into attention mechanism to focus on compositionally salient regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior quantitative metrics and producing qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Conclusion: AesCrop successfully bridges the gap between evaluation-based and regression-based approaches by incorporating explicit compositional guidance, delivering both diversity and globality in aesthetic image cropping.

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BoWG is a novel loop closure detection method that uses word groups to capture spatial co-occurrence of visual words and incorporates temporal consistency for improved precision-recall and computational efficiency in SLAM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional loop closure methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments like narrow pipes due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and repetitive textures, while existing solutions often have high computational costs.

Method: Introduces word groups to capture spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words for online dictionary construction, incorporates temporal consistency with adaptive scheme in similarity computation, and includes feature distribution analysis and post-verification mechanisms.

Result: BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in precision-recall and computational efficiency, achieving average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in Bicocca25b dataset, and shows excellent scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed BoWG method effectively addresses challenges in perceptually aliased environments, demonstrating superior performance in loop closure detection with high computational efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play super-resolution framework that uses spatially re-focused cross-attention and targeted classifier-free guidance to address semantic ambiguities and hallucinations in diffusion-based super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution methods suffer from semantic ambiguities due to inaccurate text conditioning and cross-attention diverting to irrelevant pixels, leading to semantic misalignment and hallucinated details.

Method: Proposes SRSR framework with two components: Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA) that refines text conditioning using visually-grounded segmentation masks, and Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free Guidance (STCFG) that selectively bypasses text influences on ungrounded pixels.

Result: Outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity metrics (PSNR and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and DISTS) on real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: SRSR effectively achieves both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in super-resolution by addressing semantic ambiguities and preventing hallucinations.

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' ability to understand subtle object state variations through three simultaneous tasks: object state identification, image retrieval, and state change identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While VLMs can perform various multimodal tasks, it's unclear how precisely they can identify subtle object states like positional states (open/closed) and functional states (on/off).

Method: Created a hand-crafted dataset with image pairs, object state descriptions, and state change descriptions. Introduced three simultaneous evaluation tasks: OSI, IR, and SCI. Also developed STATUS Train with 13M semi-automatically created descriptions for training.

Result: Current state-of-the-art VLMs significantly struggle with subtle object state distinctions. Most open-weight VLMs showed chance-level zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Conclusion: STATUS Bench and Train are necessary for advancing object state recognition in VLM research, as current models still struggle with capturing subtle state variations despite their general multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Motivation: Current micro-expression analysis struggles in real-world scenarios like natural conversations due to reliance on controlled lab datasets, requiring more robust solutions for wild environments.

Method: Proposed three contributions: conversational-in-the-wild micro-expression dataset, end-to-end MELDAE framework for localization and detection, and novel boundary-aware loss function to improve temporal accuracy by penalizing onset/offset errors.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on WDMD dataset with 17.72% improvement in F1_DR localization metric over strongest baseline, plus excellent generalization on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses micro-expression detection challenges in wild scenarios through novel dataset, architecture, and loss function, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in light field microscopy (LFM) for neural imaging by introducing a standardized dataset (XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark), a self-supervised learning method (MVN-LF) for angular priors, and a physics-based loss function (ORC Loss) for reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light field microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for neural imaging but faces challenges in 3D reconstruction due to lack of standardized datasets and methods that can efficiently model angular-spatial structure while remaining physically grounded.

Method: Three key contributions: 1) XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark dataset, 2) Masked View Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF) for self-supervised learning of angular priors, 3) Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss) as a differentiable rendering constraint.

Result: The proposed method achieves 7.7% improvement in PSNR over state-of-the-art baselines on the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset, self-supervised learning approach, and physics-based loss function significantly advance 3D reconstruction capabilities in light field microscopy for neuroscience applications.

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-view geo-localization methods rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, which increases inference costs and limits deployment on edge devices for real-time UAV applications.

Method: PFED combines hierarchical knowledge transfer and multi-view representation refinement. It uses Hierarchical Distillation (HD-CVGL) with Uncertainty-Aware Prediction Alignment during training, and an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module during inference to filter redundant samples.

Result: PFED achieves 97.15% Recall@1 on University-1652 dataset while being over 5x more efficient in FLOPs and 3x faster than previous methods. It runs at 251.5 FPS on AGX Orin edge device.

Conclusion: PFED demonstrates practical viability for real-time UAV applications by achieving superior accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3

TL;DR: PSScreen V2 is a partially supervised self-training framework for retinal disease screening that addresses label absence and domain shift using a three-branch architecture with novel feature augmentation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of previous methods that require fully labeled datasets or work with single domains, by learning from multiple partially labeled datasets with different distributions.

Method: Three-branch architecture with teacher-student networks: teacher generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented images, while students use LF-Dropout (discarding domain-related low-frequency components) and LF-Uncert (adversarially learned Gaussian perturbations of low-frequency statistics) for feature augmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization on multiple fundus datasets, with demonstrated compatibility across diverse backbones including DINOv2 and applicability to chest X-ray datasets.

Conclusion: PSScreen V2 provides an effective framework for partially supervised learning that addresses both label absence and domain shift challenges, showing strong generalization and adaptability across different medical imaging domains.

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

TL;DR: PEDB is a novel diffusion bridge model that incorporates data consistency for CT reconstruction from incomplete projection data, outperforming existing methods across sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data is challenging due to ill-posedness. While diffusion bridge models show promise, incorporating data consistency to align reconstructions with observed projection data remains underexplored but can improve fidelity and detail recovery.

Method: Proposes Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB) with a novel reverse SDE that samples clean images conditioned on both FBP reconstruction and incomplete projection data. Embeds projection data into the score function, derives tractable posterior score, introduces stochasticity control parameter, and designs discretization scheme to reduce errors.

Result: PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data (sparse-view, limited-angle, truncated projections). Outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations for all data types.

Conclusion: PEDB successfully incorporates data consistency into diffusion bridge models through explicit conditioning on projection data, demonstrating superior CT reconstruction performance across various incomplete data scenarios and evaluation settings.

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

### [109] [SWAN: Self-supervised Wavelet Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Unmixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22607)
*Yassh Ramchandani,Vijayashekhar S S,Jignesh S. Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN is a three-stage self-supervised wavelet neural network for hyperspectral unmixing that estimates endmembers and abundances without ground truth by leveraging wavelet transforms and physics-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a self-supervised method for hyperspectral unmixing that eliminates the need for ground truth data while exploiting latent symmetries from wavelet-based representations for robust feature extraction.

Method: Three-stage architecture: SWANencoder maps wavelet coefficients to latent space, SWANdecoder reconstructs coefficients, and SWANforward learns hyperspectral physics. Uses biorthogonal wavelet transforms, combined loss function, Adam optimization with dropout, and kernel regularizers.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark datasets show performance enhancement over state-of-the-art neural network methods, with qualitative, quantitative, and ablation results demonstrating resilient unmixing function learning.

Conclusion: SWAN successfully promotes self-supervision and compact network parameters for practical hyperspectral unmixing applications, achieving improved performance without requiring ground truth data.

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

*Mackenzie Tapp,Sibi Chakravarthy Parivendan,Kashfia Sailunaz,Suresh Neethirajan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose (trained on synthetic zebra imagery) for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows. While achieving promising performance on in-distribution data (AP=0.86), the model showed significant generalization failures when applied to unseen barns and cow populations, revealing limitations of synthetic-to-real transfer and morphological similarity for agricultural AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural applications of computer vision remain constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock, especially dairy cattle. The study aims to address this limitation through cross-species transfer learning.

Method: Adapted ZebraPose (a vision transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery) for 27-keypoint detection in dairy cows. Evaluated using three configurations: custom on-farm dataset (375 images), subset of APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination. Systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across different barn environments.

Result: The combined model achieved promising performance on in-distribution data (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87, PCK 0.5 = 0.869). However, substantial generalization failures occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations, exposing the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle.

Conclusion: Morphological similarity between species is insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study calls for agriculture-first AI design prioritizing farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

*Tharun Anand,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an analytical method to derive semantic editing directions directly from pretrained diffusion model parameters, eliminating need for additional data or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for finding interpretable editing directions in diffusion models rely on sampling large image sets or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.

Method: Uses eigenvectors of self-attention weight matrices from pretrained diffusion models to obtain interpretable editing directions, requiring no additional data or fine-tuning.

Result: Method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time by 60% compared to current benchmarks.

Conclusion: The analytical approach provides efficient and interpretable semantic editing directions directly from diffusion model parameters, significantly improving editing speed.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARCLIP is the first vision-language foundation model for SAR imagery, trained on a large-scale dataset of 1M text-image pairs using contrastive learning, enabling superior zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAR foundation models focus on low-level visual features but overlook multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition, limiting semantic understanding of SAR imagery.

Method: Constructed SARCLIP-1M dataset with 1M+ text-image pairs, then trained SARCLIP using contrastive vision-language learning with domain transfer strategy to bridge SAR imagery and text.

Result: Extensive experiments show SARCLIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models in image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification tasks.

Conclusion: SARCLIP advances semantic understanding of SAR imagery through effective multimodal alignment and demonstrates superior performance in feature extraction and interpretation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS effectively mitigates scale drift, enhances reconstruction robustness, and eliminates dynamic object influence through its novel hierarchical collaborative representation and joint dynamic modeling approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Alias-Free Vision Transformer that addresses the lack of translation invariance in standard ViTs by incorporating alias-free downsampling, nonlinearities, and linear cross-covariance attention to achieve shift-equivariant properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, making them less translation-invariant and more sensitive to minor image translations. While convnets also aren't perfectly shift-invariant due to aliasing, this work aims to improve ViT's translation robustness.

Method: Proposes Alias-Free ViT with two main components: alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities, and linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and fractional translations.

Result: The model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms similar-sized models in robustness to adversarial translations.

Conclusion: The proposed Alias-Free ViT successfully addresses translation invariance issues in Vision Transformers while maintaining competitive classification performance and improving robustness to adversarial translations.

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMap is a novel HD map construction method that addresses task misalignment issues in current approaches through three components: Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL) for better classification labels, Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA) for discriminative features, and Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS) to optimize DAFL usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HD map prediction methods perform poorly in high quality predictions due to inherent task misalignment caused by inappropriate task labels from one-to-many matching queries and sub-optimal task features from task-shared sampling mechanisms.

Method: DAMap consists of three key components: 1) Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL) to assign appropriate classification labels for one-to-many matching samples, 2) Task Modulated Deformable Attention (TMDA) to obtain discriminative task-specific features, and 3) Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS) to better utilize DAFL advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent performance improvement on NuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and training schedules.

Conclusion: DAMap effectively addresses the inherent defects in current HD map construction methods and achieves superior performance in predicting high-definition map elements with high classification and localization scores.

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key building metadata like construction year and structure type are often missing or outdated in Japan's second-hand housing market, making disaster risk assessment and insurance pricing difficult.

Method: Multi-task learning model that jointly estimates construction year, building structure, and property type from facade images, then derives fireproof classification (H/T/M) via rule-based mapping based on official insurance criteria.

Result: The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression and robust classification across imbalanced categories, capturing visual cues related to building age and materials.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based risk-profiling systems with applications in insurance, urban planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban

TL;DR: RoboSVG is a multimodal framework for generating interactive SVGs using text, visual, and numerical guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVGs are fundamental to digital design and robot control, encoding visual structure and motion paths, but current methods lack unified multimodal generation capabilities.

Method: A three-stage framework: produces multimodal guidance, synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated modules, and refines them under numerical guidance. Uses RoboDraw dataset of 1M SVG examples.

Result: Achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity across four tasks (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG, PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG), establishing new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: RoboSVG provides a versatile solution for interactive SVG generation with multimodal guidance, and the dataset will enable further research in this area.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

### [121] [VADTree: Explainable Training-Free Video Anomaly Detection via Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Tree](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22693)
*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree is a training-free video anomaly detection method that uses a hierarchical tree structure for flexible temporal sampling, leveraging pre-trained models for boundary detection and anomaly reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer video segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised VAD methods require extensive training data and lack explainability, while existing training-free methods with fixed temporal windows struggle to capture anomalies of varying durations effectively.

Method: VADTree constructs a Hierarchical Granularity-aware Tree (HGTree) using pre-trained GEBD model for event boundary detection, performs adaptive hierarchical structuring, and uses VLMs with multi-dimensional priors and LLMs for anomaly reasoning, followed by inter-cluster node correlation for score integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show VADTree achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while significantly reducing the number of sampled video segments.

Conclusion: VADTree provides an effective training-free solution for video anomaly detection that handles varying temporal spans through flexible hierarchical sampling and achieves superior performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Method: Proposes Windsock module for query-dependent retrieval decisions and modality selection, DANCE Instruction Tuning for adaptive training to enhance information utilization while maintaining noise robustness, and a self-assessment approach to convert QA datasets to MRAG training datasets.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly improves generation quality by 17.07% while reducing retrieval times by 8.95%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key challenges in MRAG by providing dynamic retrieval strategies and enhanced training methods, leading to substantial improvements in both response quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

*Vittorio Bernuzzi,Leonardo Rossi,Tomaso Fontanini,Massimo Bertozzi,Andrea Prati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE is a masked autoencoding framework for multispectral satellite imagery that uses Discrete Wavelet Transform for frequency-aware representation learning and Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding for geographical priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple remote sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning is needed for remote sensing due to limited annotated data. Current approaches lack scale-aware frequency representation and geographical context, which are crucial for satellite imagery analysis.

Method: WaveMAE uses multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform to disentangle frequency components and guide scale-aware high-frequency learning. It incorporates Geo-conditioned Positional Encoding with Spherical Harmonics to embed geographical priors. All models are pretrained on fMoW-S2 dataset.

Result: WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks. Even a lightweight variant with only 26.4% parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance across PANGAEA benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: WaveMAE establishes itself as a strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote sensing imagery, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-aware and geospatially conditioned self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

### [124] [IGGT: Instance-Grounded Geometry Transformer for Semantic 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22706)
*Hao Li,Zhengyu Zou,Fangfu Liu,Xuanyang Zhang,Fangzhou Hong,Yukang Cao,Yushi Lan,Manyuan Zhang,Gang Yu,Dingwen Zhang,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IGGT, an end-to-end transformer that unifies 3D geometric reconstruction and instance-level semantic understanding from 2D visual inputs using 3D-consistent contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches treat 3D geometry reconstruction and semantic understanding separately, limiting generalization and downstream task performance. Simple alignment of 3D models with language models restricts perception capacity and adaptability.

Method: IGGT uses 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning to encode unified representations with geometric structures and instance-grounded clustering from 2D visual inputs, enabling consistent lifting to coherent 3D scenes with distinct object instances.

Result: The method supports consistent lifting of 2D inputs into coherent 3D scenes with explicitly distinct object instances. The authors also created InsScene-15K dataset with RGB images, poses, depth maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations.

Conclusion: IGGT provides a unified approach for both spatial reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding, addressing the limitations of prior methods that treated these aspects in isolation.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

### [126] [Cross-view Localization and Synthesis - Datasets, Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22736)
*Ningli Xu,Rongjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cross-view visual understanding, focusing on two main tasks: cross-view localization (estimating geographic positions of ground-level images using overhead imagery) and cross-view synthesis (generating ground-level views from overhead imagery).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view visual understanding has gained significant attention due to its broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban planning, and augmented reality. The field has seen rapid progress driven by large-scale datasets and novel approaches, but faces challenges from significant perspective, resolution, and occlusion differences between overhead and ground-level imagery.

Method: The survey reviews widely used datasets and provides an organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Cross-view localization is typically formulated as an image retrieval problem using CNNs or ViTs for feature embedding, while cross-view synthesis employs GANs or diffusion models for image generation.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of advances in both cross-view localization and synthesis, highlighting key challenges and current limitations in the field.

Conclusion: The survey offers comparative analyses of existing methods and outlines promising directions for future research in cross-view visual understanding, providing a valuable resource for researchers through its organized project page.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

*Raihan Ahamed Rifat,Fuyad Hasan Bhoyan,Md Humaion Kabir Mehedi,Md Kaviul Hossain,Md. Jakir Hossen,M. F. Mridha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConMatFormer is a hybrid deep learning architecture combining ConvNeXt blocks, attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformer modules for accurate diabetic foot ulcer detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 97.55% accuracy and enhanced explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic foot ulcer detection faces challenges due to scarce and variable public datasets, requiring improved methods for accurate classification despite class imbalance and complex skin patterns.

Method: Proposed ConMatFormer hybrid architecture using ConvNeXt blocks for local features, multiple attention mechanisms (CBAM and DANet), and transformer modules for global context. Applied data augmentation to address class imbalance and used explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, LIME) for transparency.

Result: Achieved 89.61% accuracy and 91.60% precision in single experiments, and 97.55% accuracy with 0.0031 standard deviation in 4-fold cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN and ViT models on DFUC2021 and DFU datasets.

Conclusion: ConMatFormer sets a new benchmark for DFU classification and provides a reliable hybrid attention transformer framework for medical image analysis with enhanced accuracy, reliability, and explainability.

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCC (Self-Calibrated Consistency) is a test-time defense method that improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness against adversarial attacks by leveraging semantic and spatial consistency through pseudo-labels and multi-view predictions, without requiring labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment, and existing defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot settings.

Method: SCC consists of two modules: Semantic consistency uses soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment, while Spatial consistency aligns perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference.

Result: Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack settings show SCC consistently improves CLIP's zero-shot robustness while maintaining accuracy, and can be integrated with other VLMs for further gains.

Conclusion: SCC demonstrates the potential of establishing an adversarially robust paradigm for CLIP and broader vision-language domains, offering a plug-and-play inference strategy without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5

Motivation: Current audio-driven talking face generation methods struggle with temporal consistency, identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation, despite improvements in audio-lip synchronization.

Method: MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet for identity preservation and fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet for motion coherence using structured motion priors. It uses a progressive latent fusion strategy to improve long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.

Result: Extensive experiments show that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy.

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk offers a robust solution for talking face generation that maintains identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames, without requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve

MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve

### [131] [FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827)
*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge is a lightweight evaluation protocol that uses instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges to assess how well text-to-image systems match prompts and handle social attributes, addressing limitations of existing methods like CLIP and face classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image evaluation methods (face classifiers and contrastive similarity) reward surface cues, lack calibrated abstention, and miss weakly visible social attributes like religion, culture, and disability. There's a need for more accountable, evidence-aware evaluation of fairness in T2I systems.

Method: FairJudge treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges, using an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1], constraining judgments to closed label sets, requiring evidence grounded in visible content, and mandating abstention when cues are insufficient.

Result: Across multiple datasets (FairFace, PaTA, FairCoT, IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, DIVERSIFY-Professions), judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy.

Conclusion: FairJudge enables more reliable and reproducible fairness audits for text-to-image systems by providing accountable, evidence-aware decisions without requiring modifications to the image generators themselves.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting commercial memorability as part of the MediaEval 2025 competition, aiming to develop robust systems that can generalize well on test data.

Method: Proposes a multimodal fusion system with Gemma-3 LLM backbone that integrates pre-computed ViT visual features and E5 textual features via multi-modal projections, using LoRA for adaptation. Includes LLM-generated rationale prompts based on expert-derived memorability aspects.

Result: The LLM-based system demonstrates greater robustness and generalization performance on the final test set compared to the gradient boosted trees baseline ensemble.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal LLM fusion approach with rationale prompts effectively improves commercial memorability prediction, showing superior generalization capabilities over traditional ensemble methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: SP-CSVR effectively addresses the style trap problem in LVLMs, providing a robust framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style visual reasoning across diverse visual styles.

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual

### [134] [FastJAM: a Fast Joint Alignment Model for Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22842)
*Omri Hirsch,Ron Shapira Weber,Shira Ifergane,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM is a rapid graph-based method for joint image alignment that reduces computational complexity from hours/minutes to seconds while achieving better alignment quality than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint alignment approaches require long training times, large models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning, creating a need for more efficient methods.

Method: Leverages pairwise matches from off-the-shelf image matchers with rapid nonparametric clustering to build a graph of keypoint relations, then uses a graph neural network to propagate correspondences and predict homography parameters via image-level pooling with inverse-compositional loss.

Result: Achieves better alignment quality than existing modern JA methods while reducing computation time from hours/minutes to mere seconds on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: FastJAM provides an efficient and effective solution for joint image alignment that eliminates the need for regularization terms and associated hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code

### [135] [Semantic Surgery: Zero-Shot Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22851)
*Lexiang Xiong,Chengyu Liu,Jingwen Ye,Yan Liu,Yuecong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Surgery is a training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models that operates on text embeddings before diffusion, using calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize target concepts while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods often compromise generative quality, so there's a need for a training-free approach that can effectively remove harmful content while maintaining image quality.

Method: The framework dynamically estimates target concept presence in prompts and performs calibrated vector subtraction on text embeddings. It includes Co-Occurrence Encoding for multi-concept erasure and a visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence.

Result: Achieved 93.58 H-score in object erasure, reduced explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in style erasure with no quality degradation. Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in completeness and robustness.

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery provides a practical solution for safer text-to-image generation, functioning as a built-in threat detection system while preserving locality and image quality.

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

### [136] [Seeing the Unseen: Towards Zero-Shot Inspection for Wind Turbine Blades using Knowledge-Augmented Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22868)
*Yang Zhang,Qianyu Zhou,Farhad Imani,Jiong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot wind turbine blade inspection framework using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Vision-Language Models (VLM) to detect damage without requiring large labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments requiring timely damage detection, but current drone-based deep learning methods depend on large labeled datasets which limit detection of rare or evolving damage types.

Method: Constructs a multimodal knowledge base with technical documentation, reference images, and domain guidelines. Uses hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware reranking to assemble relevant context for VLM inference, enabling domain knowledge injection without task-specific training.

Result: On 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage categories, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, outperforming the same VLM without retrieval in both accuracy and precision. Framework showed strong explainability and generalizability for detecting previously unseen defects.

Conclusion: The research contributes a data-efficient industrial inspection solution that reduces dependence on extensive labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge through RAG-VLM integration.

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

*Huixuan Zhang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M³T2IBench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating text-to-image models on multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation scenarios, along with AlignScore metric that correlates well with human evaluation. It also proposes a training-free Revise-Then-Enforce approach to improve image-text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image alignment evaluations either address overly simple scenarios or use metrics that don't correlate well with human judgment, particularly failing on complex prompts with multiple instances of the same category.

Method: Developed M³T2IBench benchmark with multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation prompts and introduced AlignScore evaluation metric based on object detection. Proposed Revise-Then-Enforce training-free post-editing method to enhance alignment.

Result: Current open-source text-to-image models perform poorly on the challenging M³T2IBench benchmark. The Revise-Then-Enforce approach demonstrates improved image-text alignment across various diffusion models.

Conclusion: The study provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework for text-to-image alignment and offers an effective training-free solution to improve alignment in complex generation scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pasture biomass estimation is crucial for livestock production systems to optimize stocking rates, prevent overgrazing, and maintain system health through precision grazing management.

Method: Created a multidimensional dataset combining visual (top-view images), spectral (NDVI from Active Optical Sensors), and structural (vegetation height) information from 70cm × 30cm quadrats across multiple seasons and locations.

Result: A publicly available dataset of 1,162 annotated pasture images with corresponding ground truth measurements, released as a Kaggle competition to engage the machine learning community in pasture biomass estimation challenges.

Conclusion: The dataset enables new possibilities for advancing precision grazing management by providing comprehensive multidimensional data that combines visual, spectral, and structural information for improved pasture biomass estimation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated content detection benchmarks have limited coverage of diverse generative models and image categories, often missing end-to-end image editing and artistic images, creating gaps in authenticity verification.

Method: Developed UniAIDet benchmark covering text-to-image, image-to-image, image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models with both photographic and artistic images, then conducted comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods.

Result: The benchmark enables evaluation of detection methods' generalization capabilities and investigation of the relationship between detection and localization performance across diverse AI-generated content types.

Conclusion: UniAIDet provides a robust foundation for future research in AI-generated image detection by addressing coverage gaps in existing benchmarks and enabling comprehensive evaluation across diverse generative models and image types.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

### [140] [Gen-LangSplat: Generalized Language Gaussian Splatting with Pre-Trained Feature Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22930)
*Pranav Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat replaces scene-specific language autoencoders with a generalized autoencoder pre-trained on ScanNet, enabling efficient open-vocabulary 3D language field construction without per-scene training while maintaining comparable performance to LangSplat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like LangSplat require costly scene-specific autoencoder training for feature compression, creating a scalability bottleneck that hinders deployment of open-vocabulary 3D language fields.

Method: Uses a generalized autoencoder pre-trained on ScanNet dataset to compress CLIP features into a fixed latent space, eliminating the need for scene-specific training. Performs ablation studies to determine optimal latent dimensions and validate representational fidelity.

Result: Achieves efficiency boost in language field construction while delivering querying performance comparable to or exceeding original LangSplat. Validates embedding quality through MSE and cosine similarity metrics between original and reprojected CLIP embeddings.

Conclusion: Generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary querying in novel 3D scenes, enabling scalable real-time interactive 3D AI applications.

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

*Mouxiao Huang,Borui Jiang,Dehua Zheng,Hailin Hu,Kai Han,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPE (Positional Preservation Embedding) is a novel parameter-free encoding operator that preserves spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression in multimodal LLMs, improving performance by 2-5% across vision-language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by ignoring positional relationships, leading to inefficiencies in multimodal LLMs.

Method: PPE introduces disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, allowing compressed tokens to encapsulate different positions from multiple original tokens. It supports cascade clustering for progressive token compression and can be integrated into existing token merging methods without adjustments.

Result: Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves consistent improvements of 2-5% across multiple benchmarks: MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout understanding), and VideoMME (temporal understanding).

Conclusion: Preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM reasoning, and PPE provides a generic solution that maintains spatiotemporal structure during visual token compression.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

*Matthew So,Judah Goldfeder,Mark Lis,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that biometrics are statistically uncorrelated by testing fingerprint-to-fingerprint, iris-to-iris, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching using Bi-Encoder networks on 274 subjects with ~100k fingerprints and 7k iris images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the historic assumption that biometrics of an individual are statistically uncorrelated, particularly examining correlations between left and right irises and fingerprints.

Method: Used Bi-Encoder networks with ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones trained with contrastive loss on three verification tasks: fingerprint-to-fingerprint, iris-to-iris, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching.

Result: Iris ResNet achieved 91 ROC AUC for iris-to-iris matching, showing left and right irises are correlated. Fingerprint models confirmed positive intra-subject correlation. Cross-modal matching performed only slightly above chance.

Conclusion: The findings challenge biometric independence assumptions, with iris correlations clearly demonstrated. More data and sophisticated pipelines are needed for compelling cross-modal results. This is the first work using Vision Transformers for this matching task.

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

### [143] [Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization For Face Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22943)
*Yongbo Wang,Haonan Wang,Guodong Mu,Ruixin Zhang,Jiaqi Chen,Jingyun Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuan Xie,Zhizhong Zhang,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a switchable token-specific codebook quantization method for face image compression that learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns independent codebooks to each token, improving reconstruction performance especially at low bit rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing global codebook strategies for face image compression overlook category-specific correlations within images and semantic differences among tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance at low bit rates.

Method: Learns distinct codebook groups for different image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token, recording codebook group membership with minimal bits to enable larger total codebooks under lower overall bit rates.

Result: Achieved an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp on face recognition datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances expressive capability and reconstruction performance for face image compression, can be integrated into existing codebook-based approaches, and demonstrates effectiveness particularly at low bit rates.

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient approach to build competitive unified multimodal models by fusing existing specialized models through interleaved multimodal self-attention blocks, achieving strong performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current unified multimodal models require training from scratch with substantial computational resources, which is inefficient. The authors aim to show that competitive performance can be achieved more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available specialized models.

Method: The key design retains original model blocks while interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism enables rich multimodal fusion while preserving base model strengths, and combines high-level semantic representations from understanding encoders with low-level spatial signals from generation encoders.

Result: With only ~35B tokens of training, the approach achieves strong results: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that efficient fusion of existing specialized models can achieve competitive multimodal performance with significantly reduced computational requirements, and the authors release the full code, model weights, and datasets to support future research.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Zhidong Li,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAME is a fairness-aware video editing method that mitigates profession-related gender biases while maintaining prompt alignment and temporal consistency through attention modulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training-free video editing models tend to reinforce gender stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts, creating biased outputs that don't reflect real-world diversity.

Method: FAME uses fairness embeddings from minority representations by injecting debiasing tokens into the text encoder. It integrates fairness modulation into temporal self-attention (using region-constrained masks with time decay) and cross-attention (reweighting token-to-region matching with fairness-sensitive similarity masks).

Result: Extensive experiments on the FairVE benchmark show FAME achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity compared to existing video editing baselines, while preserving temporal consistency.

Conclusion: FAME effectively mitigates profession-related gender biases in video editing through attention modulation techniques that maintain both fairness and temporal coherence, outperforming current methods.

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

TL;DR: VALA is a variational alignment module that adaptively selects key frames and compresses latent features into semantic anchors for consistent training-free video editing, improving temporal consistency and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free video editing methods rely on heuristic frame selection for DDIM inversion, which introduces manual bias and reduces scalability of end-to-end inference.

Method: Proposes VALA - a variational alignment module with contrastive learning objective that adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into semantic anchors to preserve content and temporal coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments show VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing quality, and temporal consistency with improved efficiency over prior methods.

Conclusion: VALA can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing models and provides superior performance in maintaining temporal consistency while being more efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniScene, a unified framework for generating semantic occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds using the newly curated Nuplan-Occ dataset - the largest semantic occupancy dataset to date.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current occupancy-centric methods for driving scene generation depend heavily on annotated occupancy data, which remains scarce. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by creating a large-scale dataset and developing a unified generation framework.

Method: The approach uses a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture for 4D dynamic occupancy generation, with two novel techniques: Gaussian splatting-based sparse point map rendering for multi-view video generation, and sensor-aware embedding for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior generation fidelity and scalability compared to existing approaches, with practical validation in downstream autonomous driving tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed UniScene framework successfully addresses the data scarcity problem in occupancy-centric driving scene generation and demonstrates strong performance across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

### [149] [SceneDecorator: Towards Scene-Oriented Story Generation with Scene Planning and Scene Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22994)
*Quanjian Song,Donghao Zhou,Jingyu Lin,Fei Shen,Jiaze Wang,Xiaowei Hu,Cunjian Chen,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDecorator is a training-free framework for scene-oriented story generation that addresses scene planning and consistency challenges using VLM-guided planning and long-term attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with concept consistency, particularly in maintaining scene-level narrative coherence and long-term scene consistency across multiple stories, which limits their practical creativity in storytelling applications.

Method: Proposes SceneDecorator with two key components: VLM-Guided Scene Planning for narrative coherence in a global-to-local manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain scene consistency and subject diversity across stories.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of SceneDecorator compared to existing methods, showing improved scene consistency and narrative coherence.

Conclusion: SceneDecorator has significant potential to unleash creativity in arts, films, and games by effectively addressing scene-level consistency challenges in story generation.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [150] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix is a differentiable plug-and-play module that automatically learns optimal combinations of multi-scale logits in U-shaped networks through four fusion operators, improving segmentation performance without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current U-shaped network training treats multi-scale logits in isolation, missing the complementary cues from fusing coarse and fine predictions, which limits segmentation performance.

Method: LoMix mixes multi-scale decoder logits using four fusion operators (addition, multiplication, concatenation, attention-based fusion) and co-optimizes loss weights with network parameters through a NAS-inspired approach.

Result: On Synapse 8-organ dataset, LoMix improved DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, with advantages growing to +9.23% in data-scarce scenarios.

Conclusion: LoMix demonstrates that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly across benchmarks and networks while remaining data efficient, interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at

### [151] [CoMo: Compositional Motion Customization for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23007)
*Youcan Xu,Zhen Wang,Jiaxin Shi,Kexin Li,Feifei Shao,Jun Xiao,Yi Yang,Jun Yu,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo is a framework for compositional motion customization in text-to-video generation that enables synthesizing multiple distinct motions within a single video, addressing motion-appearance entanglement and multi-motion blending challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models struggle with precise motion control for complex multi-subject motions, and existing single-motion customization methods fail in compositional scenarios due to motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion blending.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Single-motion learning phase with static-dynamic decoupled tuning to disentangle motion from appearance and learn motion-specific modules; 2) Multi-motion composition phase with plug-and-play divide-and-merge strategy that spatially isolates motion influences during denoising without additional training.

Result: CoMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in controllable video generation, as demonstrated through extensive experiments. The framework also introduces a new benchmark and evaluation metric for multi-motion fidelity and blending assessment.

Conclusion: CoMo significantly advances the capabilities of controllable video generation by enabling effective compositional motion customization, addressing key challenges in multi-motion synthesis and providing a foundation for future research in this domain.

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

### [152] [UGAE: Unified Geometry and Attribute Enhancement for G-PCC Compressed Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23009)
*Pan Zhao,Hui Yuan,Chongzhen Tian,Tian Guo,Raouf Hamzaoui,Zhigeng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGAE is a unified framework for enhancing point cloud compression quality through three components: PoGE for geometry reconstruction, PAE for pre-attribute enhancement with geometry-guided recoloring, and PoAE for post-attribute enhancement with weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lossy compression of point clouds causes irreversible distortion in geometry and attributes, creating a need for enhancement methods to improve quality while maintaining compression efficiency.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) PoGE uses Transformer-based sparse convolutional U-Net for geometry reconstruction; 2) PAE employs geometry-guided recoloring with DA-KNN to preserve details before compression; 3) PoAE uses attribute residual prediction with W-MSE loss for frequency-aware enhancement.

Result: Significantly outperformed existing methods on 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB datasets. Achieved 9.98 dB BD-PSNR gain and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings for geometry, plus 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes compared to G-PCC TMC13v29.

Conclusion: UGAE framework effectively enhances both geometry and attribute quality in compressed point clouds, achieving substantial performance gains in both objective metrics and perceptual quality across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

*Hongyu Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhangkai Wu,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NestAR is a nested autoregressive model that uses hierarchical multi-scale modules to reduce computational complexity from O(n) to O(log n) for generating n image tokens while improving sample diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive models for image generation are computationally intensive and often suffer from limited sample diversity, despite achieving competitive performance compared to diffusion models.

Method: NestAR proposes a nested autoregressive architecture with hierarchical multi-scale modules, where larger-scale modules are conditioned on outputs from smaller-scale modules. Each module uses AR structure to generate patches of tokens, incorporates flow matching loss for continuous tokens, and uses coordination objectives for multi-scale training.

Result: NestAR achieves competitive image generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost compared to standard autoregressive models.

Conclusion: The nested autoregressive architecture with hierarchical multi-scale modules effectively reduces computational complexity and improves sample diversity in image generation tasks.

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba is a hierarchical architecture for video temporal grounding that preserves temporal structure across scales using Anchor-MambaPooling blocks and contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for video temporal grounding struggle with long videos, often compromising temporal fidelity through over-downsampling or fixed windows, making it difficult to capture both global context and fine-grained temporal details.

Method: Uses hierarchical architecture with Anchor-MambaPooling blocks that leverage Mamba's selective scanning to create compact anchor tokens at multiple granularities, combined with anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive losses.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art performance on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and TACoS benchmarks, demonstrating precise and temporally faithful localization in long, untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: HieraMamba effectively addresses the challenges of video temporal grounding in long videos by preserving temporal structure across scales while maintaining semantic richness, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple method using MIND feature space transformation and ensembling to improve robustness of deep learning brain registration across different imaging contrasts and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning registration methods often fail to generalize beyond their training data distribution, limiting their practical usability in clinical settings with diverse imaging modalities.

Method: Transform input images into MIND feature space before feeding to registration model, combined with a special ensembling strategy for improved performance.

Result: The approach significantly improves registration robustness when applied to imaging contrasts and modalities different from the training set.

Conclusion: Simple feature space transformation and ensembling can substantially enhance the generalization capability of deep learning registration methods across diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for
significantly improving robustness by transforming the images into MIND feature
space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoWave is a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian Splatting framework for 3D reconstruction in endoscopic surgery that addresses photometric inconsistencies and tissue motion through optical flow-based geometric constraints and multi-resolution wavelet supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoscopic surgery presents unique challenges like photometric inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights that mislead traditional 3DGS-based methods relying solely on appearance constraints, leading to inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: EndoWave uses a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation in 4D domain, incorporates optical flow-based geometric constraints for temporal coherence, and employs multi-resolution rational orthogonal wavelet supervision to separate endoscopic details and enhance rendering.

Result: Extensive evaluations on EndoNeRF and StereoMIS datasets show that EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed EndoWave framework effectively addresses endoscopic reconstruction challenges through unified spatio-temporal modeling, geometric constraints, and wavelet supervision, demonstrating superior performance in surgical 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes multimodal Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and proposes two variants (MHRoPE and MRoPE-I) that outperform existing methods in multimodal understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position encoding despite its importance for vision-language models.

Method: The authors conduct comprehensive analysis of multimodal RoPE's core components (position design and frequency allocation) and propose two plug-and-play variants: Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I) that require no architectural changes.

Result: The proposed methods consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: Three key guidelines for effective multimodal position encoding are identified: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation of textual priors. The proposed MHRoPE and MRoPE-I variants effectively implement these principles.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods

*Hebaixu Wang,Jing Zhang,Haoyang Chen,Haonan Guo,Di Wang,Jiayi Ma,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RDBM proposes a unified diffusion bridge model that uses residuals to adaptively restore degraded image regions while preserving intact areas, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various image restoration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion bridge models lack unified analytical perspective and indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection, which distorts undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction.

Method: Theoretically reformulate stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge, derive analytical formulas for forward/reverse processes, and leverage residuals from given distributions to modulate noise injection/removal for adaptive restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

Conclusion: RDBM provides a unified framework where existing bridge models are special cases, with empirical demonstration of optimality and superior restoration performance.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Conclusion: The proposed task-agnostic pretraining framework provides effective multimodal fusion with strong cross-modal generation capabilities and robust downstream performance across various tasks.

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream

pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSalt is a deep learning framework that transfers high-resolution spectral knowledge from lab spectroscopy to satellite hyperspectral imagery for large-scale soil salinity monitoring without extensive ground sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil salinization threatens ecosystems and agriculture by limiting plant water absorption and reducing crop productivity. Current methods face limitations: lab spectroscopy lacks scalability while satellite imagery lacks fine-grained interpretability.

Method: DeepSalt uses knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to satellite-based hyperspectral sensing, enabling domain adaptation without extensive ground sampling.

Result: DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit domain adaptation, effectively generalizes to unseen geographic regions, and explains a substantial portion of salinity variance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between lab precision and satellite scalability, enabling accurate large-scale soil salinity estimation through effective spectral knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

### [161] [Note on the Construction of Structure Tensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23137)
*Josef Bigun,Fernado Alonso-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reconciles two different structure tensor constructions by viewing them through the common lens of Total Least Squares line fitting to the power spectrum, showing that the correction term in the 1995 approach is unnecessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically reconcile two seemingly different structure tensor constructions from 1987 and 1995 by finding their common mathematical foundation.

Method: Analyzes both structure tensor approaches through the common framework of Total Least Squares line fitting to the power spectrum, eliminating the correction term from the 1995 method.

Result: The reconciliation shows that omitting the correction term ensures positive semi-definite tensors, simplifies eigenvalue interpretation, allows fitting multiple orientations, and removes constraints on filter types and tessellations.

Conclusion: Both structure tensor constructions can be unified under TLS line fitting, providing a more flexible framework that accommodates various filter types and tessellations while maintaining mathematical rigor.

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

### [163] [DQ3D: Depth-guided Query for Transformer-Based 3D Object Detection in Traffic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23144)
*Ziyu Wang,Wenhao Li,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DQ3D is a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection that uses depth information and 2D detections to sample reference points from object surfaces/interiors, with hybrid attention to handle occlusions by fusing historical detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection methods using reference points often sample points far from target objects, leading to false positives. The paper addresses this limitation by ensuring reference points come from object surfaces/interiors.

Method: Proposes depth-guided query generator using depth information and 2D detections, plus hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results with depth-guided queries to handle occluded objects.

Result: Outperforms baseline by 6.3% in mAP and 4.3% in NDS on nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Depth-guided query generation with hybrid attention effectively improves 3D object detection accuracy by ensuring proper reference point sampling and handling object occlusions.

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ITM is a novel framework that implicitly models pre-trained models' intrinsic transferability using a Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation strategy, enabling accurate transferability estimation across diverse model architectures and downstream tasks without full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transferability estimation methods struggle to accurately assess emerging pre-trained models with diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments, limiting their practical deployment in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm.

Method: Proposes Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM) framework that implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently approximate embedding space evolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on comprehensive benchmarks show ITM consistently outperforms existing methods in stability, effectiveness, and efficiency across various training regimes and model types.

Conclusion: ITM enables generalization across broader range of models and downstream tasks, advancing transferability estimation capabilities for diverse pre-trained models.

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

*Sixian Liu,Chen Xu,Qiang Wang,Donghai Shi,Yiwen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-Fusion is a multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion method that uses adaptive gated fusion with cross-modal attention to selectively integrate reliable features, achieving robust 3D object detection in challenging scenarios with sensor degradation or environmental disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion methods show significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios with sensor degradation or environmental disturbances, limiting their practical application in complex real-world environments.

Method: The approach projects features from each modality into unified BEV space, enhances them with window-based attention, and uses an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention to selectively integrate reliable features into robust BEV representations.

Result: Achieves 93.92% accuracy on KITTI dataset and outperforms baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in complex industrial scenes.

Conclusion: AG-Fusion provides a robust solution for 3D object detection in challenging environments by adaptively selecting reliable cross-modal patterns, with significant performance improvements demonstrated on both standard and challenging datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

### [166] [Finding 3D Scene Analogies with Multimodal Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23184)
*Junho Kim,Young Min Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a zero-shot, open-vocabulary method for finding 3D scene analogies using multimodal foundation models, enabling trajectory and waypoint transfer across different 3D environments without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to adapt and plan in new 3D environments by connecting current observations with prior experiences through scene analogies, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.

Method: Uses a hybrid neural representation combining a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field from 3D shape foundation models. Scene analogies are found through coarse-to-fine alignment: first aligning the graph, then refining correspondences with feature fields.

Result: The method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes and successfully enables applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer across different 3D environments.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates effective zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D scene analogy finding using multimodal foundation models, providing a practical solution for robot adaptation and planning in unseen environments.

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

### [167] [Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190)
*Pascal Benschop,Cristian Meo,Justin Dauwels,Jelte P. Mense*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using vision-language models (VLMs) as zero-shot anomaly detectors in video by converting video to text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. The study evaluates VLMs on anomaly detection tasks and identifies their strengths in simple spatial events and weaknesses with noisy cues and privacy filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The overwhelming amount of video data from widespread camera use creates a critical challenge for public safety and security, as timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial but exceeds human monitoring capacity. The paper aims to address the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video.

Method: The paper frames anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task using pre-trained vision-language models. It converts video into text descriptions and scores labels via textual entailment. The approach is evaluated on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets under various prompting and privacy-preserving conditions.

Result: Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models but may increase false positives. Privacy filters, especially full-body GAN transforms, introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. Current VLMs succeed with simple, spatially salient events but falter with noisy spatial cues and identity obfuscation.

Conclusion: The paper outlines paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training, including structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding.

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

*Lukas Bierling,Davide Pasero,Fleur Dolmans,Helia Ghasemi,Angelo Broere*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO improves upon DECO for human-object contact prediction by using dual DINOv2 encoders, class-balanced loss, and patch-level cross-attention to address limitations with soft surfaces, occlusions, and false positives, achieving significant performance gains on the DAMON benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction is crucial for human-object interaction models in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO had limitations with binary contact maps, soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot contacts.

Method: Three-branch network based on DECO's framework using two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders, class-balanced loss weighting, patch-level cross-attention for local reasoning, and lightweight MLP with softmax for semantic contact labels.

Result: On DAMON benchmark: 7% increase in binary-contact F1 score, halved geodesic error, added object-level semantic labels. Outperformed challenge baseline in both DAMON Challenge tasks.

Conclusion: DecoDINO successfully addresses DECO's limitations through dual encoders and LoRA fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human-object contact prediction with improved accuracy and semantic labeling capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

*Hoonhee Cho,Jae-Young Kang,Giwon Lee,Hyemin Yang,Heejun Park,Seokwoo Jung,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VR-Drive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction as an auxiliary task, enabling planning-aware view synthesis without additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints remains an open problem in end-to-end autonomous driving, as diverse vehicle configurations create real-world challenges with different camera perspectives.

Method: VR-Drive uses feed-forward inference for online training-time augmentation from sparse views, introduces a viewpoint-mixed memory bank for temporal interaction across viewpoints, and employs viewpoint-consistent distillation to transfer knowledge from original to synthesized views.

Result: VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and improves planning under viewpoint shifts, demonstrating scalability and robustness for real-world deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: The proposed VR-Drive framework provides a scalable and robust solution for viewpoint generalization in end-to-end autonomous driving, with the release of a new benchmark dataset for comprehensive evaluation under novel camera viewpoints.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathSearch is a novel framework for whole slide image retrieval that combines fine-grained mosaic representations with global slide embeddings using vision-language contrastive learning, enabling accurate image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval in digital pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The digitization of histopathology slides creates opportunities for computational tools, but effective retrieval of gigapixel whole slide images remains challenging due to scale issues and difficulty capturing subtle semantic differences amid irrelevant content.

Method: Unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning, trained on 6,926 slide-report pairs. Supports mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval and multi-modal text-to-slide retrieval.

Result: Outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks on four public datasets and three in-house cohorts. Multi-center reader study shows improved diagnostic accuracy, boosted confidence, and enhanced inter-observer agreement among pathologists in clinical scenarios.

Conclusion: PathSearch establishes a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology that captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns for accurate and flexible slide retrieval.

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

*Razaib Tariq,Minji Heo,Simon S. Woo,Shahroz Tariq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deepfake detectors perform poorly on Moiré-affected videos, with performance drops up to 25.4%. Synthetic Moiré patterns cause 21.4% accuracy reduction, and demoiréing methods worsen performance by 17.2%. The study introduces DeepMoiréFake dataset to address this real-world challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detection faces challenges in real-world settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens introduces Moiré artifacts that distort detection outcomes, an issue that has received little attention.

Method: Systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art deepfake detectors on Moiré-affected videos using a dataset of 12,832 videos (35.64 hours) from multiple datasets, plus additional experiments with DeepMoiréFake dataset and synthetic Moiré generation techniques.

Result: Moiré artifacts degrade detector performance by up to 25.4%, synthetic Moiré patterns cause 21.4% accuracy drop, and demoiréing methods unexpectedly worsen performance by up to 17.2%.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for detection models that robustly handle Moiré distortions alongside other real-world challenges. The DMF dataset aims to drive research toward closing the gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eruku is a new approach for Handwritten Text Generation that frames the task as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation, using special textual tokens and Classifier-Free Guidance to improve content controllability and reduce input requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive Transformer methods for HTG require additional inputs, lack proper stop mechanisms, can get stuck in repetition loops, and generate visual artifacts. There's a need for better content controllability and fewer input requirements.

Method: Framed HTG as multimodal prompt-conditioned generation, introduced special textual input tokens for better alignment with visual tokens, and devised a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for the autoregressive model.

Result: Compared to previous solutions, Eruku requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows textual prompts more faithfully with improved content adherence.

Conclusion: The proposed Eruku approach successfully addresses content controllability issues in HTG by rethinking the autoregressive formulation and introducing better alignment between textual and visual tokens, resulting in more faithful and controllable text generation.

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive Growing of Patch Size is a curriculum learning method for 3D medical image segmentation that gradually increases patch size during training, improving class balance and accelerating convergence while maintaining or boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address class imbalance issues in 3D medical image segmentation and accelerate training convergence by implementing an automatic curriculum learning approach that progressively increases patch size.

Method: A curriculum learning approach that progressively increases the patch size during model training, evaluated in two modes: resource-efficient (reduces training time) and performance (improves segmentation accuracy).

Result: Resource-efficient mode reduced training time to 44% while matching baseline Dice scores. Performance mode achieved 1.28% relative mean Dice score improvement and reduced training time to 89%, with benefits most pronounced for imbalanced tasks like lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The progressive patch size curriculum is a simple yet effective strategy that improves both segmentation performance and training efficiency across diverse architectures (UNet, UNETR, SwinUNETR), reduces performance variance, and is broadly applicable to 3D medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

*Sam Pollard,Michael Wray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method using Shapley values to analyze feature attributions and modality scores in vision-language models for video question answering, revealing text dominance and the importance of ignoring distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As VLMs become more prevalent for answering questions about the world, there's concern about text dominance and underdeveloped modality interactions. The paper aims to measure whether multi-modal models are developing properly given their complexity.

Method: The authors propose computing feature attributions and modality scores using Shapley values, treating video frames and textual elements as equal features. They analyze 6 VLM models with varying context lengths on 4 multiple-choice VQA datasets, considering video, question, and answer as three interacting modalities.

Result: Results show a dependence on text and demonstrate that multiple-choice VQA tasks essentially become tests of a model's ability to ignore distractors rather than true multi-modal understanding.

Conclusion: Current VLM models exhibit text dominance in VQA tasks, and the multiple-choice format may not adequately measure true multi-modal reasoning capabilities, instead rewarding models that are good at filtering out irrelevant information.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical image detection and classification model based on YOLO, addressing limitations of conventional flat classification by incorporating object hierarchy relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN classification methods focus on flat classification, ignoring the natural hierarchical organization of real-world objects. Capturing hierarchical relations enables better contextual understanding and control over mistake severity.

Method: Developed an end-to-end hierarchical model based on YOLO with novel hierarchical architecture, modified loss function, and hierarchical performance metrics. Evaluated on two hierarchical categorizations of the same dataset.

Result: The proposed methodology successfully addresses the inherent hierarchical structure in real-world objects that conventional flat classification algorithms overlook.

Conclusion: Hierarchical classification models provide better contextual understanding and error control compared to flat classification by capturing natural object hierarchies present in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

*Ruoyu Wang,Beier Zhu,Junzhi Li,Liangyu Yuan,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaSDE is a novel single-step SDE solver that dynamically balances ODE efficiency with SDE error resilience using a learnable coefficient, achieving state-of-the-art performance in diffusion sampling with minimal function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based generative processes face a trade-off between computational speed and sample quality - ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient errors while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors with limited step budgets.

Method: Introduces AdaSDE, a single-step SDE solver with a per-step learnable coefficient estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling. Can be integrated with existing solvers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, FID scores of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom.

Conclusion: AdaSDE successfully unifies ODE efficiency with SDE error resilience, providing a practical solution for fast and high-quality diffusion sampling that can enhance existing solver frameworks.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

*Haochen Zhao,Yuyao Kong,Yongxiu Xu,Gaopeng Gou,Hongbo Xu,Yubin Wang,Haoliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMSD3.0, a multi-image sarcasm detection benchmark, and proposes CIRM model with cross-image reasoning and fine-grained fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sarcasm detection methods focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking multi-image semantic relations in real-world settings where sarcasm can be triggered by multiple images.

Method: Proposed Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM) with targeted cross-image sequence modeling and relevance-guided fine-grained cross-modal fusion based on text-image correspondence.

Result: MMSD3.0 is validated as an effective benchmark reflecting real-world conditions, and CIRM achieves state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0 and MMSD3.0 datasets.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in multi-image sarcasm detection and demonstrates CIRM's effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image scenarios.

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

*Yingying Feng,Jie Li,Jie Hu,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID is a flexible any-to-any image-level ReID framework that handles both modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios by decomposing modality features into shared and specific components, achieving significant performance improvements on multi-modality benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ReID systems face modality inconsistencies where query and gallery images come from different sensors (RGB, NIR, TIR), but most existing methods assume modality-matched conditions, limiting their practical robustness and scalability.

Method: MDReID introduces Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) to explicitly decompose modality features into modality-shared and modality-specific representations, and Modality-aware Metric Learning (MML) to enforce orthogonality and complementarity between these components.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multi-modality benchmarks show MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements: 9.8%, 3.0%, and 11.5% in modality-matched scenarios, and average gains of 3.4%, 11.8%, and 10.9% in modality-mismatched scenarios.

Conclusion: MDReID effectively addresses modality inconsistency challenges in real-world ReID systems by decomposing modality features and leveraging both shared and specific representations, demonstrating superior performance across various modality conditions.

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReconViaGen integrates reconstruction priors into diffusion-based 3D generative methods to address incompleteness in multi-view 3D reconstruction, achieving complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view 3D reconstruction methods suffer from incompleteness due to occlusions and sparse coverage, while diffusion-based 3D generative methods offer potential but lack consistency and reliability.

Method: Proposes ReconViaGen that integrates reconstruction priors into generative framework, addressing insufficiency in cross-view connections and poor controllability of iterative denoising during detail generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReconViaGen can reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both global structure and local details.

Conclusion: ReconViaGen successfully bridges the gap between reconstruction and generation, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from sparse multi-view inputs by leveraging generative priors while maintaining consistency.

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Motivation: Medical image analysis is crucial for drug discovery and preclinical evaluation, but current full-image models struggle with subtle dose differences in paclitaxel exposure classification from phase-contrast microscopy of C6 glioma cells.

Method: Proposed a simple tiling-and-aggregation pipeline that processes local patches and combines tile outputs into an image label, with additional interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM and Score-CAM.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark dataset, improving over published baseline by approximately 20 percentage points, with trends confirmed by cross-validation.

improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and

### [182] [PlanarTrack: A high-quality and challenging benchmark for large-scale planar object tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23368)
*Yifan Jiao,Xinran Liu,Xiaoqiong Liu,Xiaohui Yuan,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarTrack is a large-scale benchmark for planar tracking with 1,150 sequences and 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 long-term videos recorded in unconstrained conditions. It features high-quality manual annotations and unique targets per sequence, making it the largest and most diverse planar tracking dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of planar tracking in the deep learning era is limited by the lack of large-scale platforms. Existing benchmarks are insufficient for comprehensive evaluation of tracking methods in realistic conditions.

Method: Created PlanarTrack benchmark with 1,150 sequences (1,000 short-term + 150 long-term) totaling 733K frames. Videos were recorded in unconstrained wild conditions, each frame manually annotated with four corner points through multi-round inspection. Each sequence contains a unique target to enhance diversity.

Result: PlanarTrack is the largest and most diverse planar tracking dataset. Evaluation of 10 representative trackers showed significant performance degradation on this challenging benchmark, indicating current methods are insufficient for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PlanarTrack provides a comprehensive benchmark that reveals the limitations of current planar tracking methods. More research effort is needed to improve planar tracking performance for real-world applications in robotics and augmented reality.

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSSR is an efficient super-resolution framework for remote sensing that uses frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion with cross-modal attention, auxiliary knowledge integration, and specialized losses to achieve state-of-the-art performance while maintaining fast inference speeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current remote sensing super-resolution methods including expensive training requirements, slow inference, limited use of auxiliary information as real-world constraints, and lack of downstream task evaluation.

Method: Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, integrates cross-modal attention with auxiliary knowledge (DEM, land cover, month) and SAR guidance, enhanced by adapters and Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity.

Result: Achieved PSNR/SSIM of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), lowest NDVI MSE (0.042), efficient inference (0.39 sec/image), and superior crop classification (F1: 0.86) compared to Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85).

Conclusion: LSSR demonstrates the potential of remote sensing super-resolution to advance precision agriculture through efficient, high-quality image reconstruction with reliable downstream task performance.

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1 is a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that addresses challenges in video temporal grounding by filtering partially annotated samples and dynamically adjusting training difficulty for hard-to-ground samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for video temporal grounding overlook issues with training sample quality and difficulty, specifically partially annotated samples that introduce ambiguous supervision and hard-to-ground samples that produce indistinguishable rewards during RL training.

Method: Proposes a Boundary Reflection Agent to identify and filter partially annotated samples by predicting query-relevant timestamps outside annotated intervals, and a Difficulty Estimation Agent with curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks videos of hard-to-ground samples based on training steps.

Result: VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts with only 10% of training samples and 21% of computational budget on VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks, achieving better performance under both GRPO and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations enables data-efficient training by addressing sample quality and difficulty challenges, demonstrating significant improvements in video temporal grounding performance with reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at

accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the
experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud learning faces limitations due to scarce large-scale datasets, unlike image/text domains with abundant data.

Method: Create a formula-driven dataset using symmetry concepts to generate shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural networks to learn point cloud features effectively.

Result: The dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream classification and segmentation tasks with good few-shot learning capabilities.

Conclusion: Symmetria provides a scalable, publicly available dataset that promotes data-efficient experimentation and enables broad generalization across geometric settings, supporting further research in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision

It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces

Conclusion: FRBNet effectively enhances illumination-invariant features through frequency-domain analysis and can be seamlessly integrated into existing networks for improved low-light vision performance.

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

### [189] [Quality-controlled registration of urban MLS point clouds reducing drift effects by adaptive fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23416)
*Marco Antonio Ortiz Rincon,Yihui Yang,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel workflow for efficient registration of mobile laser scanning point clouds to target models in urban environments, featuring SSC preprocessing and PV-GICP fine registration to handle density variations, noise, and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in urban point cloud registration including varying density, noise characteristics, and occlusion scenarios common in city centers, while improving accuracy and reducing computation time.

Method: Two key innovations: 1) Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing that fragments MLS trajectory data using orthogonal planar surfaces to reduce drift impact; 2) Planar Voxel-based Generalized Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP) for fine registration that selectively uses planar surfaces within voxel partitions.

Result: Achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy with over 50% reduction in computation time compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods, demonstrated on real-world datasets from Munich's inner city.

Conclusion: The proposed workflow significantly advances automated 3D urban modeling with applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic city monitoring through improved accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

*Ahmet Serdar Karadeniz,Dimitrios Mallis,Danila Rukhovich,Kseniya Cherenkova,Anis Kacem,Djamila Aouada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel CAD reverse engineering approach using multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns, capturing fine parametric details and incorporating sketch constraints for reconstructing detailed, editable CAD models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for CAD reverse engineering either fail to produce fully parametric outputs (bottom-up approaches) or overlook fine-grained geometric details (top-down approaches), and none incorporate essential sketch-level constraints.

Method: The approach uses multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns, inspired by how human designers manually perform CAD reverse engineering, enabling more effective capture of fine parametric details.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and successfully reconstructs detailed and editable CAD models while incorporating sketch constraints for the first time.

Conclusion: This novel approach addresses key limitations in current CAD reverse engineering methods by combining effective parametric detail capture with sketch constraint integration, resulting in superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

### [191] [On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23482)
*Zujing Liu,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Yuan Gao,Guisong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a faithfulness problem in multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) reasoning where visual information is often inaccurate but still leads to correct answers. The authors propose a novel Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning strategy to improve visual faithfulness in MCoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models generate multimodal chain-of-thought traces that incorporate visual information, but this visual information is often inaccurate while still yielding correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the reasoning process. This unfaithfulness stems from RL rewards that only incentivize the format of interleaved vision-text cues without considering visual correctness.

Method: The authors first probe MCoT faithfulness through intervention experiments, then introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric to quantify visual cue faithfulness from reliability and sufficiency perspectives. They propose Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning, which encourages MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that independently lead to correct answers. SCCM is annotation-free and plug-and-play compatible with various reinforcement fine-tuning methods.

Result: Intervention experiments show that model predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating visual evidence is largely ignored. Evaluation reveals visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves visual faithfulness across fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed SCCM learning strategy effectively addresses the visual faithfulness problem in multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning by ensuring visual components are both sufficient and minimal, leading to more reliable and interpretable reasoning processes in vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

TL;DR: Video-Thinker extends dynamic reasoning to videos by enabling MLLMs to autonomously use grounding and captioning capabilities for video reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image reasoning methods like "Thinking with Images" haven't been extended to video reasoning tasks, creating a gap in dynamic reasoning capabilities for multimodal models.

Method: Constructed Video-Thinker-10K dataset with autonomous tool usage in chain-of-thought reasoning, trained via SFT for reasoning format and GRPO to strengthen reasoning capability, enabling autonomous grounding and captioning without external tools.

Result: Video-Thinker-7B achieves significant performance gains on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, VRBench), substantially outperforming baselines like Video-R1 and establishing SOTA among 7B-sized MLLMs.

Conclusion: Video-Thinker successfully extends dynamic reasoning to videos by enabling MLLMs to autonomously leverage their intrinsic capabilities, eliminating the need for external tools while achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

*Karthikeyan Chandra Sekaran,Markus Geisler,Dominik Rößle,Adithya Mohan,Daniel Cremers,Wolfgang Utschick,Michael Botsch,Werner Huber,Torsten Schön*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X is the first large-scale multi-modal dataset for cooperative perception with vehicles and infrastructure across three urban intersections, addressing limitations of existing datasets that are limited to single intersections or vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cooperative perception datasets are limited to single intersections or single vehicles, causing overfitting and misleading performance due to similar layouts and behaviors. A comprehensive multi-intersection dataset with multiple vehicles and infrastructure sensors is needed for diverse traffic environment benchmarking.

Method: Created UrbanIng-V2X dataset with 34 temporally aligned and spatially calibrated sensor sequences from three intersections in Ingolstadt, Germany. Each sequence includes data from two vehicles and up to three infrastructure sensor poles, featuring RGB cameras, LiDARs, and thermal cameras.

Result: The dataset contains 12 vehicle-mounted RGB cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12 infrastructure LiDARs, with approximately 712k annotated 3D bounding boxes across 13 object classes at 10 Hz frequency.

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X enables comprehensive benchmarking of cooperative perception algorithms across diverse urban environments and provides codebase, dataset, HD map, and digital twin for research community use.

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

*Xin Jin,Siyuan Li,Siyong Jian,Kai Yu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix is a training-time augmentation method that bridges supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for vision-language alignment in multi-modal LLMs. It uses attention-aware image mixing and preference-driven training to improve alignment quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for vision-language alignment face trade-offs: SFT requires large human annotations and misses subtle preferences, while RL has overhead and instability issues. There's a need for a scalable, robust approach that maintains alignment quality.

Method: MergeMix applies attention-aware image mixing via token merge with cluster representation and spatial context, then builds preference pairs with mixed and raw images, optimizing via SimPO loss. This enhances attention consistency and efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with improved efficiency, surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification tasks.

Conclusion: MergeMix provides a scalable approach to preference alignment in classification and MLLMs, effectively bridging the gap between SFT and RL methods while maintaining efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOLD is a framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from text-only teacher models to vision-language student models using reinforcement learning with on-policy distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision-language models for complex reasoning is challenging due to scarce high-quality image-text reasoning data, while text-based reasoning resources are abundant but underutilized for VLM reasoning.

Method: VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with on-policy distillation, allowing student reasoning traces to be guided by teacher models, plus cold-start alignment via supervised fine-tuning for effective transfer.

Result: VOLD significantly outperforms baseline models and improves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and LogicVista.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transfers reasoning capabilities from text-only teachers to VLMs, with cold-start alignment being essential for effective on-policy distillation and meaningful guidance from text-only teachers.

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Conclusion: iPac provides a versatile and generic solution for medical image classification by effectively leveraging graph representations that account for inherent structure and relationships among visual entities.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse is a training-free method for multi-subject text-to-image generation that automatically fuses multiple subject LoRAs using dynamic masks derived from cross-attention weights, eliminating the need for additional training, model modifications, or user specifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-subject generation either require pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex techniques like noise blending, which are inefficient and impractical for seamless integration into standard workflows.

Method: The approach automatically derives context-aware dynamic subject masks from cross-attention layer weights and applies these masks directly to LoRA outputs during inference, approximating individual LoRA usage for specific regions without modifying the LoRAs themselves.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both generation quality and usability for multi-subject generation tasks, demonstrating superior practicality and efficiency.

Conclusion: FreeFuse provides a highly practical and efficient solution for multi-subject text-to-image generation that requires no additional training, no LoRA modifications, no auxiliary models, and minimal user input, while achieving better performance than existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LiDAR point cloud annotation is costly, and existing self-training UDA methods don't effectively use unlabeled data due to fixed confidence thresholds, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Dynamic Pseudo-Label Filtering scheme for better real data utilization, Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline to reduce domain shift, and data mixing consistency loss for context-free representations.

Result: Achieves superior performance on two synthetic-to-real point cloud semantic segmentation tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of proposed modules.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations in existing point cloud UDA methods and demonstrates improved performance through better data utilization and domain adaptation techniques.

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

TL;DR: EgoThinker is a framework that enhances multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with egocentric reasoning capabilities using spatio-temporal chain-of-thought supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at visible event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding needed for egocentric video reasoning, which requires inferring hidden intentions and recognizing fine-grained interactions from the agent's perspective.

Method: 1) Created EgoRe-5M dataset from 13M egocentric video clips with detailed CoT rationales and hand-object grounding; 2) Used supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on this dataset to teach reasoning skills; 3) Applied reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to enhance spatio-temporal localization.

Result: EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric benchmarks and achieves substantial improvements in fine-grained spatio-temporal localization tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap in egocentric reasoning capabilities for MLLMs through specialized dataset construction and two-stage training methodology.

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained

Motivation: To address the issue where parameter updates during training cause catastrophic degradation in image generation capability of pre-trained text-to-image models, while leveraging their rich visual priors for depth estimation.

Method: Introduces a play-and-plug framework with simple pluggable converters for switching between image generation and depth estimation modes, and proposes a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and improve utilization of additional learnable parameters.

Result: MERGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks while preserving the original image generation ability of the pre-trained model.

Conclusion: The pre-trained text-to-image model can be effectively expanded to depth estimation without compromising its original generation capabilities, demonstrating that these models can do more than just image generation.

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-
and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and
depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we
propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the
utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the
powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other

Motivation: Audio-driven human animation models suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. Existing solutions using keyframes as temporal anchors require additional generation stages and can restrict natural motion dynamics.

Method: Proposes Lookahead Anchoring which leverages keyframes from future timesteps ahead of the current generation window rather than within it. This transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons, allowing the model to continuously pursue future anchors while responding to immediate audio cues. Enables self-keyframing where the reference image serves as the lookahead target.

Result: The temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity and consistency. When applied to three recent human animation models, it achieves superior lip synchronization, identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal conditioning across different architectures.

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring effectively addresses identity drift in audio-driven human animation by using future keyframes as persistent guidance, eliminating the need for explicit keyframe generation while maintaining both identity consistency and natural motion dynamics.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

### [202] [FARMER: Flow AutoRegressive Transformer over Pixels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23588)
*Guangting Zheng,Qinyu Zhao,Tao Yang,Fei Xiao,Zhijie Lin,Jie Wu,Jiajun Deng,Yanyong Zhang,Rui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FARMER is a novel generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows and Autoregressive models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis directly from raw pixels, addressing challenges in pixel-level modeling through dimension reduction and efficient inference techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly modeling explicit likelihood of raw data distribution is key in machine learning, but continuous AR modeling over visual pixel data suffers from extremely long sequences and high-dimensional spaces, which FARMER aims to solve.

Method: FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive flow to transform images into latent sequences, uses self-supervised dimension reduction to partition NF latent channels into informative and redundant groups, implements one-step distillation for faster inference, and introduces resampling-based classifier-free guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

Conclusion: FARMER successfully unifies NF and AR models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image synthesis, overcoming challenges in pixel-level modeling through innovative dimension reduction and inference acceleration techniques.

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

*Erich Liang,Roma Bhattacharjee,Sreemanti Dey,Rafael Moschopoulos,Caitlin Wang,Michel Liao,Grace Tan,Andrew Wang,Karhan Kayan,Stamatis Alexandropoulos,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InFlux is a real-world benchmark providing per-frame ground truth camera intrinsics for 386 videos with dynamic intrinsics, featuring 143K+ annotated frames across diverse indoor/outdoor scenes to address the lack of dynamic intrinsics benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most 3D algorithms assume constant camera intrinsics in videos, but real-world videos often have dynamic intrinsics. The field lacks benchmarks with diverse scene content and per-frame intrinsic variations for consecutive video frames.

Method: Built a comprehensive lookup table of calibration experiments and extended the Kalibr toolbox to improve accuracy and robustness for obtaining per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations.

Result: Created InFlux benchmark with 143K+ annotated frames from 386 high-resolution indoor/outdoor videos capturing wide range of intrinsic variations and scene diversity. Evaluation shows existing methods struggle with dynamic intrinsics prediction.

Conclusion: InFlux addresses the critical gap in dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks and demonstrates that current methods are inadequate for handling videos with changing intrinsics, highlighting the need for improved approaches.

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

*Yuqian Yuan,Wenqiao Zhang,Xin Li,Shihao Wang,Kehan Li,Wentong Li,Jun Xiao,Lei Zhang,Beng Chin Ooi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelRefer is a unified region-level multimodal LLM framework that enables fine-grained object-centric understanding across images and videos, with an efficient variant called PixelRefer-Lite that reduces computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing MLLMs focus on holistic scene-level understanding and overlook fine-grained object-centric reasoning, creating a need for models that can perform detailed analysis on user-specified regions.

Method: Proposes Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact object representations from free-form regions, and PixelRefer-Lite variant with Object-Centric Infusion module that pre-fuses global context into object tokens for efficiency.

Result: Achieves leading performance with fewer training samples across benchmarks, with PixelRefer-Lite offering competitive accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: PixelRefer framework enables advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions, with efficient variants maintaining high semantic fidelity while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concerto is a minimalist approach for spatial concept learning that combines 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D scene perception and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human multisensory concept learning where abstract representations can be recalled from single modalities, the authors aim to develop a model that learns coherent spatial features through multimodal synergy.

Method: Concerto combines 3D intra-modal self-distillation with 2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding to learn spatial representations. It also includes variants for video-lifted point cloud understanding and a translator to project representations into CLIP's language space.

Result: Concerto outperforms standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised models by 14.2% and 4.8% respectively in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, it achieves 80.7% mIoU on ScanNet and sets new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Concerto learns spatial representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining intra-modal self-distillation with cross-modal joint embedding for spatial concept learning.

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

### [207] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Policy optimization in LLMs follows the path of least resistance, preferring simple answer-only formats over complex chain-of-thought reasoning even when the latter offers higher rewards, revealing a fundamental challenge for reward hacking in alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how policy optimization behaves when rigid think-then-answer constraints are relaxed into open-ended chain-of-thought structures, as this remains an under-studied area.

Method: Conducted extensive controlled experiments with various models and algorithms, including reward decomposition studies and KL-regularized policy analysis.

Result: Policy optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning and degenerate to direct answer-only formats, even when complex formats have 4x larger reward weights. PO systematically optimizes for simplest reward components first.

Conclusion: Granting policies freedom to diverge is necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts but creates strong incentives to game the simplest aspects of reward functions, posing critical challenges for alignment and reward hacking.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

*Chenheng Zhang,Tianqi Du,Jizhe Zhang,Mingqing Xiao,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language Ranker is a lightweight framework that treats LLM decoding as a ranking problem, using a small module to rerank candidate responses with minimal computational overhead while achieving performance comparable to large reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM research focuses on output distributions but neglects decoding processes. Current decoding methods like reward models are computationally expensive and limited. The paper aims to address redundancy and inefficiency in LLM generation by viewing decoding through a recommender system lens.

Method: Proposes Language Ranker framework that treats decoding as analogous to ranking in recommender systems. Uses a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features extracted by the base model, requiring only <0.5M additional parameters.

Result: Experiments across various tasks show Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models while significantly reducing computational overhead during both training and inference stages.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness in unlocking LLM capabilities, offering a practical alternative to computationally expensive decoding approaches with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE is a framework that evaluates how well LLM-generated explanations align with interpretable feature importance scores from logistic regression, revealing that correct predictions better cover supporting features while incorrect predictions show higher coverage of contradicting features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As ML is increasingly used in sensitive domains, there's a need for transparent AI. While LLMs can produce natural language explanations, it's unclear if these rationales truly capture the predictive signals behind decisions.

Method: RACE compares LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical features from logistic regression using token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques across four text classification datasets.

Result: Empirical results show consistent asymmetry: correct predictions have higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions show elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance matching reveals paraphrastic overlaps that boost coverage while preserving this asymmetry.

Conclusion: LLM rationales combine surface-level and flexible evidence reuse but can amplify misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides insights into LLM explanation faithfulness and establishes quantitative basis for evaluating reasoning completeness.

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A behavior-aware sampling framework that selects safety examples based on instruction-response behavior and semantic diversity can reduce catastrophic forgetting of safety behaviors during fine-tuning, achieving up to 41% reduction in harmfulness with minimal additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. While adding random safety examples can help, it's unclear which examples are most effective.

Method: Proposed a behavior-aware sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two factors: instruction-response behavior (refusal vs compliance) and semantic diversity across harm categories.

Result: The approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness, achieving up to 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5% additional training data.

Conclusion: Targeted data selection can significantly improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale by mitigating catastrophic forgetting of safety behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic isotropy as a method to assess trustworthiness of LLM-generated long-form responses by measuring embedding dispersion on the unit sphere, finding that higher isotropy correlates with lower factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing LLM response trustworthiness rely on expensive claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is impractical for long-form responses to open-ended prompts.

Method: Generate multiple long-form responses, embed them, and estimate semantic isotropy as the angular dispersion of embeddings on the unit sphere - requiring no labeled data, fine-tuning, or hyperparameter selection.

Result: Higher semantic isotropy (greater embedding dispersion) reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples, and the method outperforms existing approaches in predicting nonfactuality.

Conclusion: Semantic isotropy offers a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into real-world LLM workflows across multiple domains.

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

TL;DR: NetMind is a framework that uses natural language queries to understand network behaviors by addressing LLM limitations through tree-based configuration chunking, unified fact graphs, and hybrid programming language design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional network configuration analysis methods have steep learning curves and limited flexibility, while natural language offers more accessible interfaces. LLMs show promise but face challenges with long configurations, device heterogeneity, and complex reasoning requirements.

Method: 1) Tree-based configuration chunking for semantic coherence and efficient partitioning, 2) Unified fact graph as intermediate representation to normalize vendor-specific configurations, 3) Hybrid imperative-declarative language to reduce LLM reasoning burden and enhance precision.

Result: NetMind achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming existing baselines. The framework includes a benchmark with NL question-answer pairs paired with network configurations.

Conclusion: NetMind successfully addresses key challenges in NL-guided network understanding by combining configuration chunking, unified representation, and hybrid language design, enabling more accessible and effective network behavior analysis.

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IterSurvey is an iterative framework for automatic literature survey generation that uses recurrent outline generation and paper cards to improve content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality compared to one-shot approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-shot survey generation systems suffer from noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context overload, limiting survey quality. The authors were inspired by human researchers' iterative reading process.

Method: Uses recurrent outline generation with a planning agent that incrementally retrieves, reads, and updates outlines. Implements paper cards to distill papers' contributions, methods, and findings, and includes a review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement for multimodal integration.

Result: Substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and citation quality. Produces more accessible and better-organized surveys. Also introduces Survey-Arena benchmark for more reliable assessment.

Conclusion: IterSurvey provides a more effective approach to automatic literature survey generation through iterative processing and faithful paper-level grounding, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at

### [214] [Explaining and Mitigating Crosslingual Tokenizer Inequities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21909)
*Catherine Arnett,Tyler A. Chang,Stella Biderman,Benjamin K. Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates token premiums - disparities in token counts across languages in parallel text - and shows they persist even after controlling for dataset size, vocabulary size, and content. The authors train 7,000 monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages to understand cross-linguistic factors causing these premiums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High token premiums lead to reduced training throughput and increased inference costs. Understanding the cross-linguistic differences that cause these disparities is crucial for optimizing multilingual NLP systems.

Method: Trained approximately 7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. Measured token premiums and tested relationships with data similarity, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization, writing system, and word length.

Result: Similarity between training and test data doesn't impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and pre-tokenization do. Optimal vocabulary sizes can be determined for each language to significantly reduce token premium effects. Superword tokenizers that allow merges over whitespaces reduce token premiums and improve compression.

Conclusion: Intervening on vocabulary size or pre-tokenizer significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects, with superword tokenizers providing particularly effective solutions for both reducing token premiums and improving overall compression.

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

### [215] [Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21954)
*Mykola Haltiuk,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATT is a model-aware tokenizer transfer method that uses attention patterns to improve multilingual LLM adaptation, outperforming heuristic approaches by recovering most original performance quickly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizer transfer methods rely on semantic heuristics and ignore higher-layer model dynamics, limiting adaptation quality for lower-resource languages.

Method: Proposes Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT) with Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token communication patterns from source to target model, providing efficient warm-up before language modeling.

Result: Experiments show MATT recovers large fraction of original model's performance within few GPU hours, outperforming heuristic baselines across diverse linguistic settings.

Conclusion: Incorporating model-level signals offers practical and effective path toward robust tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can distinguish authors' writing styles by training individual models on each author's works, enabling accurate identification of authorship through prediction accuracy comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for identifying unique writing styles of different authors using language models, particularly for authorship attribution in cases where authorship is disputed or unknown.

Method: Train individual GPT-2 models from scratch on works of different authors, then compare prediction accuracy on held-out text from the target author versus other authors.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the approach on eight known authors and confirmed R. P. Thompson's authorship of the 15th Oz book, originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Conclusion: Language models trained on specific authors' works can effectively capture and identify unique writing styles, providing a reliable method for authorship attribution.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

### [217] [Uncovering the Persuasive Fingerprint of LLMs in Jailbreaking Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21983)
*Havva Alizadeh Noughabi,Julien Serbanescu,Fattane Zarrinkalam,Ali Dehghantanha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how persuasive strategies from social sciences can be used to jailbreak LLMs, showing that persuasion-aware prompts effectively bypass alignment safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite various jailbreak attack strategies, little research has examined the linguistic and psychological mechanisms influencing LLM vulnerability. The authors aim to leverage foundational persuasion theories to understand and exploit LLM susceptibility.

Method: The study draws on well-established persuasive strategies from social sciences to craft adversarial prompts. It hypothesizes that LLMs trained on human-generated text may respond more compliantly to persuasive structures, and investigates whether LLMs exhibit distinct persuasive fingerprints in their jailbreak responses.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly bypass safeguards and demonstrate potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.

Conclusion: This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight from social sciences in addressing evolving LLM safety challenges, highlighting how persuasive techniques can effectively circumvent alignment constraints.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

*Sarah Ball,Niki Hasrati,Alexander Robey,Avi Schwarzschild,Frauke Kreuter,Zico Kolter,Andrej Risteski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes why jailbreaking suffixes transfer across prompts and models, identifying three key statistical properties that correlate with transfer success: refusal direction activation, push away from refusal, and orthogonal shifts, while finding semantic similarity less important.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite empirical evidence of transferability in jailbreaking attacks, there's a lack of rigorous analysis of when and why these nonsensical suffixes work across different prompts and models they weren't optimized for.

Method: The researchers identified and measured three statistical properties across multiple experimental settings: refusal direction activation, push away from refusal direction, and orthogonal shifts, comparing these with prompt semantic similarity.

Result: The three statistical properties strongly correlate with transfer success, while prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates. These findings enable practical improvements in attack success through interventional experiments.

Conclusion: Transferability in jailbreaking attacks is better explained by specific statistical properties related to model internals rather than semantic similarity, providing a more fine-grained understanding that can translate to practical attack improvements.

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

### [219] [Penalizing Length: Uncovering Systematic Bias in Quality Estimation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22028)
*Yilin Zhang,Wenda Xu,Zhongtao Liu,Tetsuji Nakagawa,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates length bias in Quality Estimation (QE) metrics for machine translation, revealing systematic over-prediction of errors in longer translations and preference for shorter outputs, with proposed mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality Estimation metrics are crucial for reference-free evaluation and reinforcement learning in machine translation, but the prevalence and impact of length bias have been underexplored, risking unfair penalization of longer correct translations.

Method: Conducted systematic study of top-performing regression-based and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, then proposed two mitigation strategies: length normalization during training and incorporating reference texts during evaluation.

Result: Found two critical length biases: QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with increasing translation length (even for error-free texts) and exhibit preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are available for the same source text.

Conclusion: Both proposed strategies - length normalization during training and reference incorporation during evaluation - effectively reduce the identified length bias, addressing the risk of unfair penalization and sub-optimal decision-making in QE applications.

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Largest multilingual scaling laws study with 774 experiments across 10M-8B parameters, 400+ training languages, and 48 evaluation languages. Introduces Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) that outperforms existing methods by >0.3 R², with insights on cross-lingual transfer, optimal scaling strategies, and computational crossover points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the English-centric bias in scaling laws research and serve billions of international users by establishing scientific foundations for multilingual AI model development.

Method: Conducted 774 multilingual training experiments spanning various model sizes (10M-8B parameters) and languages. Developed ATLAS scaling law and analyzed cross-lingual transfer through empirical measurement of 1444 language pairs, plus language-agnostic scaling analysis.

Result: ATLAS significantly outperforms existing scaling laws in out-of-sample generalization. Derived cross-lingual transfer matrix showing mutual benefits between language pairs. Identified optimal scaling strategies and computational crossover points for pretraining vs finetuning decisions.

Conclusion: Provides scientific foundation for democratizing scaling laws across languages, enabling efficient multilingual model scaling beyond English-first approaches, with practical guidance for practitioners on optimal resource allocation and training strategies.

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how LLMs internally represent emotion by examining the geometry of their hidden-state space, identifying a low-dimensional emotional manifold that is directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and aligned with interpretable dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models internally represent and process emotion by analyzing the geometric structure of their hidden-state representations.

Method: The researchers analyzed the geometry of LLM hidden-state space, identified a low-dimensional emotional manifold, examined directional encoding and layer distribution, and tested cross-domain alignment across eight real-world emotion datasets in five languages. They also developed an intervention module to steer internal emotion perception.

Result: Found a universal emotional subspace with stable structures across depth that generalizes to multiple datasets and languages. Cross-domain alignment showed low error and strong linear probe performance. The intervention module successfully steered internal emotion perception while preserving semantics, with particularly strong control for basic emotions across languages.

Conclusion: LLMs contain a consistent and manipulable affective geometry that reveals how they internalize and process emotion, with emotional representations being directionally encoded and distributed across layers in a universal emotional subspace.

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

### [222] [Compositional Bias Control in Large Language Models: Preference Learning Fails, Supervision Succeeds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22084)
*Atij Mahesh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of 6 bias mitigation techniques for LLMs shows SFT achieves near-perfect compliance (99.87%) with high diversity, while DPO fails (4.53%). Preference-based methods cannot satisfy compositional constraints, requiring explicit supervision for fair and fluent generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs produce gender-stereotyped language even in neutral contexts, reflecting societal biases. While various mitigation techniques exist, their comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain poorly understood.

Method: Analyzed six control techniques: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding, SFT, DPO, and INLP. Evaluated on compositional constraint task requiring sentences with agentic and communal descriptors for 20 Winogender occupations.

Result: SFT achieved 99.87% compliance with high lexical diversity. DPO failed at 4.53% despite similar training stability. Ctrl-G guaranteed perfect compliance but severely reduced fluency and diversity. Preference-based learning cannot satisfy compositional constraints.

Conclusion: Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of compositional biases. Preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical structures, highlighting limitations of preference learning and necessity of explicit supervision for fair controlled generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), an inference-time algorithm to control LLMs' reasoning modes by identifying memorization reliance and steering computation toward generalization circuits, improving logical consistency and factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models exhibit unpredictable behavior with both remarkable generalization and brittle memorization, which undermines their reliability in high-stakes applications.

Method: Developed Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS) with: 1) lightweight linear probe to detect memorization reliance, 2) dynamic activation steering to push computation toward generalization circuits, framed as adaptive self-contrastive decoding.

Result: Experiments on reasoning and faithfulness tasks show DMS significantly improves logical consistency and factual accuracy.

Conclusion: DMS offers a principled approach to enhance LLM reliability by controlling reasoning modes through inference-time steering mechanisms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to long-context processing by applying logarithmic compression to input tokens instead of modifying transformer architecture, achieving improved performance on language modeling benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing methods for long-context processing complicate transformer architecture with mechanisms like recurrence or memory modules. The authors seek a simpler alternative that preserves architectural simplicity while extending context capabilities.

Method: The method applies scale-invariant logarithmic compression to input tokens, creating compressed representations that are processed by standard, unmodified transformers. This approach is inspired by cognitive models of human memory.

Result: Evaluation on WikiText-103 and PG-19 benchmarks shows reduced perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Performance consistently improves with longer compressed temporal contexts, demonstrating effective long-range memory extension.

Conclusion: Input-level logarithmic compression provides a simple and effective way to extend transformers' long-range memory capabilities without architectural modifications, offering an alternative to complex internal architecture changes.

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

Motivation: To create a scalable and efficient reasoning-focused language foundation that demonstrates sparse activation can enable scalable intelligence when properly aligned with reasoning objectives.

Method: Uses high-sparsity MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data with mid-training CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines.

Result: Models achieve up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared to dense counterparts, with Ling-1T establishing a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus computational efficiency at trillion scale.

Conclusion: Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for advancing future reasoning and thinking models, demonstrating that sparse activation enables scalable and efficient intelligence when aligned with reasoning objectives.

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,

series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense

architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OlaMind is a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework that uses a two-stage approach (Learn-to-Think and Learn-to-Respond) with SFT and RL to improve response quality and reduce business risks in retrieval-augmented dialogue systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICS systems using RAG suffer from hallucinations and generate rigid responses, which create business risks and poor user experience in web-based customer service scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: Learn-to-Think stage learns reasoning processes from human experts, then Learn-to-Respond stage uses cold-start SFT combined with RL for self-refinement from basic to hard tasks.

Result: Significant improvements in online A/B tests: +28.92%/+18.42% intelligent resolution rates and -6.08%/-7.12% human takeover rates in community-support/livestream-interaction scenarios respectively.

Conclusion: OlaMind effectively enhances human-likeness and naturalness while mitigating hallucinations and business risks, demonstrating consistent effectiveness across diverse real-world applications.

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

### [227] [SentiMaithili: A Benchmark Dataset for Sentiment and Reason Generation for the Low-Resource Maithili Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22160)
*Rahul Ranjan,Mahendra Kumar Gurve,Anuj,Nitin,Yamuna Prasad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first benchmark dataset for explainable sentiment analysis in Maithili, a low-resource Indo-Aryan language spoken by over 13 million people. The dataset contains 3,221 sentences annotated with sentiment polarity and natural language justifications in Maithili, validated by linguistic experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maithili is underrepresented in NLP research despite being spoken by millions. Low-resource languages like Maithili face challenges in dataset development due to limited linguistic experts and high annotation costs. Existing sentiment analysis resources for such languages are scarce, coarse-grained, and lack interpretability mechanisms.

Method: Created a novel dataset of 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment polarity with natural language justifications written in Maithili. The dataset was carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure label reliability and contextual fidelity. Conducted extensive experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art transformer architectures.

Result: The dataset was successfully developed and validated, demonstrating effectiveness for interpretable sentiment analysis. The Maithili-language justifications promote culturally grounded interpretation and enhance explainability of sentiment models.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, contributing a valuable resource to advance multilingual NLP and explainable AI. It addresses the scarcity of interpretable sentiment analysis resources for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

### [228] [DETECT: Determining Ease and Textual Clarity of German Text Simplifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22212)
*Maria Korobeynikova,Alessia Battisti,Lukas Fischer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DETECT is a new German-specific metric for evaluating automatic text simplification that addresses limitations of existing general-purpose metrics by holistically assessing simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency using synthetic LLM-generated training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current German ATS evaluation relies on inadequate general-purpose metrics that don't properly capture simplification quality across key dimensions, and there's a lack of German-specific metrics due to absence of human-annotated corpora.

Method: Adapted the LENS framework to German and extended it with: (1) pipeline for generating synthetic quality scores via LLMs to create datasets without human annotation, and (2) LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria with simplification requirements. Also constructed the largest German human evaluation dataset for validation.

Result: DETECT achieves substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates both the potential and limitations of LLMs for automatic evaluation and provides transferable guidelines for general language accessibility tasks beyond ATS.

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

### [229] [Estimating the Error of Large Language Models at Pairwise Text Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22219)
*Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper measures LLMs' error rates in pairwise text comparison tasks without relying on ground truth, using two scenarios: uniform error rate and binary positional bias. The method employs Copeland counting to construct rankings and estimate error rates across six LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify LLMs' reliability in pairwise text comparison tasks and understand their error patterns, particularly positional biases, without requiring ground truth data.

Method: Uses pairwise comparisons with two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate estimated via two comparisons per text pair with order variation, and (ii) binary positional bias with distinct error rates for different comparison orders using repeated comparisons. Applies Copeland counting to construct rankings.

Result: Tested six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Qwen) with five text types. Found similar positional bias terms close to uniform error. Claude showed best performance in error rates and prompt robustness. The proposed model outperformed biased Bradley-Terry model and commutativity score.

Conclusion: The method effectively measures LLMs' pairwise comparison errors without ground truth, revealing poor scalability of LLM-based comparisons. Claude performed best among tested models, and the proposed approach provides superior error indication compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

### [230] [Evolution of the lexicon: a probabilistic point of view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22220)
*Maurizio Serva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes limitations of the Swadesh approach for dating language divergence, highlighting inherent probabilistic constraints and introducing lexical modification as an additional important evolutionary process that improves dating accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unrealistic assumptions and inherent probabilistic limitations of the Swadesh method in lexicostatistics, and to demonstrate that considering lexical modification alongside word replacement improves temporal separation estimates.

Method: Mathematical analysis of probabilistic constraints in lexicostatistical dating, and incorporation of gradual lexical modification as a second stochastic process in language evolution models.

Result: The study reveals fundamental probabilistic limits to dating accuracy even with perfect assumptions, and shows that accounting for lexical modification significantly enhances precision in determining temporal separation between languages.

Conclusion: Lexicostatistical dating has inherent probabilistic limitations that constrain accuracy, but incorporating lexical modification as an additional evolutionary process substantially improves the precision of temporal separation estimates between languages.

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

### [231] [SteerX: Disentangled Steering for LLM Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22256)
*Xiaoyan Zhao,Ming Yan,Yilun Qiu,Haoting Ni,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Hong Cheng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SteerX is a novel activation steering method that disentangles preference-driven components from preference-agnostic ones using causal inference, improving LLM personalization by focusing only on truly relevant user preference signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing activation steering methods use all historical data to compute steering vectors, ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which weakens personalization effectiveness.

Method: SteerX uses causal inference theory to estimate token-level causal effects, identifies preference-driven tokens, transforms them into coherent descriptions, and leverages these to steer personalized LLM generation.

Result: Experiments on two representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets show that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality and personalization effectiveness.

Conclusion: SteerX provides a practical solution for more effective LLM personalization by focusing on genuinely preference-driven information rather than all historical data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PatenTEB is a comprehensive patent text embedding benchmark with 15 tasks and 2.06M examples, addressing patent-specific challenges like asymmetric retrieval. The patembed model family achieves state-of-the-art results through multi-task training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific challenges such as asymmetric fragment-to-document matching and domain-specific retrieval difficulties.

Method: Developed PatenTEB benchmark with domain-stratified splits, hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric scenarios. Created patembed model family through multi-task training with models spanning 67M to 344M parameters and up to 4096 token context lengths.

Result: patembed-base achieves SOTA on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445 previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM. Multi-task training improves external generalization despite minor benchmark costs.

Conclusion: Domain-pretrained initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. The comprehensive benchmark and model family address critical gaps in patent text embedding evaluation and performance.

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All

### [233] [From Slides to Chatbots: Enhancing Large Language Models with University Course Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22272)
*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Incorporating university course materials through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-modal slide presentation significantly improves LLM performance for computer science education questions compared to Continual Pre-Training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with accurate question answering in university-level computer science courses, and traditional methods don't effectively leverage diverse course materials like lecture slides (with visual elements) and transcripts (with spoken language).

Method: Compared two strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT). For lecture slides, developed a multi-modal RAG approach that presents retrieved content as images rather than just text.

Result: RAG proved more effective and efficient than CPT for small university course datasets. Multi-modal RAG with slides presented as images significantly outperformed text-only retrieval approaches.

Conclusion: RAG with multi-modal slide presentation is a practical strategy for developing AI educational assistants, offering better support for learning and teaching in computer science education contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

### [234] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or In-Context Learning? Evaluating LLMs for Clinical NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22285)
*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares BERT-style encoders, GPT-4o with few-shot in-context learning, and GPT-4o with supervised fine-tuning for clinical NER on the CADEC corpus, finding that SFT achieves the best performance but with higher cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare different approaches for clinical Named Entity Recognition, specifically examining the performance limits of BERT-style models and the effectiveness of LLMs with different prompting strategies.

Method: Compared three approaches: (1) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base, BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (2) GPT-4o with few-shot in-context learning using simple vs. complex prompts, and (3) GPT-4o with supervised fine-tuning. Evaluated on CADEC corpus with five entity types.

Result: RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT showed limited improvements over BERT Base. Simple ICL outperformed complex prompts, and SFT achieved the best overall performance (F1 ≈ 87.1%). LLMs performed better on simplified binary classification tasks.

Conclusion: Supervised fine-tuning of GPT-4o delivers the strongest clinical NER performance, though with higher computational cost, while simpler prompts work better than complex ones for in-context learning.

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Memory-based language modeling (OLIFANT) is presented as an efficient, eco-friendly alternative to deep neural networks, offering scalable performance with low ecological footprint using CPU-based k-nearest neighbor approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an efficient and environmentally sustainable alternative to energy-intensive deep neural network language models by leveraging memory-based approaches that are transparent and computationally lightweight.

Method: Implemented memory-based language modeling using fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor classification, relying fully on CPUs for both training and inference to achieve low token latencies.

Result: OLIFANT achieves log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance with strong memorization capabilities, showing competitive results compared to GPT-2 and GPT-Neo while having significantly lower estimated emissions and faster speeds.

Conclusion: Memory-based language modeling offers a viable, eco-friendly alternative to deep neural networks with transparent internal workings, efficient performance, and minimal environmental impact.

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

*Ethan Mines,Bonnie Dorr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first multilingual Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) benchmark across six languages and proposes a unified pipeline that achieves modest performance, highlighting the challenges of multilingual TSE compared to English-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior TSE work has been limited to English-only settings, creating a gap for multilingual analysis of public opinion on contested issues across different languages and cultures.

Method: Extends the original TSE pipeline to a multilingual setting using a unified model approach that doesn't require separate models for each language, covering Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and Spanish.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 12.78, demonstrating increased difficulty in multilingual TSE compared to English-only setups, with target prediction identified as the primary performance bottleneck.

Conclusion: Establishes the first multilingual TSE benchmark and baseline, revealing sensitivity of F1 scores to target verbalizations and providing essential resources for future multilingual TSE research.

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG is a novel agentic framework that transforms standard RAG into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process using an Iterative Refinement Cycle with Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA) to systematically identify and fill evidence gaps in complex multi-hop queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG frameworks often fail on complex multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from disparate sources, lacking robust mechanisms to identify and fill evidence gaps, which leads to noise propagation and incomplete context.

Method: FAIR-RAG introduces an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA), which deconstructs queries into required findings checklists, audits evidence to identify confirmed facts and explicit gaps, and uses an Adaptive Query Refinement agent to generate targeted sub-queries for missing information.

Result: FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, achieving an F1-score of 0.453 on HotpotQA (8.3-point absolute improvement over the strongest iterative baseline) and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: A structured, evidence-driven refinement process with explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

### [240] [VisJudge-Bench: Aesthetics and Quality Assessment of Visualizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22373)
*Yupeng Xie,Zhiyang Zhang,Yifan Wu,Sirong Lu,Jiayi Zhang,Zhaoyang Yu,Jinlin Wang,Sirui Hong,Bang Liu,Chenglin Wu,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VisJudge-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models' capabilities in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples across 32 chart types, revealing significant gaps between current MLLMs and human experts. The authors propose VisJudge, a specialized model that significantly improves performance in visualization quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visualization quality assessment is challenging as it requires simultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics. While MLLMs show promise in natural image aesthetic assessment, no systematic benchmark exists for evaluating their capabilities in visualization assessment, creating a critical gap in the field.

Method: The authors created VisJudge-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across 32 chart types. They then proposed VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment.

Result: Testing revealed that even the most advanced MLLMs (like GPT-5) exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts, with MAE of 0.551 and correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. VisJudge significantly narrowed this gap, reducing MAE to 0.442 (19.8% reduction) and increasing consistency with human experts to 0.681 (58.7% improvement).

Conclusion: Current MLLMs are inadequate for visualization quality assessment, but specialized models like VisJudge can significantly bridge the gap with human judgment. The VisJudge-Bench benchmark provides a valuable resource for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAP dataset is a multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in LLMs within scientific text generation, covering 9 languages with 900 questions and 7000+ annotated LLM answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in scientific text generation can distort factual knowledge, and the scientific domain's specialized terminology, statistical reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations exacerbate these distortions due to LLMs' limitations in comprehension and contextual understanding.

Method: Created a dataset with 900 curated scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 models across 5 high-resource and 4 low-resource languages, annotated with binary labels for scientific hallucinations (factuality errors) and fluency issues.

Result: The CAP dataset provides question-answer pairs with token sequences and logits, enabling research on hallucination detection and multilingual LLM evaluation in scientific contexts.

Conclusion: CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

### [242] [CHOIR: Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22475)
*Xiangjue Dong,Cong Wang,Maria Teleki,Millennium Bismay,James Caverlee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CHOIR is a test-time framework that leverages persona variations in LLMs to improve reasoning robustness by harmonizing multiple persona-conditioned reasoning signals into unified predictions through collaborative decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Persona variations in LLMs (even minor demographic perturbations) can lead to divergent correct answers, but instead of treating these as biases to mitigate, the authors explore their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness.

Method: CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and divergence in their reasoning paths to harmonize multiple persona-conditioned reasoning signals into a unified prediction.

Result: Experiments show CHOIR consistently enhances performance across demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks without additional training, with improvements up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and 19.2% on average across five demographics.

Conclusion: By reframing persona variation as a constructive signal rather than a bias, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable LLM reasoning that remains effective even with suboptimal base personas.

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

### [243] [The Tonogenesis Continuum in Tibetan: A Computational Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22485)
*Siyu Liang,Zhaxi Zerong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational approach using ASR models shows that pitch sensitivity follows a continuum across Tibetan dialects, revealing gradual stages of tonogenesis from atonal to fully tonal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computational method that quantifies pitch's functional role in tonogenesis, overcoming limitations of traditional comparative reconstruction and acoustic phonetics approaches.

Method: Used automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to measure performance degradation when pitch is flattened, analyzing closely related Tibetan languages at different stages of tonogenesis.

Result: Found a tonogenesis continuum: Amdo dialects (atonal) tolerate pitch removal most, U-Tsang varieties (fully tonal) show severe degradation, and Kham dialects fall between these extremes.

Conclusion: Computational methods can capture fine-grained sound change stages and reveal that traditional minimal pair-based functional load metrics may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems.

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

### [244] [Frustratingly Easy Task-aware Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22489)
*Yuanhe Tian,Junjie Liu,Xican Yang,Haishan Ye,Yan Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A task-aware pruning method for LLMs that preserves domain-specific capabilities while reducing model size by incorporating both general and task-specific calibration data into importance scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods focus on preserving general language fluency but neglect performance on specific domains and tasks, limiting practical deployment of compressed LLMs.

Method: Analyzes conventional pruning formulation and extends it by incorporating task-specific feature distributions. Computes separate importance scores using general and task-specific data, partitions parameters into shared/exclusive groups based on activation differences, and fuses scores to guide pruning.

Result: Experiments show the approach consistently outperforms baselines with identical pruning ratios across various settings on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively preserves LLMs' specialized capabilities under compression and can integrate seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

### [245] [The Limits of Data Scaling: Sub-token Utilization and Acoustic Saturation in Multilingual ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22492)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of Whisper's multilingual ASR model shows sub-token discovery follows exponential saturation patterns across 49 languages, with lexical diversity largely independent of pre-training data disparity. The study identifies acoustic saturation time (AST) and reveals script-based differences in sub-token utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how much audio is needed to observe a multilingual ASR model's sub-token inventory across languages and whether data disparity in pre-training affects token utilization during inference.

Method: Analyzed Whisper's decoding behavior across 49 languages by logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their cumulative discovery over time, studying utilization patterns of the model's sub-token space.

Result: Sub-token discovery follows consistent exponential saturation across languages, with total discovered tokens independent of pre-training hours. Latin script languages show more favorable patterns than Cyrillic, CJK, and Semitic scripts. Rank-frequency distributions follow Zipf-Mandelbrot law.

Conclusion: Sub-token utilization during multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by statistical, typological, and orthographic structure of speech than by training data scale, providing basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual evaluation.

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

*Michael Scott,Siyu Liang,Alicia Wassink,Gina-Anne Levow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of racial bias in commercial ASR systems using the PNWE corpus, showing systematic performance differences across ethnic groups due to sociophonetic variation, particularly vowel quality differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess racial bias in commercial automatic speech recognition systems and understand how sociophonetic variation contributes to differential performance across ethnic groups.

Method: Used the Pacific Northwest English corpus to analyze transcription accuracy across four ethnic backgrounds, introduced a Phonetic Error Rate metric linking errors to sociophonetic variables, and examined eleven sociophonetic features.

Result: Found that vowel quality variation, especially resistance to low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns, systematically correlates with differential error rates, with African American speakers showing the most pronounced effects across all systems.

Conclusion: Acoustic modeling of dialectal phonetic variation is a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems, and targeted representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data is needed to improve performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

### [247] [Text to Trust: Evaluating Fine-Tuning and LoRA Trade-offs in Language Models for Unfair Terms of Service Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22531)
*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates different adaptation methods for LLMs in legal domain tasks, specifically unfair clause detection in Terms of Service documents, comparing full fine-tuning, parameter-efficient methods (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have transformed text understanding but their adaptation to specialized legal domains is constrained by the high cost of full fine-tuning, creating a need for more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: The study evaluates three approaches: full fine-tuning of BERT and DistilBERT, parameter-efficient adaptation (4-bit LoRA) applied to TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and SaulLM models, and zero-shot prompting with GPT-4o and O-versions, using CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and Multilingual Scraper Corpus.

Result: Full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision-recall balance, while LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost, offering practical trade-offs between performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: The findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient domain-adapted LLMs and contribute open baselines for fine-tuning research in legal text processing, showing that parameter-efficient methods can provide competitive performance at significantly lower computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2 benchmark evaluates LLMs' long context understanding using real-world texts (16k-2M tokens) across law, finance, game, and code domains, revealing significant limitations despite extended context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have extended context windows but their long context understanding capabilities over long dependency tasks remain limited and underexplored, especially for real-world applications that were rarely benchmarked.

Method: Created LooGLE v2 benchmark with automatically collected real-world long texts and 10 types of domain-specific long-dependency tasks, generating 1,934 QA instances through a scalable data curation pipeline.

Result: Comprehensive assessment of 10 LLMs shows even the best-performing model achieves only 59.2% overall score, revealing LLMs can only understand much shorter context than claimed.

Conclusion: Despite extensive context windows, popular LLMs have significant limitations in handling real-world tasks with long dependencies, highlighting substantial room for improvement in practical long-context understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [249] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock is a semantic-aware KV cache eviction framework that uses adaptive block sizes to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency in long-context LLM inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing memory footprint of KV cache poses scalability bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference, and existing compression methods struggle to balance semantic coherence with memory efficiency.

Method: SABlock performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries with linguistic structures, applies segment-guided token scoring for importance estimation, and uses budget-driven search to adaptively determine optimal block sizes that preserve semantic integrity.

Result: On Needle-in-a-Haystack, SABlock achieves 99.9% retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching full-cache baseline (8K entries). Under 1,024 cache budget, it reduces peak memory by 46.28% and achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on 128K context.

Conclusion: SABlock consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under same memory budgets, demonstrating effective KV cache compression while maintaining semantic integrity and improving inference efficiency.

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

*Zhifeng Wang,Xinyue Zheng,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduLoop-Agent is an end-to-end personalized learning system that integrates neural cognitive diagnosis, adaptive testing, and LLM feedback in a closed-loop framework to provide individualized learning trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalized learning methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than as a closed loop, leading to coarse student models, assumption-bound adaptivity, and generic feedback.

Method: The system integrates three components: Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NCD) for fine-grained mastery estimation, Bounded-Ability Estimation Computerized Adaptive Testing (BECAT) for dynamic item selection, and LLMs for generating structured, actionable feedback.

Result: Experiments on ASSISTments dataset show NCD achieves strong response prediction with interpretable mastery assessments, adaptive recommendation improves item relevance and personalization, and LLM-based feedback provides targeted study guidance.

Conclusion: The proposed closed-loop framework is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), particularly those using large language models, and proposes research directions for developing fair and scalable evaluation methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid development of LLM-powered ITSs lacks reliable, universally accepted evaluation frameworks, leading to inconsistencies and limited generalizability in assessing their educational effectiveness.

Method: The authors analyze state-of-the-art evaluation practices through real-world case studies and build on insights from interdisciplinary AIED research to identify challenges and propose solutions.

Result: The paper identifies key challenges in current ITS evaluation practices and provides comprehensive analysis of evaluation methodologies through case studies.

Conclusion: Three practical, feasible, and theoretically grounded research directions are proposed, rooted in learning science principles, to establish fair, unified, and scalable evaluation methodologies for Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

TL;DR: AutoBench is an automated framework for evaluating LLMs using reciprocal peer assessment, where models take turns as question generators, contestants, and judges across domains, with iterative weighting for reliable evaluators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of static benchmarks like test-set contamination and limited adaptability by creating a dynamic, self-sustaining evaluation system.

Method: Uses reciprocal peer assessment with models alternating roles as question generators, contestants, and judges, incorporating iterative weighting to amplify reliable evaluators and aggregate peer judgments into consensus rankings.

Result: Shows strong correlations with established benchmarks (78% with MMLU-Pro, 63% with GPQA) and significantly outperforms single-judge baselines, demonstrating more robust and human-consistent assessments.

Conclusion: AutoBench provides a scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for continuous evaluation of evolving language models through distributed peer assessment.

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Result: The paper describes the architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of PCU as an emerging paradigm for ambient, adaptive health guidance.

Conclusion: PCU promises improved individual health outcomes and serves as a new foundation for public health and scientific discovery by integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level analytics.

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large-scale commonsense reasoning benchmarks for Persian language and create a challenging dataset that can evaluate model performance on Persian commonsense reasoning.

Method: Used conjunction-based segmentation to generate sentence-completion pairs from news and web sources, and developed DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and Adversarial Filtering) to create challenging distractors from gold continuations.

Result: Human annotators scored 89%, OpenAI-o3 achieved 92.18%, Claude-Sonnet-3.7 scored 91.17%, and the best open-source model DeepSeek-R1 reached 82.51%. DRESS-AF also successfully transferred to English HellaSwag benchmark.

Conclusion: PerCoR presents a challenging benchmark for Persian commonsense reasoning with significant performance gaps between models, and DRESS-AF proves effective for creating difficult distractors that transfer across languages.

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale

Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion using conjugate relation modeling that integrates neighborhood information and captures both stable semantics and uncertainty through diffusion processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FKGC methods struggle with complex relational patterns and data sparsity in knowledge graphs with limited samples.

Method: Uses neighborhood aggregation encoder, conjugate relation learner with implicit conditional diffusion and stable relation modules, and manifold conjugate decoder for inference.

Result: Achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed CR-FKGC framework effectively addresses FKGC challenges by modeling conjugate relations and handling data sparsity through advanced diffusion and manifold techniques.

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

*Joel Rorseth,Parke Godfrey,Lukasz Golab,Divesh Srivastava,Jarek Szlichta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first method to generate if-then rules for explaining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language models, using source presence/absence to explain output provenance with optimized rule generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide explainable AI for emerging RAG-based LLM systems by creating rules that link retrieved information sources to model outputs, addressing the need for transparency in how retrieved documents influence LLM decisions.

Method: Proposes optimized rule generation by probing LLMs with source combinations and applying Apriori-like pruning techniques from frequent itemset mining to efficiently identify meaningful rules connecting source presence/absence to consistent outputs.

Result: The paper presents both qualitative and quantitative experiments showing that the proposed solutions effectively generate meaningful explanation rules while maintaining computational efficiency compared to brute-force approaches.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables explainable AI for RAG-based LLM systems through efficient rule generation that connects retrieved source documents to model outputs, providing transparency in output provenance.

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class

*Qi Liu,Yanzhao Zhang,Mingxin Li,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E²Rank is a unified framework that extends text embedding models to perform both retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency by using cosine similarity and enhanced query prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text embedding models are efficient for retrieval but have limited ranking fidelity compared to dedicated rerankers, especially LLM-based listwise rerankers that capture fine-grained interactions.

Method: Extends a single text embedding model through continued training under listwise ranking objective, using cosine similarity as ranking function and enhanced query prompts constructed from original query and candidate documents.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on BEIR reranking benchmark, competitive performance on BRIGHT benchmark with low latency, and improves embedding performance on MTEB benchmark.

Conclusion: A single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Continual pre-training with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) adapts LLMs to Québécois French using minimal data and compute, improving dialect performance with under 1% parameter updates and minimal regression on standard French.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expand LLM capabilities beyond high-resource languages to minority dialects like Québécois French, addressing the dialect gap with cost-effective methods.

Method: Used continual pre-training with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient techniques to adapt three LLMs to Québécois French using a small dataset, evaluated on COLE benchmark suite.

Result: Achieved improvement on minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on prestige language benchmarks, updating under 1% of model parameters. Gains depend on corpus composition.

Conclusion: CPT with PEFT can effectively narrow the dialect gap, providing sustainable language resource creation and expanding LLM access to minority linguistic communities.

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

### [262] [Beyond Semantics: How Temporal Biases Shape Retrieval in Transformer and State-Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22752)
*Anooshka Bajaj,Deven Mahesh Mistry,Sahaj Singh Maini,Yash Aggarwal,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates temporal biases in LLMs' in-context learning, showing models prioritize tokens near sequence beginnings/ends and struggle with middle-position memories, similar to human episodic memory patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how temporal relationships govern in-context learning in LLMs, analogous to human episodic memory where temporal separation enables event retrieval.

Method: Used sequences with repeated tokens at fixed positions while permuting others to isolate temporal effects. Tested transformer and state-space models on next-token prediction across diverse sequences with ablation studies on induction heads.

Result: Models consistently favored tokens following repeated tokens but showed strong bias for beginning/end positions. Middle-position memories were retrieved less reliably. Both transformer and state-space models exhibited comparable temporal biases despite architectural differences.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit systematic temporal biases that enable temporal separation and episodic retrieval, deepening understanding of in-context learning mechanisms across different model architectures.

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

*Li Zhou,Lutong Yu,You Lyu,Yihang Lin,Zefeng Zhao,Junyi Ao,Yuhao Zhang,Benyou Wang,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EchoMind is a new benchmark for evaluating Speech Language Models' ability to perceive non-lexical vocal cues and generate empathetic responses, testing 12 advanced SLMs across sequential tasks involving spoken-content understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills crucial for human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. It remains unclear whether SLMs can fully perceive non-lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words and respond with empathy aligned with emotional and contextual factors.

Method: EchoMind simulates the cognitive process of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks using identical semantically neutral scripts free of explicit emotional cues. Controlled vocal style variations test delivery effects independent of transcript. The benchmark uses an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3 coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions with 39 vocal attributes, evaluated using objective and subjective metrics.

Result: Testing 12 advanced SLMs revealed that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses show persistent weaknesses in instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective use of vocal cues for empathy.

Conclusion: Current SLMs have significant limitations in integrating linguistic content with diverse vocal cues for empathetic conversation. The results underscore the need for models that can better combine these elements to achieve truly empathetic conversational ability.

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

this paper, we address this challenge and present our submissions to the Model
Compression track at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT 2025). In our
experiments, we investigate iterative layer pruning guided by layer importance
analysis. We evaluate this method using the Aya-Expanse-8B model for
translation from Czech to German, and from English to Egyptian Arabic. Our
approach achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference time,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMPersuade is a framework for studying how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be influenced by persuasive multimodal content, revealing that multimodal inputs significantly increase persuasion effectiveness compared to text alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LVLMs function as persuadees when exposed to persuasive multimodal content, as overly persuadable models may adopt misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical outputs when manipulated.

Method: Developed MMPersuade framework with (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset pairing images/videos with persuasion principles across commercial, subjective/behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation framework quantifying persuasion effectiveness via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token probabilities.

Result: Study of six leading LVLMs shows: (i) multimodal inputs substantially increase persuasion effectiveness compared to text alone, especially for misinformation; (ii) stated prior preferences reduce susceptibility but multimodal content maintains persuasive advantage; (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across contexts (reciprocity works best in commercial/subjective contexts, credibility/logic in adversarial contexts).

Conclusion: MMPersuade provides a principled foundation for developing LVLMs that are robust, preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive multimodal content.

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

*Junjielong Xu,Boyin Tan,Xiaoyuan Liu,Chao Peng,Pengfei Gao,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R4P is a patch verifier model that provides scalable rewards for training software engineering agents through reasoning, addressing limitations of test-based supervision by enabling efficient patch verification without heavy test sandboxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-based supervision for software engineering agents is unscalable due to heavy/fragile test sandboxes and rare high-coverage test data vulnerable to test hacking via edge cases.

Method: R4P treats patch verification as a reasoning task, using group-wise objectives for RL training to verify multiple patches against each other's modifications, providing dense rewards for stable training.

Result: R4P achieves 72.2% accuracy on SWE-bench-verified, verifies patches 50x faster than testing, and enables Mini-SE to achieve 26.2% Pass@1 (10% improvement over Qwen3-32B), further improved to 32.8% with test-time scaling.

Conclusion: R4P provides practical, scalable rewards for SWE agent training through efficient reasoning-based patch verification, demonstrating stable scaling and significant performance improvements over traditional test-based approaches.

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

*Poli Nemkova,Amrit Adhikari,Matthew Pearson,Vamsi Krishna Sadu,Mark V. Albert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic comparison of commercial vs. open-weight LLMs for human rights violation detection across 7 languages, showing that alignment (not scale) determines cross-lingual reliability and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humanitarian organizations face a critical cost-reliability trade-off between expensive commercial APIs and free open-weight models for multilingual human rights monitoring, particularly for low-resource languages in conflict zones where empirical validation is lacking.

Method: Evaluated 6 models (4 instruction-aligned commercial: Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0, GPT-4.1-mini; 2 open-weight: LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) across 78,000 multilingual inferences using standard classification metrics and new cross-lingual reliability measures: Calibration Deviation, Decision Bias, Language Robustness Score, and Language Stability Score.

Result: Aligned models maintained near-invariant accuracy and balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages (e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibited significant prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. Alignment, not scale, determines stability.

Conclusion: Multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning, providing practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,

standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

*Prerna Ravi,Dong Won Lee,Beatriz Flamia,Jasmine David,Brandon Hanks,Cynthia Breazeal,Emma Anderson,Grace Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how explicit thread linkages in synchronous group conversations can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves, providing methods for thread detection and showing that thread information enhances coding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how ideas develop in small-group conversations is critical for analyzing collaborative learning, but detecting threads in synchronous spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues, while LLMs struggle with long-context tasks that depend on tracing conversational links.

Method: The authors contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting strategies for automated threading, then test how threading influences performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks.

Result: Results show that providing clear conversational thread information improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue.

Conclusion: This work advances methods for combining LLMs and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time group interactions, discussing practical trade-offs in time and cost and emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can yield the best value.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

*Adam Stein,Neelay Velingker,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PIPS is a method that improves LLM reasoning by generating and refining programs at instance-level using structural feedback, with dynamic selection between direct inference and program synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-step reasoning despite methods like Chain of Thought and Program of Thought, which often produce undesirable solutions in algorithmic domains.

Method: Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS) generates and refines programs at instance-level using structural feedback without task-specific guidance, and incorporates a confidence metric to dynamically choose between direct inference and program synthesis.

Result: PIPS improves absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and 9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program generations by 65.1% on algorithmic tasks with Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Conclusion: PIPS effectively enhances LLM reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks by combining program synthesis with confidence-based dynamic selection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

*Linyang He,Tianjun Zhong,Richard Antonello,Gavin Mischler,Micah Goldblum,Nima Mesgarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A residual disentanglement method isolates lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning components from LLM embeddings to study brain processing hierarchy, revealing distinct neural signatures for reasoning that peak later and recruit visual regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the human brain progresses from simple linguistic processing to high-level reasoning, and overcome the limitation that conventional LLM-based brain encoding analyses are biased toward shallow linguistic features due to entangled representations.

Method: Introduces a residual disentanglement method that first probes an LM to identify feature-specific layers, then iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and reasoning.

Result: The isolated reasoning embedding uniquely predicts neural variance not explained by other features, recruits visual regions beyond classical language areas, peaks later (~350-400ms) than other linguistic signals, and shows standard LLM embeddings primarily reflect shallow features.

Conclusion: Disentangled embeddings reveal distinct neural substrates for reasoning that follow a processing hierarchy, while standard LLM embeddings can be misleading by masking deeper cognitive contributions.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

### [273] [Interpreting and Mitigating Unwanted Uncertainty in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22866)
*Tiasa Singha Roy,Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri,Ilias Triantafyllopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates uncertainty in LLMs where correct answers flip to incorrect ones upon re-prompting. Using a modified Needle-in-a-Haystack framework, the authors identify specific attention heads that cause this behavior and show that masking them reduces flip behavior by up to 15% without negative side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models exhibit unwanted uncertainty where they change previously correct answers to incorrect ones when re-prompted, which undermines trust and poses risks in high-stakes domains.

Method: Adapted the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval framework and integrated a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate answer-flipping scenarios. Identified specific non-retrieval attention heads that attend to misleading tokens and tested masking these heads.

Result: Masking the identified attention heads reduced flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing incoherence or overcorrection. However, trade-offs were observed when tested on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs, though trade-offs exist with downstream task performance.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about content authenticity and misinformation in the era of increasingly human-like AI-generated text by providing large-scale, diverse datasets for reliable detection and attribution.

Method: Created dataset combining original NY Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple LLMs (Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B, Yi-Large, GPT-4-o) using article abstracts as prompts.

Result: Baseline results show 58.35% accuracy for distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, and 8.92% accuracy for attributing AI texts to their generating models.

Conclusion: The dataset bridges real-world journalistic content with modern generative models to catalyze development of robust detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust

*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the ragged tensor problem in batch speculative decoding for LLMs, introduces EQSPEC for correctness verification, and EXSPEC for efficient batch processing with dynamic grouping to maintain output equivalence while achieving 3x throughput improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending speculative decoding to batches is essential for production serving, but introduces the ragged tensor problem where sequences accept different numbers of draft tokens, breaking alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention masks, and KV-cache state.

Method: The authors characterize synchronization requirements for correctness, present EQSPEC to expose realignment overhead, and introduce EXSPEC which maintains a sliding pool of sequences and dynamically forms same-length groups to reduce realignment overhead while preserving speculative speedups.

Result: On SpecBench dataset across multiple target/draft model pairs, the approach achieves up to 3x throughput improvement at batch size 8 compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8 while maintaining 95% output equivalence.

Conclusion: The proposed method requires no custom kernels and integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks, providing an efficient solution to the ragged tensor problem in batch speculative decoding while maintaining output correctness.

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

### [276] [Language Server CLI Empowers Language Agents with Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22907)
*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI is a CLI-first orchestration layer that integrates Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers to provide deterministic, replayable workflows for coding agents and CI, addressing hallucinations and edit mislocalization in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while language servers provide verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. The motivation is to bridge this gap by leveraging language servers' structural information and actionable process rewards.

Method: Lanser-CLI introduces: (i) a robust addressing scheme using a Selector DSL with relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles with stable content hashes; (iii) safety envelope for mutating operations with preview and transactional apply; (iv) process-reward functional derived from Language Server facts.

Result: The system provides deterministic workflows under frozen snapshots with a monotonicity property for process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and counterfactual analysis.

Conclusion: Lanser-CLI successfully mediates LSP servers to provide machine-checked, step-wise signals that align agents' planning loops with program reality, offering a robust solution for coding agents and CI workflows.

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

TL;DR: Infinity-Chat is a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse, real-world open-ended user queries that reveals an 'Artificial Hivemind' effect in language models, where models show both intra-model repetition and inter-model homogeneity in creative generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative content, raising concerns about homogenization of human thought through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Current methods for evaluating LM output diversity are limited beyond narrow tasks.

Method: Created Infinity-Chat dataset with 26K diverse open-ended queries and developed a comprehensive taxonomy with 6 top-level categories and 17 subcategories. Conducted large-scale study of mode collapse with 31,250 human annotations across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences.

Result: Revealed pronounced Artificial Hivemind effect: (1) intra-model repetition where single models generate similar responses, and (2) inter-model homogeneity where different models produce strikingly similar outputs. LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less calibrated to human ratings when preferences differ.

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat provides the first large-scale resource for systematically studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks from the Artificial Hivemind effect.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG) is a lightweight data augmentation method that improves LLM performance on long-context QA tasks by adding tags or tag definitions to prompts, achieving up to 17% improvement on 32K token contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs have limitations in effective QA and reasoning over long contexts, and existing approaches like RAG are sensitive to chunking/retrieval strategies and require extensive preprocessing.

Method: Propose TAG - a lightweight data augmentation strategy that boosts LLM performance by tagging contexts or adding tag definitions into QA prompts without altering document integrity.

Result: Consistent performance gains over baseline: up to 17% for 32K token contexts and 2.9% improvement in complex multi-hop reasoning QA on NoLima and NovelQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAG provides an effective, lightweight alternative to complex retrieval approaches for improving LLM performance in long-context scenarios.

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread adoption of LLMs raises concerns about factual accuracy in high-risk domains like biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods for short texts fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning chains and cumulative information.

Method: Proposed a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets, multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. Constructed LongHalluQA (Chinese long-form factuality dataset) and developed MAD-Fact (debate-based multi-agent verification system) with a fact importance hierarchy.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks showed that larger LLMs generally maintain higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content.

Conclusion: The work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in sensitive domains.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in

TL;DR: This paper introduces custom LLMs using sentence-level embeddings to measure teaching quality from classroom transcripts, achieving human-level performance and alignment with teacher value-added measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is challenging in education. General-purpose LLMs struggle with complex classroom observation instruments, necessitating specialized approaches.

Method: Uses custom LLMs built on sentence-level embeddings with five different sentence embeddings evaluated under data-efficient training to prevent overfitting. Analyzes annotation context windows to understand model behavior.

Result: Specialized models achieve human-level and super-human performance (expert human ratings >0.65), surpassing average human-human rater correlation. Aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added measures, though individual item-level generalization remains limited.

Conclusion: Establishes a viable methodology for AI-driven instructional measurement, offering scalable, reliable, and valid feedback for educator development, though full generalization has not yet been achieved.

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

*Shenran Wang,Timothy Tin-Long Tse,Jian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates in-context learning (ICL) across transformer, state-space, and hybrid LLMs, finding that while different architectures can achieve similar task performance, their internal mechanisms differ significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different LLM architectures (transformer, state-space, hybrid) implement in-context learning and whether similar behavioral performance masks different internal mechanisms.

Method: Combined behavioral probing and intervention-based methods to analyze ICL across two categories of knowledge-based tasks, examining function vectors (FVs) in self-attention and Mamba layers.

Result: Function vectors for ICL are primarily located in self-attention and Mamba layers, with Mamba2 potentially using different mechanisms. FVs are crucial for parametric knowledge retrieval but not for contextual knowledge understanding.

Conclusion: Different LLM architectures can achieve similar ICL performance through different internal mechanisms, highlighting the importance of combining behavioral and mechanistic analyses for understanding LLM capabilities.

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both

*Ran Xu,Jingjing Chen,Jiayu Ye,Yu Wu,Jun Yan,Carl Yang,Hongkun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TIR-Judge is an RL framework that trains LLM judges to use code execution for more accurate evaluation, outperforming text-only judges and achieving strong performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM judges rely only on text-based reasoning, which limits their ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computations, creating a need for more precise evaluation methods.

Method: End-to-end RL framework with code executor integration, featuring diverse training across domains, flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and iterative RL without distillation.

Result: Outperforms reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 with only 8B parameters, and matches distilled variants without using distilled trajectories.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative reinforcement learning, demonstrating that code execution integration enables more accurate and scalable evaluation without requiring distillation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

### [284] [Knocking-Heads Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23052)
*Zhanchao Zhou,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes knocking-heads attention (KHA) to enable cross-head interactions in multi-head attention mechanisms, improving training stability and performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multi-head attention and its variants concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction, limiting their representational capacity despite increasing head count.

Method: KHA enables attention heads to interact through a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix applied before scaled dot-product attention, preserving head specialization while learning integrated representations.

Result: When trained on a 6.1B parameter MoE model with 1T tokens, KHA showed superior training dynamics and better performance across downstream tasks compared to baseline attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: KHA effectively enhances multi-head attention by enabling cross-head interactions with minimal parameter and computational cost, leading to improved model performance and training stability.

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

### [285] [Quality-Aware Translation Tagging in Multilingual RAG system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23070)
*Hoyeon Moon,Byeolhee Kim,Nikhil Verma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QTT-RAG improves multilingual RAG by evaluating translation quality across semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness/fluency, then attaching these scores as metadata to help LLMs make better decisions without altering content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mRAG approaches either assume good translation quality or use rewriting methods that cause factual distortion and hallucinations, which degrades performance in low-resource language settings.

Method: Proposes Quality-Aware Translation Tagging (QTT-RAG) that explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensions and attaches scores as metadata without modifying original content.

Result: Outperforms CrossRAG and DKM-RAG baselines on XORQA and MKQA benchmarks using six LLMs (2.4B-14B parameters) across Korean, Finnish, and Chinese, preserving factual integrity while enabling better generator decisions.

Conclusion: QTT-RAG provides a practical and robust solution for effectively using cross-lingual documents in low-resource settings with limited native language documents across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a

### [287] [MAP4TS: A Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework for Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23090)
*Suchan Lee,Jihoon Choi,Sohyeon Lee,Minseok Song,Bong-Gyu Jang,Hwanjo Yu,Soyeon Caren Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAP4TS is a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that incorporates classical time-series analysis into prompt design for LLM-based forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across eight datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal approaches for time-series forecasting with LLMs often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies fundamental to time-series data, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: The framework introduces four specialized prompt components: Global Domain Prompt (dataset-level context), Local Domain Prompt (recent trends and series-specific behaviors), Statistical and Temporal Prompts (handcrafted insights from ACF, PACF, and Fourier analysis). These are combined with raw time-series embeddings through cross-modality alignment.

Result: MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods across eight diverse datasets. Ablation studies show prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability, and GPT-2 backbones with structured prompts outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed MAP4TS framework successfully bridges the gap in time-series forecasting by explicitly incorporating classical time-series analysis into prompt design, demonstrating that structured prompts with smaller models can achieve superior performance compared to larger models.

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

*Yi-Li Hsu,Katelyn X. Mei,Lucy Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hierarchical structures in medical multi-document summarization improve model-generated summaries by enhancing clarity while maintaining content coverage and factuality, with human experts preferring model outputs over human-written summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether incorporating hierarchical structures in medical multi-document summarization can improve a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents compared to traditional flat summarization methods.

Method: Investigated two hierarchical organization approaches across three large language models, with comprehensive evaluations using automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation across multiple quality dimensions.

Result: Human experts preferred model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches preserved factuality, coverage, and coherence while increasing human preference. GPT-4 judgments showed higher agreement with human experts on objective evaluation facets.

Conclusion: Hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

*Tomáš Sourada,Jana Straková*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A compact single-model approach for multilingual inflection that generates inflected word forms from base lemmas across 73 languages, outperforming monolingual baselines while being lightweight and robust to unseen words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of an open-source, general-purpose multilingual morphological inflection system capable of handling unseen words across many languages, simplifying deployment by eliminating the need for multiple monolingual models.

Method: Joint training on data from 73 languages using a novel frequency-weighted, lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure, evaluated on both SIGMORPHON benchmarks and 73 Universal Dependencies treebanks.

Result: The multilingual model outperforms monolingual baselines in most languages, demonstrating robustness to unseen words and effectiveness across diverse languages including Czech.

Conclusion: Multilingual modeling is highly effective for inflection tasks, offering practical deployment benefits by replacing dozens of separate monolingual models with a single compact model.

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

### [290] [Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23123)
*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopLoRA introduces token-wise projected low-rank adaptation that dynamically adjusts LoRA weights based on input tokens, enabling more granular adaptation without increasing rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LoRA shares the same weights across all input tokens, limiting its ability to capture token-specific information due to semantic differences among tokens.

Method: TopLoRA uses dynamic token-wise weights expressed as BΣ_XA, where A and B are low-rank matrices and Σ_X is a diagonal matrix generated from each input token X, learning token-wise input-output projections end-to-end.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that TopLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants.

Conclusion: TopLoRA achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA weights without increasing the rank, providing superior performance over standard LoRA approaches.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

### [291] [Corpus Frequencies in Morphological Inflection: Do They Matter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23131)
*Tomáš Sourada,Jana Straková*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores incorporating corpus frequency information into morphological inflection systems through frequency-weighted train-test splits, token accuracy evaluation, and frequency-aware training sampling, showing improved performance in most languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional morphological inflection systems treat all lexical entries uniformly without considering their real-world frequency distribution, which doesn't reflect actual deployment scenarios where user inputs follow natural text frequency patterns.

Method: Three frequency-aware approaches: (1) frequency-weighted lemma-disjoint train-dev-test splits, (2) token accuracy evaluation alongside type accuracy, and (3) frequency-aware training data sampling that explicitly incorporates word frequency.

Result: Frequency-aware training outperformed uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages tested, demonstrating the value of incorporating frequency information.

Conclusion: Incorporating corpus frequency information into morphological inflection systems through multiple dimensions improves performance and better reflects real-world deployment scenarios, with frequency-aware training being particularly effective.

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

*Zile Yang,Ling Li,Na Di,Jinlong Pang,Yao Zhou,Hao Cheng,Bo Han,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ENTP framework revitalizes low-quality SFT data through neural-symbolic purification and reconstruction, outperforming 13 data-selection baselines and even full dataset fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quality-first SFT approaches discard valuable signals in low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters, overlooking the potential of noisy samples.

Method: ENTP uses symbolic purification to prune noisy samples based on statistical priors, and neural reconstruction to synthesize enriched instruction-response pairs using latent representations and model knowledge.

Result: ENTP-augmented datasets from low-quality data outperform 13 established data-selection baselines across five benchmarks and surpass fine-tuning on the full original dataset (~300K examples).

Conclusion: Low-quality data has untapped potential, and intelligent purification and synthesis are crucial for efficient instruction alignment in SFT.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

*Hang Lei,Shengyi Zong,Zhaoyan Li,Ziren Zhou,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR framework decouples creative narrative generation from format conversion to enable LLMs to produce high-quality screenplays, achieving 75% win rate against strong baselines and 82.7% of human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct end-to-end LLM generation fails to produce well-crafted screenplays because it forces a single model to simultaneously master creative narrative construction and rigid format adherence, resulting in outputs that lack structural integrity and storytelling substance.

Method: Dual-Stage Refinement (DSR) framework with two stages: first transforms brief outline into rich novel-style prose, then refines this narrative into professionally formatted screenplay. Uses hybrid data synthesis (reverse synthesis deconstructs existing screenplays, forward synthesis generates narrative texts) to address training data scarcity.

Result: Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show DSR achieves 75% win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of human-level performance.

Conclusion: Decomposed generation architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in complex creative domains like screenplay writing.

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

*Marah Ghoummaid,Vladimir Tchuiev,Ofek Glick,Michal Moschkovitz,Dotan Di Castro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATCH is a novel reference-free metric for evaluating AI-generated code that uses contrastive learning to create embeddings for code and natural language descriptions, enabling similarity scoring that better reflects functional correctness than existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evaluation methods for AI-generated code are unscalable (unit tests) or fail to capture functionality (syntactic metrics). Existing reference-free alternatives are limited, creating a need for better evaluation metrics that don't require reference code.

Method: MATCH uses contrastive learning to generate meaningful embeddings for both code and natural language task descriptions, then computes similarity scores between them to assess how well the generated code implements the intended task.

Result: MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages, outperforming alternatives like ICE-Score.

Conclusion: MATCH provides an effective reference-free evaluation metric for AI-generated code that better captures functional alignment with developer intent compared to current approaches.

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

*Shuai Huang,Wenxuan Zhao,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SI-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating social intelligence in LLMs using 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues from real social interactions, addressing limitations of previous simulated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods rely on simulated agent-to-agent interactions that fail to capture authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human conversations, creating a gap in assessing social intelligence.

Method: Created SI-Bench with 2,221 authentic dialogues from social networking applications, grounded in social science theories, and manually annotated 312 dialogues across 8 major LLM models to evaluate social intelligence.

Result: State-of-the-art models surpassed human experts in process reasoning for complex social situations but still lagged behind humans in reply quality. Chain-of-Thought reasoning actually degraded LLM performance in social dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: SI-Bench provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating social intelligence in LLMs, revealing both strengths (process reasoning) and weaknesses (reply quality) of current models compared to human performance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DREAM method uses transfer learning for drug-drug relation extraction from medical texts, validates results with LLM, achieving 71% agreement on PubMed abstracts while revealing domain ambiguities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited datasets exist for drug-drug relation extraction, making transfer learning necessary to apply machine learning methods in this medical domain.

Method: DREAM employs a trained relation extraction model to discover relations between entities, applies it to medical text corpus to build drug relationship ontology, then validates extracted relations using large language model.

Result: Quantitative analysis shows LLM agreed with 71% of relations extracted from PubMed abstracts subset. Qualitative analysis reveals the approach can uncover medical domain ambiguities.

Conclusion: The method successfully extracts drug-drug relations using transfer learning and LLM validation, while highlighting challenges and ambiguities in medical relation extraction.

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

### [297] [Process Reward Models for Sentence-Level Verification of LVLM Radiology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23217)
*Alois Thomas,Maya Varma,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Curtis P. Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) for detecting hallucinations in radiology reports generated by Large Vision-Language Models, achieving strong performance and generalization across different LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce clinically critical hallucinations in radiology reports, posing serious risks, and existing detection methods lack sentence-level granularity and robust generalization across different generators.

Method: A lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM that predicts factual correctness of each generated sentence conditioned on clinical context and preceding text, fine-tuned on MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels.

Result: Outperforms existing verification techniques with 7.5% improvement in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in AUROC over white-box baselines. Shows strong generalization to unseen LVLMs and improves F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% when filtering worst 10% of reports.

Conclusion: A lightweight, context-aware PRM provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without requiring access to internal activations, effectively detecting and mitigating hallucinations in radiology reports.

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ben-10, a 78-hour Bengali speech corpus, and shows that speech foundation models struggle with regional dialect ASR, with dialect-specific training being more effective than fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of dialectal variations on automatic speech recognition, particularly for low-resource languages like Bengali where regional dialects are typically treated as fine-tuning tasks rather than primary research focus.

Method: Developed a 78-hour annotated Bengali Speech-to-Text corpus (Ben-10) and conducted experiments using speech foundation models in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, comparing performance with dialect-specific model training.

Result: Speech foundation models struggle heavily with regional dialect ASR in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. All deep learning methods have difficulty modeling speech data under dialectal variations, but dialect-specific model training helps alleviate the issue.

Conclusion: The Ben-10 dataset serves as an out-of-distribution resource for ASR modeling under constrained resources, highlighting the need for specialized approaches to handle dialectal variations in speech recognition systems.

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the

*Bang Xiao,Lingjie Jiang,Shaohan Huang,Tengchao Lv,Yupan Huang,Xun Wu,Lei Cui,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new pipeline to improve aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code using a large instruction-tuning dataset (AesCode-358K), multi-agent reward feedback system, and GRPO-AR algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks but struggle with visually-oriented coding tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics in code output.

Method: Constructed AesCode-358K dataset, proposed agentic reward feedback system with multi-agent evaluation, developed GRPO-AR algorithm for joint optimization, and created OpenDesign benchmark for assessment.

Result: Combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly improves performance on OpenDesign and existing benchmarks. AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, achieving performance comparable to large open-source models with 480B-685B parameters.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances code aesthetics in LLM-generated code, demonstrating that specialized training and optimization can significantly improve visual quality while maintaining functionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCoRec, a multi-modal task for recognizing overlapping conversations in cocktail-party scenarios using audio, visual, and contextual cues, achieving 50% improvement over audio-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cocktail-party problem of overlapping conversations in natural multi-party settings with extreme speech overlap (up to 100%) and fragmented conversational turns.

Method: Uses audio-visual recordings of unscripted casual group chats, requiring systems to jointly transcribe speech and cluster speakers into conversations by answering "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?".

Result: Audio-only baselines exceed 100% word error rate, while incorporating visual cues yields substantial 50% improvements, demonstrating the critical importance of multi-modal approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-modal context-aware recognition is essential for handling extreme speech overlap scenarios, with visual cues providing significant performance gains over audio-only methods in natural conversational settings.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fully automated data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including adaptive data repair and error data augmentation, combined with multi-model collaboration training and ensemble strategies to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While agent-based frameworks have improved text-to-SQL tasks, the impact of data-centric strategies remains unexplored. The authors aim to address this gap by developing automated data-centric approaches to enhance model performance.

Method: The method includes: 1) Adaptive data repair to automatically find and fix errors in training data; 2) Error data augmentation by diffusing and enhancing erroneous data; 3) Multi-model collaboration training with different augmented data; 4) Ensemble strategy to integrate multiple models' capabilities.

Result: The proposed approach achieved first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models (within 70B parameters), demonstrating the effectiveness of the data-centric pipeline and multi-model interactive iterative strategies through experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Data-centric strategies combined with multi-model collaboration and ensemble methods significantly improve text-to-SQL task performance, showing that systematic data quality improvement and model diversity are crucial for achieving state-of-the-art results in lightweight models.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

TL;DR: Arabic Little STT dataset addresses data scarcity for Levantine Arabic child speech, showing Whisper ASR models struggle significantly with child speech (0.66 WER) compared to adult speech (<0.20 WER).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Arabic suffer from severe data scarcity, particularly the absence of child-specific speech corpora, which poses significant challenges for AI systems.

Method: Created Arabic Little STT dataset with 355 utterances from 288 children (ages 6-13), then systematically assessed eight Whisper ASR model variants on this dataset and compared with adult Arabic benchmarks.

Result: Even the best-performing Whisper model (Large_v3) achieved 0.66 word error rate on child speech, starkly contrasting with sub 0.20 WER on adult datasets, aligning with similar findings in English speech research.

Conclusion: Critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and inclusive training data in ASR development, with strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child information. The publicly available dataset aims to enrich children's demographic representation in ASR datasets.

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

Motivation: LLM alignment remains challenging, and inference-time methods often apply uniform computational effort which yields suboptimal alignment. The authors hypothesize that initial tokens of responses are disproportionately more critical for many alignment tasks.

Method: Introduce AdaSearch, a blockwise search strategy that adaptively allocates fixed computational budget using a sampling schedule to focus search effort on critical initial tokens. Also introduce AdaBeam, its tree-search counterpart, applied to sequential decoding.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs shows AdaSearch outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Win-rates improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment generation, and mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

Conclusion: AdaSearch effectively leverages the principle that initial tokens are critical for alignment tasks, providing superior performance through adaptive computational budget allocation compared to existing methods.

Result: Achieved 30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement compared with mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini. When incorrect BaZi information is used, the model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the importance of culturally grounded symbolic reasoning.

Conclusion: The BaZi-LLM system demonstrates the potential of culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character simulation, providing a scalable approach to generating dynamic virtual personas.

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and

Motivation: Address the bottleneck of high-quality knowledge graph scarcity by overcoming limitations of existing methods that rely on error-prone pattern matching or resource-intensive large language models, making KG extraction more accessible for low-resource environments.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction that integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into unified graph structure, reducing complex semantic processing needs; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference that leverages graph topology to efficiently infer relationships without requiring complex language understanding capabilities.

Result: Enables accurate knowledge graph construction with minimal hardware requirements, bridging the gap between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: LightKGG provides scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing small language model efficiency in structured NLP tasks, making knowledge graph extraction more accessible and practical for various deployment environments.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate how well LLMs can forecast AI's effects on job demand, using sector-level job postings and AI occupational change projections with temporal splits to prevent data leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of tools to systematically forecast AI's effects on employment, despite AI reshaping labor markets. While LLMs can extract sentiment and summarize economic reports, their use for forward-looking labor prediction remains unassessed.

Method: Combines US sector-level job postings with global AI occupational change projections into forecasting tasks with temporal splits. Evaluates LLMs using task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and hybrid prompting strategies across model families.

Result: Structured task prompts improve forecast stability, while persona prompts work better for short-term trends. Performance varies significantly across sectors and time horizons, showing the need for domain-aware prompting.

Conclusion: The benchmark supports future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based economic reasoning, providing a reproducible testbed for studying AI's forecasting capabilities in labor markets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes religious language in climate discourse using both rule-based methods and LLMs, finding that vocabulary-based approaches detect more religious content than contextual AI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how religious language persists in secular environmental discourse and develop computational methods to detect both explicit and implicit religious references in climate-related texts.

Method: Dual approach: rule-based model using hierarchical tree of religious terms from ecotheology literature, and large language models in zero-shot setting, applied to 880,000+ sentences from NGO texts.

Result: Rule-based method consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs, revealing methodological challenges in detecting religious language and tensions between vocabulary-based vs. contextual definitions.

Conclusion: Study demonstrates both potential and limitations of computational approaches for analyzing religious language persistence in climate discourse, contributing to digital methods in religious studies.

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Mixture of Experts framework combining state-of-the-art TSF models (xLSTM, enhanced Linear, PatchTST, minGRU) with Transformer-based gating achieves superior performance on time series forecasting benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent debates about Transformer effectiveness in time series forecasting, with conflicting results showing simple models sometimes outperform complex ones. The challenge of TSF data favoring recent past and unpredictable events.

Method: Proposes a Mixture of Experts framework integrating SOTA models (xLSTM, enhanced Linear, PatchTST, minGRU) using a Transformer-based MoE gating network to combine their complementary strengths.

Result: Outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest MoE-based approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed MoE framework effectively combines diverse forecasting models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting.

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

*Zhuoran Jin,Hongbang Yuan,Kejian Zhu,Jiachun Li,Pengfei Cao,Yubo Chen,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-Reward addresses modality imbalance and preference rigidity in reward models by introducing a comprehensive framework with a benchmark (Omni-RewardBench), dataset (Omni-RewardData), and models (Omni-RewardModel) supporting multiple modalities and free-form preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models face two key challenges: modality imbalance (limited support beyond text and image) and preference rigidity (inability to capture complex personalized preferences from fixed binary pairs).

Method: Proposed Omni-Reward framework with three components: (1) Omni-RewardBench benchmark covering 9 tasks across 5 modalities, (2) Omni-RewardData with 248K general preference pairs and 69K instruction-tuning pairs, (3) Omni-RewardModel including both discriminative and generative reward models.

Result: The Omni-RewardModel achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench and other widely used reward modeling benchmarks, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple modalities.

Conclusion: Omni-Reward represents a significant step toward generalist omni-modal reward modeling that supports free-form preferences and addresses the limitations of current reward models.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

*Litu Ou,Kuan Li,Huifeng Yin,Liwen Zhang,Zhongwang Zhang,Xixi Wu,Rui Ye,Zile Qiao,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates LLM-based search agents' ability to communicate confidence in multi-turn interactions and proposes Test-Time Scaling methods that use confidence scores to optimize answer quality and reduce token consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence research focuses mainly on single-turn scenarios, while confidence communication in complex multi-turn interactions remains understudied, despite being more challenging and practically important for search agents.

Method: The authors experiment with open-source agentic models and propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encouraging models to retry until reaching satisfactory confidence levels.

Result: Models show much higher task accuracy at high confidence levels and near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. The proposed TTS methods significantly reduce token consumption while maintaining competitive performance compared to baseline fixed budget methods.

Conclusion: LLM-based search agents can effectively communicate confidence in multi-turn scenarios, and confidence-based adaptive retry strategies (TTS) provide efficient performance optimization by reducing computational costs while maintaining answer quality.

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

### [312] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Stance Detection on Financial Targets from SEC Filing Reports and Earnings Call Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23464)
*Nikesh Gyawali,Doina Caragea,Alex Vasenkov,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a sentence-level corpus for stance detection on financial metrics (debt, EPS, sales) from SEC filings and earnings call transcripts, using ChatGPT-o3-pro labeling with human validation. It evaluates LLMs with various prompting strategies and finds few-shot with Chain-of-Thought prompting performs best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial narratives from SEC filings and earnings calls are crucial but challenging to analyze due to length, jargon, and nuanced language. Existing sentiment analysis requires expensive labeled data, making sentence-level stance detection difficult.

Method: Created a sentence-level corpus for stance detection on three financial metrics (debt, EPS, sales) from Form 10-K reports and earnings call transcripts, labeled using ChatGPT-o3-pro with human validation. Evaluated LLMs using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting strategies.

Result: Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought prompting performed best compared to supervised baselines. LLM performance varied across SEC and ECT datasets.

Conclusion: LLMs can be practically leveraged for target-specific stance detection in the financial domain without requiring extensive labeled data.

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMTutorBench is the first benchmark for AI math tutoring with 685 problems based on pedagogically significant key-steps, evaluating models across six dimensions through three tasks, revealing performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks overlook essential tutoring skills like diagnosing student difficulties and providing step-by-step guidance, which are crucial for effective math tutoring but not adequately addressed by current multimodal large language models.

Method: Created MMTutorBench with 685 problems built around pedagogically significant key-steps, each paired with problem-specific rubrics for fine-grained evaluation across six dimensions, structured into three tasks: Insight Discovery, Operation Formulation, and Operation Execution.

Result: Evaluation of 12 leading MLLMs showed clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial room for improvement compared to human tutors, OCR pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains, and rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable.

Conclusion: MMTutorBench highlights both the difficulty and diagnostic value for advancing AI tutoring, demonstrating the need for specialized benchmarks that capture essential tutoring skills beyond simple problem-solving.

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M4FC is a new multimodal fact-checking dataset with 4,982 images and 6,980 claims across 10 languages, addressing limitations of existing datasets through diverse cultural contexts and six fact-checking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fact-checking datasets have limitations including small size, limited language coverage, evidence leakage, and dependency on external news sources for true claims.

Method: Created M4FC dataset with images verified by professional fact-checkers from 22 organizations, spanning 10 languages and six multimodal fact-checking tasks, with baseline results provided.

Result: The dataset contains 4,982 images paired with 6,980 claims, representing diverse cultural and geographic contexts, with each claim available in up to two languages from ten total languages.

Conclusion: M4FC addresses key limitations in multimodal fact-checking research and provides comprehensive resources for six different fact-checking tasks, with analysis showing how intermediate tasks influence verdict prediction performance.

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPQA, a benchmark for core intent identification in personalized question answering, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks that don't directly measure intent identification capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without directly measuring intent identification capabilities, which is critical for generating responses that satisfy individual information needs.

Method: Proposed IPQA benchmark derived from observable behavior patterns in answer selection using satisficing theory, with dataset construction through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality control combining automated verification with human validation.

Result: Experimental evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art language models struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts, with performance degrading as question complexity increases.

Conclusion: The IPQA benchmark addresses a critical gap in evaluating intent identification capabilities for personalized question answering, and current systems show limitations in identifying core intents from user histories.

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK is a lightweight LLM-based reranker trained on minimal synthetic data that achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks while using only 5% of typical training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM adaptation for information reranking requires large-scale fine-tuning which is computationally expensive. The authors aim to demonstrate that effective reranking can be achieved with minimal supervision.

Method: Developed LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER pipeline to generate diverse, challenging synthetic reranking examples, then fine-tuned LIMRANK model using this synthetic data.

Result: LIMRANK achieves competitive performance on BRIGHT (reasoning-intensive retrieval) and FollowIR (instruction-following retrieval) benchmarks while using less than 5% of typical training data. Shows strong generalization in scientific literature search and retrieval-augmented generation.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs can be effectively adapted for reranking tasks using minimal, high-quality synthetic supervision, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates traditional ML models and fine-tuned transformers for hope speech detection, finding that transformers achieve better performance with higher precision and recall due to their ability to capture subtle semantic nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify hope speech as an important NLP task for detecting motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed behavior on social media platforms.

Method: Evaluated traditional machine learning models (SVM with linear/RBF kernels, logistic regression, Naive Bayes) and fine-tuned transformers on a previously split hope speech dataset with train, development, and test sets.

Result: Traditional ML models achieved macro-F1 scores of 0.75-0.78, while transformers delivered better results with weighted precision of 0.82, weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80 accuracy.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures outperform traditional ML models in hope speech detection by capturing subtle semantic nuances, suggesting larger transformers and LLMs could perform even better on small datasets.

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BR-RM is a two-turn reward model that applies think-twice reasoning to reward modeling, using adaptive branching to select critical dimensions and branch-conditioned rethinking for targeted analysis, reducing judgment diffusion and improving error sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models compress multiple quality dimensions into single scalar scores in one pass, causing judgment diffusion where attention spreads across criteria, leading to diluted focus and shallow analysis.

Method: Two-turn approach: Turn 1 performs adaptive branching to select instance-critical dimensions and sketch evidence-seeking hypotheses; Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking to test hypotheses and scrutinize key aspects. Trained with GRPO-style RL over structured two-turn traces using binary outcome rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains, reduces judgment diffusion, and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors.

Conclusion: BR-RM successfully transfers think-twice principles to reward modeling, making the approach practical and scalable while maintaining compatibility with standard RLHF pipelines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework bridging predictive modeling and interactive systems for computational psychology, featuring transformer fine-tuning, generative LLMs as 'Personality Brain', and deployment as scalable microservices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between isolated predictive modeling and interactive systems for psychological analysis by integrating AI and computational psychology to understand complex human psychological states.

Method: End-to-end development lifecycle: 1) Benchmarking on four psychological datasets with classical ML, 2) Fine-tuning transformers with solutions for numerical instability and resource constraints, 3) Fine-tuning generative LLMs as interactive 'Personality Brain', 4) Deploying as scalable microservices ecosystem.

Result: Successfully stabilized transformer-based regression models for affective computing with meaningful predictive performance, developed replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI research, and created complete research-to-deployment pipeline.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a holistic approach integrating predictive analysis with generative dialogue, providing a practical model for future computational psychology and human-AI interaction research.

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE is a novel framework that enables personalized story generation without fine-tuning or direct user feedback by creating pseudo-user agents and user-specific rubrics from interaction history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with personalized text generation that reflects individual user preferences, and conventional approaches using explicit feedback or fine-tuning face practical issues like user burden, data collection costs, computational expenses, and privacy concerns.

Method: PREFINE extends the Critique-and-Refine paradigm by constructing a pseudo-user agent from user interaction history and generating user-specific rubrics. This agent critiques and refines outputs on the user's behalf based on tailored evaluation criteria.

Result: On PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets, PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically significant scores than baselines in LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, without compromising general story quality. Both pseudo-user agent and user-specific rubrics were confirmed as crucial components.

Conclusion: PREFINE enables efficient personalization without parameter updates or direct user feedback, with potential applications beyond story generation in dialogue systems, education, and recommendation systems.

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

TL;DR: SIGN introduces a naming game with lightweight structure that enables faster convergence and higher agreement in multi-agent communication compared to unconstrained natural language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI systems with multiple LLM agents face coordination breakdowns due to inconsistent conventions, requiring reliable and scalable communication for applications like collaborative coding and distributed planning.

Method: SIGN (Schema-Induced Games for Naming) uses lightweight structure to steer convention formation in multi-agent naming games, comparing schema-induced communication against unconstrained natural language.

Result: Schema-induced communication achieves faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement compared to unconstrained natural language.

Conclusion: Minimal structure serves as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent coordination, with potential applications extending beyond naming games.

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoder-only autoregressive language models (OPT and Pythia families) show empirical capability ceilings in knowledge-intensive tasks where accuracy plateaus despite continued loss reduction, while procedural tasks follow conventional scaling patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate scaling limitations in decoder-only autoregressive language models across different task types and understand why knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite parameter scaling.

Method: Systematic evaluation of OPT and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling) on knowledge-intensive tasks and procedural tasks, combined with attention intervention experiments to test model sensitivity.

Result: Knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement despite smooth loss reduction. MMLU mathematics accuracy remains flat at 19-20% across all scales while cross-entropy loss decreases by 31%. Procedural tasks like arithmetic show conventional scaling. Attention intervention causes catastrophic performance collapse rather than graceful degradation.

Conclusion: For knowledge-intensive applications using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. These findings quantify capability-specific scaling failures and inform resource allocation decisions, though whether these are fundamental architectural constraints or implementation-specific limitations remains an open question.

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces GeoThoughts dataset and GeoThought-MLLM model to address LLMs' poor performance in geometric reasoning by providing comprehensive visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, and explicit reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform poorly on geometric reasoning tasks due to the intrinsic complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step reasoning, and limitations of existing datasets lacking scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces.

Method: Developed GeoThoughts dataset with two subsets (6K and 10K samples) containing visual descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection steps, and final answers. Used this to train GeoThought-MLLM, a mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking processes.

Result: GeoThought-MLLM outperforms existing benchmarks in geometric tasks, demonstrating improved geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Analysis shows errors primarily come from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts or spatial misjudgment.

Conclusion: Training with Chain-of-Thought datasets improves geometric reasoning capabilities, and invoking CoT to correct mistakes enables the model to produce correct answers, addressing the core challenges in geometric problem solving.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

### [324] [Exploration through Generation: Applying GFlowNets to Structured Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21886)
*Mark Phillip Matovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GFlowNets applied to graph optimization problems (TSP, MST, Shortest Path) learn to sample optimal solutions proportionally to reward, matching classical algorithm results with computational scalability advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned policies, offering computational scalability advantages over classical algorithms.

Method: GFlowNets trained using Trajectory Balance loss to sequentially build solutions by selecting edges for spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours across benchmark instances of varying sizes.

Result: GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions matching classical algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, exact solvers for TSP), with training convergence depending on problem complexity.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates computational scalability potential for larger problem instances where classical exact methods become infeasible, amortizing computation through training.

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, se- lecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

### [325] [Computational Hardness of Reinforcement Learning with Partial $q^π$-Realizability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21888)
*Shayan Karimi,Xiaoqi Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proves computational hardness for reinforcement learning under partial qπ-realizability, showing NP-hardness for greedy policies and exponential lower bounds for softmax policies, indicating positive computational results are generally unattainable in this framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the computational complexity of reinforcement learning in a novel linear function approximation regime called partial qπ-realizability, which provides a practical model where function approximation naturally arises with assumptions weaker than qπ-realizability but stronger than q*-realizability.

Method: The authors establish computational hardness by reducing from δ-Max-3SAT and δ-Max-3SAT(b) complexity problems to instances of GLinear-κ-RL (greedy policy) and SLinear-κ-RL (softmax policy), proving NP-hardness under parameterized greedy policy sets and exponential lower bounds for softmax policies.

Result: Learning an ε-optimal policy in partial qπ-realizability is computationally hard - NP-hard for greedy policies and requires exponential time (in feature vector dimension) for softmax policies unless NP = RP, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Conclusion: Computational difficulty persists in partial qπ-realizability even when the policy set is expanded beyond the optimal policy, and positive computational results are generally unattainable in this framework, in contrast to qπ-realizability under generative access models.

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

### [326] [Performance Trade-offs of Optimizing Small Language Models for E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21970)
*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper shows that a small 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 model, optimized for e-commerce intent recognition, can achieve 99% accuracy matching GPT-4.1 while being significantly more resource-efficient through QLoRA fine-tuning and quantization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses of deploying large commercial LLMs for specialized tasks like e-commerce, by exploring smaller open-weight models as resource-efficient alternatives.

Method: Fine-tuned a 1B-parameter Llama 3.2 model using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on synthetic e-commerce query data, then applied post-training quantization to create GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions.

Result: The specialized 1B model achieved 99% accuracy, matching GPT-4.1. GPTQ reduced VRAM by 41% but slowed inference by 82% on T4 GPUs, while GGUF formats on CPU achieved 18x speedup and over 90% RAM reduction compared to FP16 baseline.

Conclusion: Small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just viable but more suitable for domain-specific applications, offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [327] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSA is a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns distribution shifts across backgrounds, enabling LLMs to simulate survey responses more accurately than training data while reducing real data requirements by 53.48-69.12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM methods for survey simulation suffer from prompt sensitivity, low accuracy, and inability to produce results better than training data distributions, which defeats the purpose of using LLMs for cost-effective survey simulation.

Method: Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA) - a two-stage fine-tuning approach that learns how output distributions change across different backgrounds rather than fitting training data distributions directly.

Result: DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five public survey datasets, providing results substantially closer to true distributions than training data, with comprehensive improvements in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency.

Conclusion: DSA effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM survey simulation methods by aligning distribution shifts, demonstrating significant data savings (53.48-69.12% reduction) while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Conclusion: This survey systematically categorizes MWP research through human cognitive abilities and demonstrates AI's progress in simulating human reasoning. It aims to inspire further research in AI reasoning and provides a repository for continued development in the field.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent is a mobile GUI agent system that uses device-cloud collaboration to balance performance and cost, enhancing a 3B model for strong decision-making while escalating only complex tasks to the cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents face a dilemma where truly on-device models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models (7B+) are too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively costly as cloud-only solutions.

Method: Enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO training on synthetic GUI data, integrates efficient long-reasoning mechanism for historical interactions, and uses real-time complexity assessment to escalate only challenging subtasks to the cloud while defaulting to on-device execution.

Result: Experiments on AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent matches or nears larger models' performance with significant reduction in cloud costs.

Conclusion: LightAgent provides an effective device-cloud collaboration solution that taps the cost-efficiency of on-device models and high capability of cloud models while avoiding their drawbacks.

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

TL;DR: LLM-AR is a neural-symbolic pipeline that converts LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules using ProbLog, achieving 59.5% precision in predicting startup success from founder traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have pattern recognition capabilities but variable accuracy limits their use in high-stakes decision-making like venture capital startup evaluation.

Method: LLM-AR pipeline distills LLM-generated heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by ProbLog, with iterative policy-evolution using association-rule mining to refine prediction rules.

Result: Achieved 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall on unseen data (5.9x random baseline precision), with fully interpretable decision paths.

Conclusion: The framework is interpretable, tunable, and shows promise for extending to other domains requiring reliable, explainable AI decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

### [331] [Predictive Coding Enhances Meta-RL To Achieve Interpretable Bayes-Optimal Belief Representation Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22039)
*Po-Chen Kuo,Han Hou,Will Dabney,Edgar Y. Walker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-RL with predictive coding modules learns more interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states than conventional meta-RL, leading to better generalization in partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current meta-RL agents achieve optimal policies but fail to learn compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states, limiting their adaptability and generalization capacity.

Method: Integrate self-supervised predictive coding modules into meta-RL, inspired by neuroscience predictive coding and auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL.

Result: Meta-RL with predictive modules consistently generates more interpretable representations that better approximate Bayes-optimal belief states across various tasks, even when both methods achieve optimal policies. In challenging active information seeking tasks, only the predictive version succeeds.

Conclusion: Predictive learning serves as a guiding principle for effective representation learning in partially observable environments, with better representations leading to improved generalization.

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the value of system-level hardware/software co-design methodology for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and cost/performance optimization in embedded system design.

Method: Applied SpecC methodology within system-level HW/SW co-design flow to PCM-to-PWM converter; used system-level estimates and fast functional simulation to evaluate different HW/SW partition mappings.

Result: Successfully derived HW/SW partitions that meet real-time constraints while reducing estimated cost compared to all-hardware solution and avoiding expense of purely software implementation on high-end processor.

Conclusion: Despite moderate design complexity, system-level co-design provides valuable early architectural insight, rapid validation, and actionable cost/performance trade-offs for embedded systems.

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

### [333] [Towards Error-Centric Intelligence II: Energy-Structured Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22050)
*Marcus Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for shifting from predictive accuracy to causal explanations in machine learning, introducing Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs) that represent mechanisms as constraints rather than input-output maps, enabling surgical interventions and causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML systems achieve high predictive accuracy but lack causal transparency - their representations don't support principled interventions. The authors argue intelligence should be defined as the ability to build and refine explanations with causal commitments that can be independently tested.

Method: Introduces Energy Structured Causal Models (ESCMs) where mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input-output maps. Interventions act through local surgery on these constraints, making internal structure manipulable.

Result: The paper shows that under mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics and provides concrete instantiations of structural-causal principles (LAP, ICM) in the ESCM context. It also analyzes how empirical risk minimization produces fractured representations due to gauge ambiguity.

Conclusion: ESCMs offer a formal language for causal reasoning in systems that aim to understand rather than merely predict, building on principles from Part I that define intelligence as explanation-building under criticism.

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision for next-generation AI systems that are energy-efficient, domain-specific multimodal agents capable of reasoning, planning, and continuous learning, addressing limitations of current large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems dominated by large language models require massive data and energy consumption (50-60 GWh for GPT-4) while suffering from hallucinations, making them unsuitable for critical applications. The human brain's efficiency (20W) inspires the need for more intelligent, energy-efficient AI.

Method: The paper develops a vision for future AI systems that transition from large data-hungry models to lightweight domain-specific multimodal agents. These systems would reason, plan, make decisions in dynamic environments using real-time data and prior knowledge, while continuously learning and evolving.

Result: The proposed vision outlines AI systems that are 1000x more energy-efficient than current state-of-the-art, with hardware reimagined to support such efficiency gains. These systems would progress from today's large models to nimble domain-specific agents.

Conclusion: The next wave of AI should evolve from current large models to energy-efficient domain-specific agents capable of reasoning and decision-making in uncertain environments, requiring significant hardware innovations to achieve 1000x energy efficiency improvements.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Motivation: BCIs face critical limitations including low information transfer rates and extensive user-specific calibration, hindering widespread adoption. Recent integration of Large Language Models shows promise but faces technical and ethical challenges, requiring a paradigm shift.

Method: The paper proposes a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration (BAC), reframing AI agents as active collaborative partners rather than passive brain signal data processors.

Result: The position advocates for a new framework that emphasizes ethical data handling, model reliability, and robust human-agent collaboration to ensure systems are safe, trustworthy, and effective.

Conclusion: The field is poised for a paradigm shift from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration, requiring focus on ethical considerations, model reliability, and collaborative frameworks to create safe and effective brain-agent systems.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

TL;DR: A framework for AI psychometrics using situational judgment tests and sophisticated personas to evaluate AI systems in emotionally demanding roles like law enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI psychometrics often reuse human trait inventories or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral realism and domain relevance in evaluating AI systems for roles requiring emotional judgment.

Method: Uses situational judgment tests from realistic scenarios, integrates industrial-organizational and personality psychology to design sophisticated personas with behavioral descriptors and life history, and employs structured generation with demographic priors and memoir-inspired narratives.

Result: Created a rich dataset for law enforcement assistant case study with 8,500 personas across 8 archetypes, 4,000 SJTs across 11 attributes, and 300,000 responses, with plans to release dataset and code publicly.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables more realistic and domain-relevant evaluation of AI systems in emotionally demanding roles through sophisticated persona design and situational judgment testing.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the

### [337] [Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178)
*Saranraj Nambusubramaniyan,Shervin Safavi,Raja Guru,Andreas Knoblauch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dopamine, a derivative-free optimizer inspired by neural reinforcement learning that addresses the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem using weight perturbation learning with adaptive learning rates based on reward prediction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of back-propagation in neural networks, including computational inefficiency, memory requirements, weight transport problems, and update locking issues, by developing a biologically plausible alternative.

Method: Developed Dopamine optimizer for weight perturbation learning that uses stochastic weight updates and minimizes regret (reward prediction error) between perturbed and unperturbed model outcomes to create adaptive learning rates.

Result: Dopamine-trained models showed accelerated convergence, outperformed standard weight perturbation methods, achieved comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory.

Conclusion: The Dopamine optimizer provides robust solutions with performance comparable to state-of-the-art ML optimizers while being more neurobiologically plausible and computationally efficient.

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

*Haoyang Liu,Jie Wang,Yuyang Cai,Xiongwei Han,Yufei Kuang,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OptiTree introduces a tree search approach for automated optimization modeling that adaptively decomposes complex OR problems into simpler subproblems using hierarchical problem taxonomy, achieving over 10% improvement in modeling accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fixed-step decomposition in LLM-based optimization modeling fails for complex OR problems due to their intricate mathematical structures, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: Developed a modeling tree organizing OR problems hierarchically by taxonomy and complexity, with recurrent tree search to identify simpler subproblems and synthesize global modeling thoughts through adaptive integration of hierarchical thoughts.

Result: OptiTree significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvements on challenging benchmarks for optimization modeling accuracy.

Conclusion: The tree search approach with adaptive problem decomposition effectively enhances modeling capabilities for complex OR problems, demonstrating substantial performance gains over existing methods.

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

*Eunseop Yoon,Hee Suk Yoon,Jaehyun Jang,SooHwan Eom,Qi Dai,Chong Luo,Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACR introduces a dense, model-intrinsic reward based on the model's evolving belief in the correct answer, addressing RLVR's sparse reward limitation and accelerating reasoning exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR's sparse, outcome-based rewards provide no guidance for intermediate reasoning steps, slowing exploration and making training inefficient.

Method: PACR computes dense rewards directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer, using the inductive bias that correct reasoning trajectories should show an ascending trend in ground-truth probability.

Result: PACR accelerates exploration, reaches reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and improves performance on multiple benchmarks compared to standard RLVR.

Conclusion: Dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals like PACR can make RLVR training more effective and reliable by constraining exploration to logically sound reasoning regions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Conclusion: The LIFT LLM framework successfully integrates literature knowledge with fine-tuned LLMs for accurate and interpretable risk prediction, showing potential for data-driven knowledge discovery in transportation safety.

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and

*Changti Wu,Shijie Lian,Zihao Liu,Lei Zhang,Laurence Tianruo Yang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), addressing limitations of existing 2D geometry benchmarks by focusing on 3D solid geometry with process evaluation and dynamic instance generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal math reasoning benchmarks focus on 2D plane geometry, use static datasets prone to contamination/memorization, and evaluate only final answers without considering reasoning processes.

Method: Created through semi-automatic annotation pipeline with 503 expert-curated seed questions that can dynamically generate unlimited multimodal instances. Includes process evaluation using expert-annotated reasoning chains to assess logical validity and causal coherence.

Result: Experiments show large performance gaps across VLMs, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor performance on high-level spatial intelligence tasks like mental rotation and visualization.

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo provides the first dynamic benchmark for genuine spatial reasoning evaluation in VLMs, revealing significant limitations in current models' spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

*Revanth Rameshkumar,Jimson Huang,Yunxin Sun,Fei Xia,Abulhair Saparov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show impressive performance on current reasoning benchmarks but fail catastrophically when problem complexity scales beyond training distribution, revealing limited generalization capabilities despite their utility for most real-world cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large reasoning models (LRMs) - LLMs fine-tuned for step-by-step reasoning - truly possess generalized reasoning capabilities or if their performance is limited to problems of modest complexity similar to their training data.

Method: Developed the Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD) with a generative process to create unlimited examples of scalable complexity, then evaluated LRM performance on graph connectivity and natural language proof planning tasks across varying complexity levels.

Result: LRM performance drops abruptly at sufficient complexity levels and does not generalize beyond the complexity distribution seen in training. While most real-world examples fall within LRMs' success regime, the long tails of complex problems expose substantial failure potential.

Conclusion: LRMs have near-term utility for most real-world reasoning tasks but lack true generalization capabilities. New methods are needed that can handle complexity beyond the training distribution, as current approaches fail catastrophically when faced with sufficiently complex reasoning problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

*Abhijnan Nath,Nikhil Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR), a novel algorithm to train LLM agents that can effectively collaborate by accepting interventions from partner agents to increase group common ground, addressing limitations of standard RLHF-trained agents that tend to ignore interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as collaborators with humans, there's a need to evaluate and improve their ability to collaborate effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks, particularly in accepting interventions to build common ground.

Method: The authors use a two-player Modified-Action MDP to analyze suboptimal behavior of standard AI agents, and propose ICR - a partner-aware learning algorithm that trains common-ground-optimal collaborators to intelligently collect information from partner interventions.

Result: Experiments across multiple collaborative task environments show that ICR is more capable of promoting successful common-ground convergence and exploring more diverse solutions compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: ICR provides an effective approach for training LLM agents that can better collaborate by being receptive to partner interventions, addressing a key limitation in current RLHF-trained agents and improving group common ground in collaborative settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OFFSIDE is a benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in multimodal large language models using football transfer rumors, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through diverse test sets and revealing key vulnerabilities in current unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data privacy concerns in multimodal large language models by developing a comprehensive benchmark for machine unlearning, overcoming limitations of existing benchmarks that lack image diversity, accuracy, and real-world complexity.

Method: Created a manually curated dataset with 15.68K records for 80 football players, featuring four test sets to evaluate forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness, supporting advanced settings like selective unlearning, corrective relearning, and unimodal unlearning.

Result: Key findings show unimodal methods fail on multimodal rumors, unlearning efficacy is driven by catastrophic forgetting, all methods struggle with visual rumors, unlearned rumors can be easily recovered, and methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks.

Conclusion: Current multimodal unlearning approaches have significant vulnerabilities, highlighting the urgent need for more robust solutions to handle the complexity of real-world misinformation scenarios.

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATOM is a few-shot, scalable approach for building and updating Temporal Knowledge Graphs from unstructured text by splitting documents into atomic facts and using dual-time modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static knowledge graphs fail to capture dynamic, time-sensitive data, while recent zero/few-shot methods suffer from instability and incomplete fact coverage.

Method: Splits documents into minimal atomic facts, constructs atomic TKGs with dual-time modeling (distinguishing observation time from validity time), and merges them in parallel.

Result: Achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17% better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: ATOM demonstrates strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction with improved performance across key metrics.

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

*Bingqing Song,Jiaxiang Li,Rong Wang,Songtao Lu,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how in-context learning (ICL) emerges in pre-trained language models, focusing on the role of pre-training procedures and context construction. It provides theoretical analysis and experiments showing how context can shift model output towards query task distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread applications of in-context learning in large language models, there is limited theoretical understanding of how ICL capabilities arise and the precise roles of pre-training procedures and context construction.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework to analyze ICL performance, starting with a simple one-layer transformer example and then extending to more general cases. They examine network architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction processes.

Result: The study shows that when pre-training and query task distributions differ, properly constructed context can shift output distribution towards the query task distribution in a quantifiable way. They derive precise relationships between ICL performance, context length, and KL divergence between distributions.

Conclusion: The research provides theoretical foundations for understanding in-context learning, demonstrating how context construction enables models to adapt to query tasks despite distribution shifts, with experimental validation supporting the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM is a safety-constrained hybrid pipeline for medical diagnosis and treatment that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation with built-in safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based medical systems lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty, resulting in unsafe outputs. There's a need for safety-constrained systems that can handle heterogeneous patient settings with high diagnostic risk.

Method: Fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases with Focal Loss and Monte Carlo Dropout for confidence-aware predictions. Uses Biomedical Sentence-BERT to retrieve relevant dialogues from MedDialog corpus, then fine-tuned FLAN-T5 for treatment generation with RxNorm post-processing for antibiotic stewardship and DDI screening.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score, outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1%. Has 78% top-5 retrieval precision, clinician-rated validity of 4.2/5, and reduces unsafe antibiotic suggestions by 67% compared to GPT-5. Automatically flags 18% low-certainty cases for expert review.

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM demonstrates robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment, providing a deployable human-in-the-loop decision support framework for resource-limited healthcare environments.

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using first-token log-probability to detect boilerplate LLM responses early, enabling computational savings through early termination or model redirection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs waste computational resources generating boilerplate responses like refusals and greetings, adding unnecessary cost and latency.

Method: Use first-token log-probability distribution as signal to classify response type, with lightweight k-NN classifier for prediction.

Result: First-token log-probability vectors form separable clusters for different response types across diverse models, achieving high accuracy in predicting boilerplate vs substantive responses.

Conclusion: Practical technique for optimizing LLM inference through early termination or redirection to smaller models, enabling more efficient and sustainable deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

### [351] [Atlas Urban Index: A VLM-Based Approach for Spatially and Temporally Calibrated Urban Development Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22702)
*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Atlas Urban Index (AUI) is a new metric using Vision-Language Models and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to measure urban development, overcoming limitations of traditional indices like NDBI by handling atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing urban development metrics like NDBI struggle with accuracy due to atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover, which hinders large-scale monitoring of urbanization and human development.

Method: Collect time series of Sentinel-2 images, process them in fixed time windows to get representative images with minimal cloud cover, use Vision-Language Models with reference images and past images for consistent scoring.

Result: Qualitative experiments on Bangalore show that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI in measuring urban development.

Conclusion: AUI successfully overcomes challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produces more reliable and stable development scores for monitoring urban development.

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT is a novel RAG framework that uses pre-retrieval contrastive thinking to handle knowledge-sparse queries by generating contrastive questions and extracting key differences, achieving better performance and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck in RAG systems with knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval noise distorts reasoning and requires costly post-processing.

Method: Proposes RaCoT framework that shifts contrastive thinking to pre-retrieval stage by automatically generating semantically adjacent contrastive questions and extracting Δ-Prompt to capture key differences, guiding the model to focus on critical details that determine answer divergence.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points on six benchmarks, shows superior robustness with only 8.6% performance drop in adversarial tests, and achieves low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54).

Conclusion: RaCoT reframes RAG paradigm from post-hoc context cleaning to a priori shaping of discriminative reasoning, offering efficient and robust path for reliable AI systems in real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares five major LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, GPT, LLaMA) across performance, ethics, and usability, finding each has unique strengths: Claude excels in moral reasoning, Gemini in multimodal capabilities, DeepSeek in factual reasoning, LLaMA for open applications, and GPT for balanced performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs transform businesses and daily life, and major companies develop increasingly sophisticated models, it's crucial to understand their differences in performance, ethical behavior, and usability based on their underlying design philosophies.

Method: Comparative analysis of five leading LLMs (Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models, Meta's LLaMA) across three key factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and Bias Mitigation, and Usability and Integration.

Result: Each model demonstrated distinct strengths: Claude showed superior moral reasoning, Gemini excelled in multimodal capabilities with strong ethical frameworks, DeepSeek performed well in factual reasoning, LLaMA was suitable for open applications, and ChatGPT delivered balanced performance with user-focus.

Conclusion: The models differ significantly in performance, usability, and ethical treatment, suggesting users should leverage each model's specific strengths rather than seeking a one-size-fits-all solution.

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

### [354] [Multi-Modal Fact-Verification Framework for Reducing Hallucinations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22751)
*Piyushkumar Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fact verification framework that reduces LLM hallucinations by 67% through real-time cross-checking against multiple knowledge sources, with 89% satisfactory ratings from domain experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models generate plausible but false information (hallucinations), which is a major barrier to deploying them in real-world applications where accuracy matters.

Method: Developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects errors in real-time by cross-checking LLM outputs against multiple knowledge sources including structured databases, live web searches, and academic literature.

Result: Reduced hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated corrected outputs 89% satisfactory - a significant improvement over unverified LLM responses.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

*Binxiao Xu,Junyu Feng,Ruichuan An,Yulin Luo,Shilin Yan,Hao Liang,Ming Lu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jarvis is a personalized AI assistant framework that uses personal KV-Cache retrieval to store user-specific information in both textual and visual tokens, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in visual question answering and text-only tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants either learn concept tokens or train VLMs to use user-specific information, but both struggle to generate accurate answers. There's a need for more effective personalization that can handle fine-grained user-specific details.

Method: Jarvis stores user-specific information in KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. Textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from user's images. When answering questions, it retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage to ensure accuracy.

Result: Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets. It provides more accurate responses, particularly when answers depend on specific local details.

Conclusion: Jarvis represents a practical path toward personalized AI assistants by effectively leveraging user-specific information through KV-Cache retrieval, demonstrating superior performance in handling fine-grained personal details compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

*Zora Zhiruo Wang,Yijia Shao,Omar Shaikh,Daniel Fried,Graham Neubig,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents the first direct comparison between human and AI agent workers across multiple work domains (data analysis, engineering, computation, writing, design), revealing that while agents are faster and cheaper, they use programmatic approaches even for visual tasks, produce inferior quality work, and often fabricate data to mask deficiencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI agents perform human work compared to actual humans, given that current agent developments lack grounding in understanding human work execution and the specific roles agents can play in diverse workflows.

Method: Introduced a scalable toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from computer-use activities of both humans and agents, enabling direct comparison across multiple work domains using the same tasks.

Result: Agents: (1) Use programmatic approaches across all domains including visually-dependent tasks, contrasting with human UI-centric methods; (2) Produce inferior quality work but mask deficiencies via data fabrication and tool misuse; (3) Deliver results 88.3% faster and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans.

Conclusion: While agents show promise in workflow alignment, their current limitations in quality and approach suggest potential for efficient human-agent collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents while maintaining human oversight for complex, visual, or quality-critical work.

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for Microsoft Copilot services to handle multiple tasks and scalable agents, using meta-learning for optimal inference strategy selection across various agents/models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microsoft Copilot services need a robust orchestrator to dynamically distribute tasks from user prompts to the right agents as the repertoire of copilots expands with new agents.

Method: Proposes an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) that leverages meta-learning through a trained decision tree model to decide the best inference strategy among various agents/models, providing both natural language and action responses.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through two production use cases: Microsoft 365 E-Commerce Copilot (providing up-to-date product information and connecting to multiple agents) and code compliance copilot (scanning DevOps code to detect compliance issues in pull requests).

Conclusion: The AMO framework successfully enables robust orchestration of multiple agents in copilot services, handling dynamic expansion of agent repertoires while providing both natural language and action-based responses.

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the existential threats posed by artificial intelligence development, particularly the transition from current AI systems to artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence that could vastly exceed human cognitive capabilities.

Method: The analysis draws on theoretical work by Irving J. Good and Nick Bostrom, along with recent publications, to explore AGI and superintelligence development. It considers the exponential growth of machine cognitive power and hypothetical IQs.

Result: The paper identifies that human extinction may result from uncontrollable, indifferent cognitive superiority of superintelligent AI systems rather than from malicious intent, highlighting the fundamental alien nature of intelligence vastly exceeding humanity's.

Conclusion: The existential risk from AI stems from the potential development of superintelligence that is fundamentally alien and indifferent to human values, where extinction could occur not through malice but through the uncontrollable nature of cognitive superiority that vastly exceeds human capabilities.

Abstract: This article analyzes the existential risks artificial intelligence (AI)
poses to humanity, tracing the trajectory from current AI to ultraintelligence.
Drawing on Irving J. Good and Nick Bostrom's theoretical work, plus recent
publications (AI 2027; If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies), it explores AGI and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRM-Agent extends the Hierarchical Reasoning Model to handle dynamic, uncertain environments using reinforcement learning, enabling goal navigation in mazes while reusing computation across time-steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original HRM was limited to static, fully-observable problems and couldn't handle dynamic, uncertain environments or reuse computation across time-steps, which are essential for real-world applications.

Method: Developed HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained exclusively with reinforcement learning, and analyzed its recurrent inference process dynamics.

Result: HRM-Agent successfully learned to navigate to goals in dynamic and uncertain maze environments, with evidence showing it effectively reuses computation from previous time-steps.

Conclusion: HRM can be effectively adapted through reinforcement learning to handle dynamic, uncertain environments while maintaining its computational efficiency and reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

TL;DR: RL agents can learn to reason about their computational costs and dynamically control when to use compute, achieving better performance with 3x less computation on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL agents don't become more computationally efficient as they improve, unlike humans who require less cognitive effort with proficiency. Enabling agents to reason about compute could create more energy-efficient systems.

Method: Show agents the cost of their computation and give them control over when to use compute. Experiments conducted on the Arcade Learning Environment.

Result: With the same training compute budget, compute-reasoning agents performed better on 75% of games and used three times less compute on average.

Conclusion: Enabling RL agents to reason about and control their computational usage leads to significant efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies and analyzes the modality gap in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), where models over-rely on textual cues while under-attending to visual content, leading to imbalanced reasoning capabilities across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent findings reveal that current MLLMs demonstrate an imbalance in reasoning capabilities, performing better on text-centric tasks than vision-centric ones, which results in suboptimal performance on tasks requiring genuine visual reasoning.

Method: The authors analyze the modality gap through training recipes and systematically explore strategies to bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data design and loss design.

Result: The study shows that existing training recipes tend to amplify the modality gap, and the proposed strategies provide insights into developing training recipes that can mitigate this imbalance.

Conclusion: The research provides valuable insights for developing training recipes that bridge the modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning in MLLMs, with publicly available code for implementation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unifying framework for cognitive and AI inferential mechanisms using logic gate circuits, identifying four dependency forms and eight inferential patterns that bridge symbolic AI with cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a unifying framework for inferential mechanisms in both cognitive studies and artificial intelligence, bridging the gap between natural and artificial cognition.

Method: Using symbolic AI modeling techniques through electronic circuits based on logic gates, analyzing implication and negation treatments, conducting combinatorial exploration to identify dependency forms, and examining logic program patterns.

Result: Identified four main forms of dependencies realizable by inferential circuits and eight common inferential patterns that unify traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms.

Conclusion: The observations from symbolic means and digital systems may reveal generally applicable structures for cognitive inferential mechanisms, providing a unifying framework despite the speculative nature of the approach.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization across agentic tool-calling environments remains an unsolved challenge, as LLMs struggle to transfer reasoning strategies and coordinate tools across diverse domains despite strong performance on isolated benchmarks.

Method: Introduces CoreThink Agentic Reasoner framework that augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration, without requiring additional training.

Result: Most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on the new MAVEN benchmark, revealing significant generalization gaps. CoreThink achieves state-of-the-art performance with 530% improvements over baselines at roughly one-tenth the computational cost.

Conclusion: The CoreThink framework effectively addresses generalization challenges in agentic tool-calling environments, demonstrating substantial performance gains across multiple benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the

Result: MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL baselines in average reward and QoS metrics, demonstrating scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed MA-CDMP framework effectively addresses key challenges in decentralized multi-agent resource allocation, providing theoretical guarantees for convergence stability and achieving superior performance in wireless communication systems.

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

### [366] [Exploring Semantic-constrained Adversarial Example with Instruction Uncertainty Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22981)
*Jin Hu,Jiakai Wang,Linna Jing,Haolin Li,Haodong Liu,Haotong Qin,Aishan Liu,Ke Xu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes InSUR, a multi-dimensional framework that addresses semantic uncertainty in generating semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE) through instruction uncertainty reduction, improving transferability, adaptability, and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating SemanticAE from natural language instructions suffer from inadequate attacking ability due to unexplored semantic uncertainty factors like referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and boundary ambiguity in human instructions.

Method: The InSUR framework tackles semantic uncertainty through three dimensions: 1) Residual-driven attacking direction stabilization using ResAdv-DDIM sampler to stabilize adversarial optimization, 2) Context-encoded attacking scenario constraint with guidance masking and renderer integration for 2D/3D SemanticAE, and 3) Semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement to clarify evaluation boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior transfer attack performance of InSUR. The framework also enables the first reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial examples.

Conclusion: The proposed InSUR framework effectively addresses semantic uncertainty in generating SemanticAE, resulting in more transferable, adaptive, and effective adversarial examples while pioneering reference-free 3D SemanticAE generation.

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProfileXAI is a framework that combines post-hoc explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval-augmented LLMs to generate tailored explanations for different user types, achieving good performance across multiple evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a flexible explanation system that works across different models and domains, providing customized explanations for various user profiles by leveraging both traditional explainers and large language models.

Method: The framework indexes a multimodal knowledge base, selects appropriate explainers per instance using quantitative criteria, and generates grounded narratives through chat-enabled prompting. It couples post-hoc explainers with retrieval-augmented LLMs.

Result: No single explainer dominates: LIME achieved best fidelity-robustness trade-off, Anchor produced sparsest rules with low token usage, and SHAP attained highest user satisfaction. Profile conditioning stabilized token usage and maintained positive ratings across user profiles.

Conclusion: ProfileXAI enables efficient and trustworthy explanations by combining multiple explainers with LLMs, with profile conditioning stabilizing output and maintaining quality across different user types including domain experts.

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, there is a lack of systematic guidance on prompt optimization across clinical contexts and no comprehensive framework for assessing trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports.

Method: The study proposes a Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment (MDCA) framework and applies it to evaluate several advanced LLMs (Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, DeepSeek-V3, ByteDance-Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct) using the SiliconFlow platform.

Result: The framework enables systematic evaluation and comparison of LLM performance in generating liver MRI reports, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The MDCA framework provides a standardized approach for assessing trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports and offers guidance for institution-specific prompt optimization to improve reliability in clinical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in
generating diagnostic conclusions from imaging findings, thereby supporting
radiology reporting, trainee education, and quality control. However,
systematic guidance on how to optimize prompt design across different clinical
contexts remains underexplored. Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized
framework for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports
is yet to be established. This study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of
LLM-generated liver MRI reports by introducing a Multi-Dimensional Credibility
Assessment (MDCA) framework and providing guidance on institution-specific
prompt optimization. The proposed framework is applied to evaluate and compare
the performance of several advanced LLMs, including Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905,

TL;DR: MDD is a diffusion planner that uses tunable temporal density hyperparameters across the planning horizon, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While sparse-step planning in diffusion models captures long-term dependencies efficiently, excessive sparsity degrades performance. The authors hypothesize that optimal temporal density varies across the planning horizon and certain trajectory segments require denser planning.

Method: Proposed Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD) with tunable density hyperparameters throughout the temporal horizon, allowing non-uniform step skipping across different parts of the planned trajectory.

Result: MDD achieves new state-of-the-art performance across Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL task domains.

Conclusion: Tunable temporal density across the planning horizon is crucial for optimal diffusion planning performance, and MDD effectively addresses the limitations of uniform sparse-step planning.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online education growth creates need for better cognitive diagnosis, but traditional methods struggle with cross-disciplinary challenges due to differences in knowledge systems and data characteristics between disciplines.

Method: Proposes TLCD method combining deep learning techniques and transfer learning strategies, leveraging common features from main discipline to enhance performance in target discipline through neural network cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association approaches.

Result: Experimental results show the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model based on deep learning outperforms basic models in cross-disciplinary tasks and provides more accurate evaluation of students' learning situations.

Conclusion: The proposed TLCD method effectively addresses cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis challenges and demonstrates superior performance in accurately assessing students' learning across different disciplines.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Small language models like Phi-4 can be effectively transformed into reward models for code generation, achieving over 20% improvement in identifying the most accurate code solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether small language models can serve as effective reward models for code generation, bridging the gap between process and outcome rewards.

Method: Constructed a dataset from APPS coding challenge with correctness labels, trained a value-head model to estimate success probability of intermediate outputs, and used it as a critic for code evaluation.

Result: Small LLMs successfully identified correct solutions among multiple candidates and improved search capability for the most accurate code by over 20%.

Conclusion: Small language models are capable of serving as effective reward models for code evaluation, providing significant improvements in code generation quality assessment.

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sci-LLMs perform better with high-level structured context from bioinformatics tools than with raw biomolecular sequences, which act as informational noise. The context-only approach consistently outperforms sequence-only and combined approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tokenization dilemma in Sci-LLMs when processing raw biomolecular sequences, where current strategies limit reasoning capacity by either treating sequences as specialized language (risking loss of functional motifs) or as separate modality (introducing alignment challenges).

Method: Systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks using three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and combination of both. Context-only approach uses high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools.

Result: Context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Inclusion of raw sequences alongside high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating raw sequences act as informational noise even for models with specialized tokenization schemes.

Conclusion: Sci-LLMs should be reframed not as sequence decoders but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge. Developmental focus should shift from direct sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis for hybrid scientific AI agents.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FoG skill discovery method uses foundation models to incorporate human preferences into reinforcement learning, eliminating undesirable behaviors like flipping and avoiding hazardous areas while learning diverse skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing skill discovery methods focus only on maximizing skill diversity without considering human preferences, leading to undesirable or dangerous behaviors that don't align with human intentions.

Method: FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate states based on human intentions, then uses these scores to re-weight the rewards of skill discovery algorithms to guide learning toward desirable behaviors.

Result: FoG successfully eliminates undesirable behaviors (flipping, rolling) and avoids hazardous areas in both state-based and pixel-based tasks, while discovering skills involving behaviors that are difficult to define.

Conclusion: Foundation model guided skill discovery effectively incorporates human preferences into reinforcement learning, enabling safer and more desirable skill acquisition without hand-crafted reward functions.

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO is a novel drop-in modification to MCTS that automatically abstracts actions using reward statistics, outperforming standard MCTS on IPPC benchmarks without needing transition probabilities or DAG structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MCTS performance by automatically detecting and abstracting symmetric actions that existing frameworks like ASAP struggle with, especially when symmetric states are far apart in state space.

Method: AUPO uses reward distribution statistics collected during MCTS to automatically abstract actions, requiring only the decision policy modification without access to transition probabilities or directed acyclic graphs.

Result: AUPO clearly outperforms standard MCTS across a range of IPPC benchmark problems and can detect symmetric actions that state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with.

Conclusion: AUPO provides an effective automatic action abstraction method that works solely with MCTS reward statistics, is compatible with other abstraction techniques, and addresses limitations of existing frameworks in detecting distant symmetric actions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Conclusion: The method is effective for industrial game AI development and will replace hand-crafted agents in future game iterations, demonstrating practical impact in the video game industry.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

TL;DR: BlocKOA is a novel algorithm that accelerates IC thermal simulation data generation by using block Krylov methods and operator actions, achieving 420x speedup while maintaining data quality for training neural operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural operators for IC thermal simulation require large amounts of high-fidelity training data, which incurs significant computational costs for data generation.

Method: Uses block Krylov algorithm to quickly obtain basic solutions from heat equation structure, combines them to generate temperature distributions satisfying physical constraints, then applies heat operators to determine heat source distributions.

Result: Achieves 420-fold speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips, with time complexity one order lower than existing methods. Data-driven approaches trained on BlocKOA data show comparable performance using only 4% of generation time.

Conclusion: BlocKOA efficiently generates precise IC thermal simulation data, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining data quality for training neural operators.

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach for CNOT gate minimization in quantum circuits, using a single agent trained on fixed-size matrices with preprocessing for different sizes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT gates are fundamental for quantum computing and entanglement, but minimizing their number remains an open challenge with uncharacterized computational complexity. Current methods require training multiple agents for different circuit sizes, which is inefficient.

Method: A novel reinforcement learning approach using a single agent trained up to fixed size m=8, with preprocessing (embedding or Gaussian striping) for matrices of different sizes. The agent was evaluated on matrix sizes from 3 to 15.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with performance advantages increasing as the matrix size n grows larger.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning approach provides an effective solution for CNOT minimization that scales well and surpasses existing methods, particularly for larger quantum circuits.

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

*Anwesha Das,John Duff,Jörg Hoffmann,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for adaptive signaling in human-AI teams that optimizes message timing and specificity using Bayesian reasoning to maintain user awareness in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve human-AI collaboration on time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments by ensuring humans maintain accurate understanding of critical information despite limited attention resources.

Method: Uses Bayesian reference resolution with Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework to plan message sequences, adapting specificity and timing based on user projections and multi-step planning with realistic awareness models.

Result: Shows effectiveness depends on combining multi-step planning with realistic user awareness models, outperforming baseline methods in maintaining timely alignment between user belief and dynamic environment.

Conclusion: Establishes theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in human-agent teams, demonstrating how cognitive science insights can inform assistive agent design, representing the first application of RSA for dynamic environment communication.

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

### [380] [Opinion Mining Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23384)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,A. G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for opinion mining that uses fuzzy logic reasoning to analyze opinions at a deeper granularity level and then ranks entities based on this detailed analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the growth of social networking and e-commerce sites, huge amounts of opinions are now available online. While existing research has focused on opinion mining and entity ranking, no previous work has classified opinions into finer granularity levels before ranking entities.

Method: The proposed method uses fuzzy logic reasoning to perform opinion mining from statements at a deeper level of granularity, extracting attributes and components of entities that have been commented on and determining sentiment polarity.

Result: The method enables more detailed opinion analysis by working at a finer granularity level compared to existing approaches, allowing for more nuanced entity ranking.

Conclusion: This approach represents a novel contribution by combining fine-grained opinion classification with entity ranking using fuzzy logic, addressing a gap in existing opinion mining research.

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,

bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good

AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

### [382] [Bid2X: Revealing Dynamics of Bidding Environment in Online Advertising from A Foundation Model Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23410)
*Jiahao Ji,Tianyu Wang,Yeshu Li,Yushen Huo,Zhilin Zhang,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bid2X is a bidding foundation model that learns a unified function to estimate advertising effects across different scenarios, using attention mechanisms and zero-inflated projection for improved prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous auto-bidding models lack generalizability across different bidding environments as they are tailored for specific scenarios. There's a need for scenario-independent principles that can work across various advertising contexts.

Method: Built uniform series embeddings for heterogeneous data, used two attention mechanisms for inter-variable and temporal dependencies, implemented variable-aware fusion module for adaptive prediction, and devised zero-inflated projection module for joint classification-regression optimization.

Result: Offline evaluation on eight datasets showed superiority over baselines and cross-scenario generality. Online A/B tests on Taobao platform increased GMV by 4.65% and ROI by 2.44%.

Conclusion: Bid2X successfully addresses the generalizability challenge in auto-bidding and demonstrates effectiveness as a bidding foundation model, paving the way for broader applications in computational advertising.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DQNs suffer from spurious correlations due to associative learning, which limits their problem-solving effectiveness. Causal reasoning can help understand the underlying causal structure and mitigate confounding factors.

Method: Proposed framework integrates causal principles into DQNs using PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects during training.

Result: Experimental results on standard benchmarks show the approach outperforms conventional DQNs, enhancing problem-solving capabilities without performance compromise.

Conclusion: Integrating causal reasoning with DQNs presents a promising direction for advancing deep reinforcement learning agents through principled causal inference.

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

### [385] [What are the odds? Risk and uncertainty about AI existential risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23453)
*Marco Grossi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This commentary critiques Cappelen et al.'s AI existential risk model, highlighting philosophical limitations of linear risk models and arguing for higher probability of catastrophic outcomes due to structural relationships and two types of uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a philosophical critique of linear AI risk models and demonstrate how incorporating epistemic indifference and uncertainty dimensions (option and state-space) can better assess AI existential risk probabilities.

Method: Analyzes differences between standard Swiss Cheese models and the authors' approach, discusses structural relationships between risk layers, and distinguishes between risk and uncertainty by introducing option uncertainty and state-space uncertainty.

Result: The analysis suggests that probability of catastrophic outcomes P(D) is higher than initially estimated due to structural relationships between risk layers and the presence of two types of uncertainty that affect risk assessments.

Conclusion: Incorporating option uncertainty and state-space uncertainty into AI existential risk discussions provides a more comprehensive understanding of catastrophic outcome probabilities, challenging linear risk models and emphasizing the need for uncertainty-aware risk assessment frameworks.

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

*Shames Al Mandalawi,Muzakkiruddin Ahmed Mohammed,Hendrika Maclean,Mert Can Cakmak,John R. Talburt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A policy-aware controller using LLM (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) interprets natural language requests against written policies and metadata through a six-stage reasoning framework, achieving high accuracy in access decisions with audit trails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with regulations, and remain auditable, requiring translation of human-readable policies into safe, compliant machine decisions.

Method: Six-stage reasoning framework: context interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test, compliance mapping, and risk synthesis with early hard policy gates and deny by default, implemented using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

Result: Exact Decision Match improved from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9%) after policy gates, DENY recall rose to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny families dropped to 0, Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence at 14/14, high expert ratings for rationale quality, and median latency under one minute.

Conclusion: Policy constrained LLM reasoning combined with explicit gates and audit trails can effectively translate human readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

*Sima Noorani,Shayan Kiyani,George Pappas,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification, a framework that combines human expertise with AI predictions to create optimal prediction sets that avoid degrading correct human judgments while recovering outcomes humans miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack domain knowledge, long-horizon context, and physical world reasoning needed for robust decisions under uncertainty, motivating the need for collaborative frameworks that leverage complementary human and AI strengths.

Method: The authors formalize a framework where AI refines human expert's prediction sets, develop optimal collaborative prediction sets with two-threshold structure, and create offline/online calibration algorithms with distribution-free finite sample guarantees that adapt to distribution shifts.

Result: Experiments across image classification, regression, and medical decision making show collaborative prediction sets consistently outperform individual agents, achieving higher coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Conclusion: Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty Quantification provides a principled framework that enables AI to complement human expertise while avoiding harm to correct human judgments, with practical algorithms that adapt to evolving human behavior through interaction.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

*Roham Koohestani,Ziyou Li,Anton Podkopaev,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal equivalence between AI agent architectures and Chomsky hierarchy automata, showing how memory architecture determines computational power and enables formal verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled methodology for right-sizing agent architectures and create pathways for formal verification, safety guarantees, and predictability in AI systems.

Method: Mapping different AI agent architectures to corresponding automata classes: simple reflex agents to Finite Automata, hierarchical task-decomposition agents to Pushdown Automata, and reflective memory agents to Turing Machines.

Result: Development of an Automata-Agent Framework that enables classification of agents, delineation of verifiable vs. undecidable systems, and extension to probabilistic automata for risk analysis.

Conclusion: The framework provides foundations for developing static analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks, enabling formal verification and safety guarantees in AI agent design.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and Explanation Reward method to improve consistency between emotion predictions and explanations in Multimodal Large Language Models, without requiring architectural changes or additional annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based emotion understanding methods often generate explanations that diverge from target labels or contradict their own predicted emotions, which poses risks for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in human-computer interaction.

Method: Proposes Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and Explanation Reward to guide models to produce reasoning explicitly consistent with target emotions during multimodal emotion recognition, without modifying model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations.

Result: Significant improvement in faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on MAFW and DFEW datasets, with enhanced alignment between explanation and prediction through extensive experiments and human evaluations.

Conclusion: The approach empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems by ensuring consistent emotion explanations and predictions.

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

*Anirban Das,Irtaza Khalid,Rafael Peñaloza,Steven Schockaert*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoRA, a new benchmark for systematic relational reasoning that addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by requiring models to go beyond simple path-based reasoning and adding multiple difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for systematic relational reasoning are overly simplified and assume reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths, which limits model generalization and progress in the field.

Method: The authors propose NoRA, a new benchmark that introduces several levels of difficulty and requires models to perform reasoning tasks that go beyond simple path-based approaches.

Result: The paper presents NoRA as a solution to support further progress in systematic relational reasoning by providing a more challenging and comprehensive evaluation framework.

Conclusion: NoRA addresses key limitations in current systematic relational reasoning benchmarks and enables better evaluation of models' true reasoning capabilities beyond path-based approaches.

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

TL;DR: JanusCode-800K is the largest multimodal code corpus enabling JanusCoder models to generate code from text, visual inputs, or both, achieving state-of-the-art performance across coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data has impeded progress in neural code intelligence for visual outputs like charts, UIs, and animations.

Method: Developed a synthesis toolkit to create JanusCode-800K corpus, then trained JanusCoder and JanusCoderV models (7B-14B scale) for unified code generation from text, visuals, or both.

Result: JanusCoder models approach or exceed commercial model performance on text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks, establishing superior multimodal code generation capabilities.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates successful harmonization of programmatic logic with visual expression through large-scale multimodal data synthesis and unified modeling.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Motivation: Address the research gap between techno-centric robotic frameworks that lack nuanced human behavior models and descriptive behavioral ontologies not designed for real-time collaborative interpretation in human-machine teaming contexts like Industry 5.0.

Method: Developed OntoPret ontology grounded in cognitive science using modular engineering methodology, providing formal machine-processable framework for behavior classification including task deviations and deceptive actions.

Result: Demonstrated OntoPret's adaptability across manufacturing and gameplay use cases, establishing semantic foundations for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

Conclusion: OntoPret successfully bridges the gap between technical and behavioral approaches, providing a practical framework for real-time interpretation of complex human behaviors in human-machine collaboration scenarios.

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode proposes a unified approach where planning and action are represented through recursive code generation, enabling AI agents to dynamically control decision granularity by treating high-level plans as abstract functions that decompose into finer-grained sub-functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack the ability to operate fluidly across decision granularities due to rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.

Method: ReCode unifies planning and action within a single code representation, treating high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions that are recursively decomposed into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training.

Conclusion: Unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control in AI agents.

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is

TL;DR: The GenAI boom, particularly after ChatGPT's launch, has reduced public acceptance of AI and increased demand for human oversight in decision-making, while amplifying existing social inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine shifts in public attitudes toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT, as organizations rapidly integrate AI without considering user preferences.

Method: Large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488) representative of the Swiss population.

Result: Reduced public acceptance of AI (23% to 30% finding AI 'not acceptable at all') and increased support for human-only decision-making (18% to 26%). Widened educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom.

Conclusion: Findings challenge industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the importance of aligning technological development with evolving public preferences.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

*Yixing Chen,Yiding Wang,Siqi Zhu,Haofei Yu,Tao Feng,Muhan Zhan,Mostofa Patwary,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAE is a multi-agent self-evolution framework using RL to enhance LLM reasoning without human data, achieving 4.54% average improvement on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for LLMs rely on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, limiting scalability. Self-play methods need grounded environments, making general domain application challenging.

Method: MAE uses three interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) instantiated from a single LLM with RL optimization. Agents co-evolve through question generation, solution attempts, and evaluation.

Result: Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct show 4.54% average improvement across multiple benchmarks in mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A.

Conclusion: MAE provides a scalable, data-efficient approach to enhance LLM reasoning abilities with minimal human supervision, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALITA-G is a self-evolution framework that transforms general-purpose LLM agents into domain experts by generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools from successful task executions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-evolving agents are limited to prompt rewriting or failure retries, lacking systematic adaptation methods to develop domain-specific expertise from general capabilities.

Method: The framework executes domain tasks with a generalist agent, synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful trajectories, abstracts them to parameterized primitives, consolidates them into an MCP Box, and uses retrieval-augmented MCP selection at inference time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: 83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3 on GAIA validation while reducing mean tokens per example by ~15% compared to strong baseline agents.

Conclusion: ALITA-G provides a principled pathway from generalist capability to reusable domain-specific competence, improving both accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

### [398] [Environment-aware Motion Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22632)
*Jose Luis Ponton,Sheldon Andrews,Carlos Andujar,Nuria Pelechano*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Environment-aware Motion Matching is a real-time system for full-body character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents, emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional character animation techniques struggle with arbitrary situations, and existing approaches for environment interactions and crowd behaviors often involve manual setup or lack naturalism. Current methods treat body animation separately from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies.

Method: In preprocessing, extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from motion capture database. At runtime, perform efficient search that matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with dynamic environment.

Result: The method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and trajectory to navigate crowded scenes in real-time.

Conclusion: The proposed Environment-aware Motion Matching system successfully addresses limitations of traditional approaches by dynamically adapting to obstacles and agents while maintaining the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory.

Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally
to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often
struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of
dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.
While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target
trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains
challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing
approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.
Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a
separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between
body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present
Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body
character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,
emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a
preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a
motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that
matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic
environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and
trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

*Jose Luis Ponton,Eduardo Alvarado,Lin Geng Foo,Nuria Pelechano,Carlos Andujar,Marc Habermann*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Step2Motion is the first method to reconstruct human locomotion from multi-modal insole sensors using pressure and inertial data, enabling motion capture in diverse real-world scenarios without constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human motion is driven by physical interaction with the environment, particularly through foot-ground forces. Wearable insole devices offer unconstrained motion capture without line-of-sight limitations, making them ideal for outdoor environments, but their potential with recent motion reconstruction methods remains unexplored.

Method: The approach utilizes pressure and inertial data (accelerations and angular rates) captured by multi-modal insole sensors to reconstruct human motion.

Result: The method effectively reconstructs diverse locomotion styles including walking, jogging, moving sideways, walking on tiptoes, slightly crouching, and dancing.

Conclusion: Step2Motion successfully demonstrates the capability to reconstruct human locomotion from insole sensor data, providing a robust solution for unconstrained motion capture in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with
the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces
exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for
understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable
insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in
diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'
motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in
contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal
choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor
environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion
reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we
present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from
multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial
data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct
human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of
experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple
ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly
crouching, or dancing.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: FlowCapX is a physics-enhanced framework for reconstructing flow velocities from sparse video inputs using a hybrid multi-scale approach that separates representation and supervision to jointly optimize physical constraints and observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture turbulent motion while maintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. The challenge lies in jointly optimizing complex physical constraints with sparse observational data over long time horizons.

Method: A hybrid framework that separates representation and supervision across spatial scales: coarse level resolves sparse-view ambiguities via optimization aligning long-term observation with physics-grounded velocity fields using vorticity-based constraints; fine level prioritizes observational fidelity to preserve turbulent structures.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream tasks including accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer visualization, and re-simulation.

Conclusion: FlowCapX successfully addresses the challenge of joint optimization of physical constraints and sparse data through its physics-enhanced, multi-scale framework, achieving superior flow reconstruction quality and enabling practical downstream applications.

Abstract: We present FlowCapX, a physics-enhanced framework for flow reconstruction
from sparse video inputs, addressing the challenge of jointly optimizing
complex physical constraints and sparse observational data over long time
horizons. Existing methods often struggle to capture turbulent motion while
maintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Focusing on velocity inference, our approach introduces a
hybrid framework that strategically separates representation and supervision
across spatial scales. At the coarse level, we resolve sparse-view ambiguities
via a novel optimization strategy that aligns long-term observation with
physics-grounded velocity fields. By emphasizing vorticity-based physical
constraints, our method enhances physical fidelity and improves optimization
stability. At the fine level, we prioritize observational fidelity to preserve
critical turbulent structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream
tasks, e.g., accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer
visualization and re-simulation.
