### [1] [Generating the Past, Present and Future from a Motion-Blurred Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19817)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new technique uses pre-trained video diffusion models to recover scene dynamics from motion-blurred images, revealing what happened before, during, and after image capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur encodes information about scene and camera motion, but existing methods rely on handcrafted priors and struggle with complex dynamics. They also don't recover what occurred before or after image capture.

Method: Repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos showing scene dynamics during capture and what might have occurred immediately before or after.

Result: Outperforms previous methods, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks like recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

Conclusion: The approach is robust and versatile, demonstrating that motion-blurred images can reveal rich information about scene dynamics across time using large-scale video priors.

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

### [2] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM is a novel physical adversarial attack framework that uses anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent adversarial examples that fool object detectors in connected autonomous vehicles, causing both individual vehicle deception and network-wide disruption through V2X communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected autonomous vehicles rely on vision-based DNNs and V2X communication, but remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. Current attacks often require model access or lack transferability across different detector architectures.

Method: PHANTOM uses anamorphic art techniques to craft perspective-dependent adversarial examples that appear natural to humans but are misclassified by object detectors. It operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates transferability across four detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet).

Result: PHANTOM achieves over 90% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80% effectiveness in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. It also triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89% and degrading safety-critical communication.

Conclusion: PHANTOM exposes critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems, demonstrating that physical adversarial attacks can cause both individual vehicle deception and network-wide disruption through V2X communication propagation.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models that generates realistic focal stacks from single defocused images, enabling interactive focus adjustment after photo capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autofocus systems often fail to capture intended subjects, and users frequently want to adjust focus after taking photos. Current limitations in post-capture focus editing create a need for more advanced refocusing capabilities in everyday photography.

Conclusion: The approach paves the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography by providing realistic post-capture refocusing from single defocused images using video diffusion models.

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper revisits scoring functions for geometric model fitting, analyzes MAGSAC++'s derivation flaws, and finds all scoring functions perform similarly in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine scoring functions for robust geometric model fitting, particularly analyzing the state-of-the-art MAGSAC++ method and establishing proper evaluation methodology.

Method: Extends geometric error to spherical noises, analyzes mixture models with outliers, examines MAGSAC++ derivation, and proposes experimental methodology using validation sets.

Result: MAGSAC++ derivation has flaws and is numerically equivalent to simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood; all scoring functions perform identically in experiments.

Conclusion: Comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis reveals MAGSAC++ has no advantage over simpler methods, providing critical insights for future robust fitting research.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ introduces a hybrid view-transformation framework with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to improve geometric consistency and boundary awareness for 3D panoptic occupancy prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Occ3D-nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D panoptic occupancy prediction methods struggle with maintaining precise geometry and capturing accurate spatial ranges of 3D instances, which is critical for robust panoptic separation in complex environments.

Method: HyGE-Occ uses a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with discretized depth-bin formulation to produce geometrically consistent BEV features. It also extracts edge maps from BEV features as auxiliary information to learn edge cues for better boundary awareness.

Result: On the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach with Gaussian and edge priors effectively enhances both geometric consistency and boundary awareness, leading to improved 3D panoptic occupancy prediction performance.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Widget2Code: A new benchmark and baseline system for generating executable code from widget images, addressing unique challenges of compact, context-free micro-interfaces with proprietary designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior UI2Code research focuses on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Widgets present unique challenges: they're compact, context-free micro-interfaces with dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints, and lack accessible markup data unlike web/mobile UIs.

Method: 1) Created Widget2Code benchmark with image-only widget data and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. 2) Developed baseline system with perceptual understanding (atomic component assembly, icon retrieval, reusable visualization) and structured code generation. 3) Built WidgetFactory infrastructure with framework-agnostic WidgetDSL and compiler for multiple front-end implementations, plus adaptive rendering for spatial refinement.

Result: Benchmarking shows generalized MLLMs outperform specialized UI2Code methods but still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. The proposed baseline substantially enhances visual fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for future Widget2Code research.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the Widget2Code problem, provides a comprehensive benchmark, and develops an effective baseline system that advances both perceptual understanding and structured code generation, creating unified infrastructure for future research in this underexplored domain.

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [7] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign is a deep learning framework that jointly registers cortical surfaces and subcortical volumes in brain MRI scans using a unified representation with spherical coordinate space, achieving superior accuracy and speed compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain MRI registration methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, leading to inconsistencies that limit downstream neuroscientific analyses. There's a need for a unified approach that ensures anatomical coherence between cortical and subcortical regions.

Method: NeurAlign uses a deep learning framework with an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy. It integrates spherical registration into learning to ensure geometric coherence between volume and surface domains, requiring only an MRI scan as input.

Result: The method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods, improving Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. It's orders of magnitude faster than standard methods and simpler to use with no additional inputs beyond MRI scans.

Conclusion: NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration with superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, enabling more consistent and anatomically accurate cross-subject brain MRI analysis.

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers exhibit block-recurrent depth structure where original L blocks can be approximated by k≪L distinct blocks applied recurrently, enabling dynamical systems analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a mechanistic account of Vision Transformers' computational phenomenology by interpreting Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow, addressing the lack of settled framework for understanding their dynamical structure.

Method: Proposed Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH) and trained block-recurrent surrogates called Raptor (Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers) to test whether few contiguous phases in representational similarity matrices reflect genuinely reusable computation.

Result: Demonstrated that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure; trained Raptor recovered 96% of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost; discovered directional convergence, token-specific dynamics, and low-rank updates consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors.

Conclusion: A compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, revealing a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [9] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360 is a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas using a coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline and Transformer-based diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-based image editing methods produce implausible results when applied to 360° panoramas in both equirectangular projections and perspective views, creating a need for specialized solutions for panoramic editing.

Method: 1) Coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline using Vision-Language Model and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis; 2) Two-stage data refinement strategy to improve realism and reduce artifacts; 3) Transformer-based diffusion model trained on constructed dataset for flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and semantic accuracy for 360° panorama editing, producing semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent results even from unlabeled panoramas.

Conclusion: SE360 provides an effective framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360° panoramas, addressing the unique challenges of panoramic editing through automated data generation and specialized model architecture.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Foundation Models trained on 2D videos can develop strong 3D understanding without explicit 3D training, sometimes surpassing specialized 3D models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether global 3D understanding naturally emerges in Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) trained on large-scale 2D video data, and to quantify their 3D awareness capabilities.

Method: Proposed a model-agnostic framework that measures 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features using shallow read-outs, enabling systematic benchmarking.

Result: State-of-the-art video generation models exhibit strong 3D understanding of objects and scenes despite no 3D training, sometimes surpassing specialized 3D models. Comprehensive 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs provides valuable insights.

Conclusion: 3D understanding can emerge naturally from 2D video training, providing promising pathways for building scalable 3D models without explicit 3D supervision.

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-throughput pathomic analysis of Whole Slide Images lacks tools to measure spatial interactions of tissue characteristics and their association with clinical parameters, limiting clinical relevance of tissue characteristics at micro- and macro-environment levels.

Result: Applied as proof of concept to analyze 102 features (72 conventional object-level features + 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project. Code and data released publicly.

Conclusion: HistoWAS provides a computational framework to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes, addressing limitations in current pathomic analysis tools and enabling biomarker discovery through spatial feature analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

*Tamim Ahasan Rijon,Yeasin Arafath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ensemble model combining CNN with Gradient Boosting Machine to detect guava diseases (Anthracnose and Fruit Flies) with ~99.99% accuracy using a new dataset from Bangladesh.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Guava is economically important in Bangladesh, but diseases like Anthracnose and fruit fly infections reduce quality and productivity. Early detection through expert systems can minimize losses and protect harvests.

Method: Created CNN-ML cascade framework using ensemble models that combine CNN with Gradient Boosting Machine. Used the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24) with images from Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh, classified into Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes.

Result: Achieved approximately 99.99% classification accuracy for guava disease detection using the proposed ensemble model combining CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine.

Conclusion: The CNN-ML cascade framework demonstrates strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection suitable for real-time agricultural monitoring systems in Bangladesh.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

### [13] [A Dual-Branch Local-Global Framework for Cross-Resolution Land Cover Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19990)
*Peng Gao,Ke Li,Di Wang,Yongshan Zhu,Yiming Zhang,Xuemei Luo,Yifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTM is a dual-branch weakly supervised framework for cross-resolution land cover mapping that decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning to address resolution mismatch challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-resolution land cover mapping faces severe resolution mismatch between coarse/low-resolution supervision and high-resolution predictions, causing noisy supervision and degraded accuracy in existing weakly supervised approaches.

Method: DDTM uses a dual-branch framework: 1) diffusion-based branch for progressive fine-scale local semantic refinement under coarse supervision, 2) transformer-based branch for long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents, plus a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise.

Result: DDTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chesapeake Bay benchmark with 66.52% mIoU, substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-branch framework effectively addresses cross-resolution challenges in land cover mapping by decoupling local refinement from global reasoning and mitigating supervision noise through confidence evaluation.

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: MIVA is a lightweight modular adapter system for diffusion models that enables precise motion control for image animation with minimal training data, overcoming memorization and generalization limitations.


<details>

Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with image animation due to high video dimensionality causing data scarcity, leading to memorization over prompt compliance, and poor generalization to novel motion patterns not in training data.

Method: Proposes Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA) - lightweight sub-networks attachable to pre-trained DMs, each capturing a single motion pattern, scalable via parallelization, trainable on ~10 samples with consumer GPU.

Result: MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining or surpassing generation quality of models trained on larger datasets, eliminating need for prompt engineering at inference.

Conclusion: MIVA addresses key limitations of diffusion models for image animation through modular, data-efficient adapters that provide precise motion control without extensive training data or prompt engineering.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

TL;DR: LaSeRS dataset addresses complex language-to-pixel grounding in remote sensing by covering hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning, and linguistic variability. SegEarth-R2 model with spatial attention supervision and flexible segmentation queries achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models fail at complex geospatial scenarios like multi-target segmentation and implicit intent interpretation, limiting real-world applications in disaster response and environmental monitoring. Existing datasets oversimplify these challenges.

Method: Created LaSeRS dataset covering four dimensions of language-guided segmentation. Proposed SegEarth-R2 MLLM architecture with spatial attention supervision for small object localization and flexible segmentation query mechanism for single/multi-target scenarios.

Result: SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for next-generation geospatial segmentation.

Conclusion: LaSeRS dataset and SegEarth-R2 model address critical gaps in complex language-guided segmentation for remote sensing, enabling more robust real-world applications.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adding road-facing views to driver-facing footage can improve distracted driving detection, but performance gains depend on model architecture - some benefit while others suffer from representational conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing distracted driving detection models rely only on driver-facing views and overlook environmental context that influences driving behavior, creating a need to investigate whether incorporating road-facing views improves detection accuracy.

Method: Used synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving to benchmark three spatiotemporal action recognition architectures (SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, SlowOnly-R50) under two configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view inputs.

Result: Contextual inputs improved detection in some models but not all: SlowOnly-R50 achieved 9.8% improvement with dual-view, while SlowFast-R50 experienced 7.2% accuracy drop due to representational conflicts. Performance gains depend strongly on underlying architecture.

Conclusion: Simply adding visual context is insufficient and may cause interference; architecture must be specifically designed for multi-view integration. Future multimodal driver monitoring systems require fusion-aware design for effective distraction detection.

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPI-GNN is a novel graph neural network that learns multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces for multimodal medical diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on diverse medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph neural networks in medical diagnosis rely on single, static graphs built from indiscriminate features, which limits their ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships and compromises diagnostic efficacy.

Method: MAPI-GNN reconstructs the single-graph paradigm by: 1) uncovering latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator, 2) dynamically constructing a stack of activation graphs guided by these patterns, and 3) aggregating and contextualizing this multifaceted profile through a relational fusion engine.

Result: Extensive experiments on two diverse medical tasks with over 1300 patient samples demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN successfully addresses the limitations of single-graph approaches in medical diagnosis by learning multifaceted graph profiles from semantically disentangled feature subspaces, enabling more robust modeling of patient-specific pathological relationships.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: H2em: Hierarchical Hyperbolic Embeddings for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning, using hyperbolic geometry to better model hierarchical structures and improve generalization on unseen state-object compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CZSL methods overlook rich hierarchical structures and fail to scale to large-scale taxonomies due to Euclidean space limitations. Hyperbolic geometry is naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion, addressing the exponential growth of compositional hierarchies.

Method: Proposes H2em framework with hyperbolic embeddings, Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss using hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce predefined hierarchies, Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining for better discrimination, and Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention for instance-aware cross-modal fusion.

Result: Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate H2em establishes new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world compositional zero-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry effectively addresses the limitations of Euclidean space for modeling hierarchical structures in CZSL, with H2em providing a comprehensive framework that leverages hyperbolic properties through specialized losses and attention mechanisms for superior performance.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

### [20] [VALLR-Pin: Dual-Decoding Visual Speech Recognition for Mandarin with Pinyin-Guided LLM Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20032)
*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin is a two-stage Mandarin lip-reading framework that combines visual features with phonetic context using dual decoders for characters and Pinyin, followed by LLM-based error correction with synthetic training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin visual speech recognition is challenging due to ambiguous visemes and prevalent homophones, requiring better integration of phonetic and linguistic context.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Shared video encoder with dual decoders predicting Chinese characters and Pinyin romanization; 2) LLM-based error correction using candidate transcripts and Pinyin prompts, fine-tuned on synthetic noisy examples from intermediate checkpoints.

Result: The method synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance through multi-task learning and LLM-enhanced error correction.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin effectively addresses Mandarin lip-reading challenges by combining visual-semantic representations with explicit phonetic context and LLM-based refinement trained on model-specific error patterns.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashLips is a real-time lip-sync system that separates lips control from rendering, achieving 100+ FPS with state-of-the-art visual quality using a two-stage approach without masks, GANs, or diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a lip-sync system that achieves real-time performance (100+ FPS) while maintaining high visual quality, without relying on complex components like GANs, diffusion models, or explicit masks that complicate the pipeline.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage 1 uses a compact one-step latent-space editor trained with reconstruction losses only, employing self-supervision with mouth-altered variants to eliminate explicit masks. Stage 2 uses an audio-to-pose transformer with flow-matching to predict lips-poses vectors from speech.

Result: The system achieves real-time performance of over 100 FPS on a single GPU while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models, combining deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control in a simple, stable pipeline.

Conclusion: FlashLips demonstrates that high-quality lip-sync can be achieved with real-time performance through a decoupled approach that separates lips control from rendering, using simple reconstruction losses and self-supervision instead of complex generative models.

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Method: Multimodal pipeline that: 1) retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, 2) reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, 3) extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search, and 4) integrates context with base captions (generated by Instruct BLIP Vicuna-7B) using a fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA.

Result: Evaluated on OpenEvents v1 dataset, the approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal pipeline effectively addresses the contextual gap in image captions by augmenting visual input with external textual knowledge, producing event-enriched, context-aware descriptions with strong real-world application potential.

Motivation: While learned image codecs have extended from human to machine perception, progressive compression with fine granular scalability remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. There's a need for efficient progressive transmission that maintains high performance in downstream machine tasks.

Method: Proposed PICM-Net based on trit-plane coding, analyzing differences between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities to determine latent prioritization strategies.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression that enables efficient progressive transmission with real-world adaptability for machine perception applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fashion style classification is challenging due to large visual variation within styles and visually similar styles. Styles are expressed through global appearance, individual item attributes, and their combinations, requiring a more comprehensive approach.

Method: IRSN uses item region pooling to extract features from each item region, analyzes them separately, and combines them with gated feature fusion. It employs a dual-backbone architecture combining domain-specific and general feature extractors pre-trained on large-scale image-text data.

Result: IRSN improved style classification accuracy by average 6.9% (max 14.5%) on FashionStyle14 and average 7.6% (max 15.1%) on ShowniqV3 across six backbones. Visualization analysis showed better capture of differences between similar style classes.

Conclusion: IRSN effectively classifies fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations alongside global features, outperforming baseline models and better capturing subtle style differences.

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how activation functions and optimizers affect Human Activity Recognition performance in healthcare applications, finding ConvLSTM with Adam/RMSprop achieves up to 99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human Activity Recognition is crucial for healthcare and surveillance, but the impact of activation functions and optimizers on deep learning-based HAR systems hasn't been sufficiently studied, especially how their combinations affect practical performance.

Method: The study investigates three activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh) combined with four optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad) using two recurrent architectures (BiLSTM and ConvLSTM). Experiments use six medically relevant activity classes from HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets.

Result: ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM with Adam or RMSprop achieves up to 99.00% accuracy, showing strong spatio-temporal learning. BiLSTM performs well on UCF101 (~98%) but drops to ~60% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems in healthcare environments, showing ConvLSTM with Adam/RMSprop offers superior performance for fast and precise activity detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous LiDAR generation methods struggle with high-quality results and versatile controllability due to imbalance between complex LiDAR distributions and simple control signals.

Method: Uses 3D layouts as bridge between conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds; transforms text/images/point clouds into unified 3D layouts, then semantic and depth control signals; employs rangemap-based ControlNet for pixel-level alignment guidance.

Result: Excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point cloud generation, enabling "simulation from scratch" from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft addresses limitations of previous methods by using 3D layouts as intermediate representation, achieving high-quality controllable LiDAR generation for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid framework combining deterministic and stochastic approaches for novel view synthesis, achieving SOTA quality with 10x faster rendering than fully generative methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic NVS methods render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, while diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content but are computationally expensive. There's a need to unify both paradigms' strengths.

Method: A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings into a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads: (1) feed-forward regression head for well-constrained geometry, (2) masked autoregressive diffusion head for occluded/unseen regions. End-to-end training with joint photometric and diffusion losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared to fully generative baselines.

Conclusion: The hybrid framework successfully unifies deterministic and stochastic approaches, enabling scalable novel view synthesis across diverse scenes without handcrafted 3D inductive biases.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

*Hao Guo,Xugong Qin,Jun Jie Ou Yang,Peng Zhang,Gangyan Zeng,Yubo Li,Hailun Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark for document image retrieval using natural language queries instead of image queries, with 41K document images and fine-grained semantic descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document image retrieval methods rely on image queries and only work for coarse semantic categories, but real-world scenarios require textual queries with fine-grained semantics.

Method: Created NL-DIR benchmark with 41K document images paired with 5 high-quality natural language queries each, generated using LLMs with manual verification. Evaluated existing vision-language models and VDU models, and investigated a two-stage retrieval method.

Result: Proposed benchmark enables evaluation of document retrieval with natural language queries. Two-stage retrieval method improves performance while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR benchmark addresses the gap between existing DIR methods and real-world needs for textual queries, providing new opportunities for visual document understanding research.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection, with uncertainty quantification and cross-modal attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of visual assessment and single-modal approaches (GPR struggles with moisture/shallow defects, thermography has weather dependency/depth limits) for deteriorating civil infrastructure inspection.

Method: Multi-modal attention network with temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, cross-modal fusion with learnable embeddings, Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification, and learned variance estimation decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components.

Result: Substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC on balanced to moderately imbalanced data across five bridge datasets; cross-modal attention provides critical gains beyond within-modality attention; uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error enabling selective prediction.

Conclusion: Attention-based architecture performs well across typical scenarios while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques; system maintains deployment efficiency for real-time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDAVS is a framework for Audio-Visual Segmentation that addresses multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, causing biases toward louder/larger objects while overlooking weaker/smaller/co-occurring sources.

Method: Uses learnable queries to extract audio semantics anchored in a semantic space from an audio prototype memory bank, optimized via contrastive learning. Introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction for robust multimodal alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches on AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: DDAVS effectively addresses key challenges in AVS through disentangled audio semantics and delayed bidirectional alignment, showing robust performance in challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

### [31] [HEART-VIT: Hessian-Guided Efficient Dynamic Attention and Token Pruning in Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20120)
*Mohammad Helal Uddin,Liam Seymour,Sabur Baidya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEART-ViT is a Hessian-guided dynamic attention and token pruning framework for Vision Transformers that uses second-order sensitivity analysis to achieve up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention cost and redundant computations, making them inefficient for deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning methods treat tokens or heads in isolation using heuristics, often sacrificing accuracy or failing to generalize.

Method: HEART-ViT uses Hessian-vector products to estimate curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets. It combines token pruning (for computational savings) with head pruning (for fine-grained redundancy removal) in a unified second-order framework.

Result: On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4% FLOPs reduction, 36% lower latency, and 46% higher throughput while matching or surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning (e.g., 4.7% recovery at 40% token pruning). Real-world deployment on edge devices like AGX Orin shows direct translation to inference speed and energy efficiency gains.

Conclusion: HEART-ViT bridges theory and practice as the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient, revealing that token pruning dominates computational savings while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, with their combination achieving superior trade-offs.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: milliMamba is a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that uses Mamba architecture to handle sparse radar signals by jointly modeling spatio-temporal dependencies, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millimeter-wave radar provides privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant sensing for human pose estimation, but suffers from sparse signals due to specular reflection, making robust feature extraction challenging.

Method: Uses Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction from high-dimensional radar inputs with linear complexity, and Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder to predict joint coordinates across frames. Incorporates velocity loss alongside keypoint loss for motion smoothness.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding baselines by 11.0 AP on TransHuPR dataset and 14.6 AP on HuPR dataset, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed milliMamba framework effectively addresses sparse radar signal challenges through joint spatio-temporal modeling, enabling robust human pose estimation from privacy-preserving radar sensors.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

### [33] [Enhancing annotations for 5D apple pose estimation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20148)
*Robert van de Ven,Trim Bresilla,Bram Nelissen,Ard Nieuwenhuizen,Eldert J. van Henten,Gert Kootstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using 3D Gaussian Splatting for orchard scene reconstruction dramatically reduces manual annotation requirements by 99.6% for apple pose estimation, achieving high F1 scores despite occlusion challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple pose estimation in orchards is challenging due to environmental variation, occlusions, and the difficulty of annotating key points like calyxes. Traditional methods require time-consuming manual annotations that are further complicated by conflicting/missing annotations across images due to occlusions.

Method: Proposes a novel pipeline: 1) 3D Gaussian Splatting for orchard scene reconstruction, 2) simplified annotations, 3) automated projection of annotations to images, and 4) training/evaluation of pose estimation methods. Uses 105 manual annotations to generate 28,191 training labels.

Result: Training with ≤95% occluded fruits yielded best performance: F1 score 0.927 on original images and 0.970 on rendered images. Manual annotation reduced by 99.6%. Least occluded fruits had best position estimation, worsening with increased occlusion. Orientation estimation remained problematic.

Conclusion: The 3D reconstruction pipeline significantly reduces annotation burden while maintaining good pose estimation performance, though orientation estimation remains challenging. The approach enables efficient dataset creation for occluded fruit pose estimation in orchard automation.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

*Grega Šuštar,Jer Pelhan,Alan Lukežič,Matej Kristan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a latent diffusion-based low-shot object counter that generates high-quality density maps for accurate object localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on FSC and MCAC benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-shot object counting methods face challenges with dense regions containing small objects. Density-based counters have poor localization capabilities, while point-detection-based counters underperform on images with very large numbers of objects and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling.

Method: CoDi uses latent diffusion to produce high-quality density maps, with a novel exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts object prototypes to intermediate layers of the denoising network, enabling accurate object location estimation via non-maxima suppression.

Result: On FSC benchmark: 15% MAE improvement in few-shot, 13% MAE in one-shot, and 10% MAE in reference-less scenarios. On MCAC benchmark: 44% MAE improvement over top method, setting new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoDi is the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that effectively addresses dense object counting with accurate localization, significantly outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Method: Introduces AMoE (Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models) that distills knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. Key innovations: 1) Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserving geometric properties of each teacher, 2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets, 3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data for improved sample efficiency.

Result: The approach enables training at lower computational cost while maintaining performance. The authors curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus demonstrating superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. They release both the dataset and distilled models.

Conclusion: Multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models can be made more efficient through careful design of distillation losses, batching strategies, and data sampling techniques. The proposed AMoE framework successfully distills knowledge from multiple teachers while preserving their geometric properties and enabling stable training across resolutions.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLC is a generative latent coding architecture that performs compression in VQ-VAE latent space instead of pixel space, achieving high realism/fidelity at ultra-low bitrates (<0.04 bpp).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pixel-space compression struggles with high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrates due to misalignment between pixel distortion and human perception.

Method: Transform coding in VQ-VAE latent space, plus categorical hyper module for bit reduction and code-prediction supervision for semantic consistency.

Result: Achieves <0.04 bpp on natural images, <0.01 bpp on facial images, and matches MS-ILLM FID with 45% fewer bits on CLIC2020.

Conclusion: GLC's generative latent space enables superior compression and supports applications like image restoration and style transfer.

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: JDPNet is a unified network that addresses coupled underwater image degradations through joint feature mining and probabilistic bootstrap distribution, achieving state-of-the-art performance with balanced computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer from complex, nonlinearly coupled degradations (not simple superposition), but existing methods focus on specific degradations individually and fail to capture the embedded coupling information between multiple degradations.

Method: Proposes JDPNet with: 1) Joint feature-mining module to extract coupled degradation features, 2) Probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy for unified adjustment, and 3) AquaBalanceLoss to balance color, clarity, and contrast from multiple coupled degradation losses.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on six public underwater datasets plus two new datasets, with better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively processes coupled underwater degradations by mining and unifying their potential information within a unified framework, outperforming specialized approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

TL;DR: LiteFusion is a novel multi-modal 3D detector that uses LiDAR as complementary geometric information for camera-based detection, eliminating 3D backbone dependency for better deployment across diverse hardware platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal 3D detectors rely heavily on LiDAR and complex architectures, suffering performance drops without LiDAR and deployment difficulties on non-GPU hardware due to 3D sparse convolution operators optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.

Method: Instead of treating LiDAR as independent modality with separate backbone, LiteFusion integrates LiDAR point cloud features as complementary geometric information into image features within quaternion space, preserving orthogonal constraints during training to model domain-specific cross-modal relations.

Result: On nuScenes dataset, LiteFusion improves baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with only 1.1% parameter increase, without dedicated LiDAR encoders. Maintains strong performance even without LiDAR input.

Conclusion: LiteFusion offers deployment-friendly 3D detection by eliminating 3D backbone dependency, achieving robust performance across diverse fusion paradigms and hardware platforms while maintaining effectiveness even when LiDAR is absent.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing document layout datasets lack fine-grained labels, multilingual diversity, and adequate representation of Indic documents with diverse scripts, limiting progress in document understanding for underrepresented languages.

Method: Created IndicDLP dataset spanning 11 Indic languages and English across 12 document domains, and curated UED-mini dataset from DocLayNet and M6Doc for pretraining foundation.

Result: Fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, and models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, validating dataset effectiveness.

Conclusion: IndicDLP bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, providing a valuable resource for inclusive document digitization and driving progress in multilingual document understanding.

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMP is a unified HSI restoration framework that uses degradation metrics as prompts instead of explicit degradation labels, enabling adaptive restoration under diverse degradations through spatial-spectral adaptive modules and mixture-of-experts architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unified HSI restoration methods rely on explicit degradation priors/labels as prompts, which are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios with complex mixed degradations. There's a need for methods that can handle diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations without requiring predefined degradation information.

Method: Proposes Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework with: 1) Spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations as Degradation Prompts (DP), 2) Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates feature extraction, 3) Mixture-of-Experts architecture using SSAM as experts and DP as gating router for adaptive restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

Conclusion: DAMP provides an effective unified HSI restoration framework that doesn't require explicit degradation priors, enabling robust performance across various degradation scenarios through degradation-aware metric prompting and adaptive feature modulation.

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

*Jinghao Shi,Jianing Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiCoR-Seg is a bidirectional co-refinement framework for high-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation that addresses inter-class similarity and intra-class variability through heatmap-driven bidirectional information synergy and hierarchical supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to effectively inject abstract semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning for HRSS, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes with high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability.

Method: Proposes BiCoR-Seg with: 1) Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS) establishing bidirectional flow between feature maps and class embeddings via class-level heatmaps; 2) Hierarchical supervision using interpretable heatmaps as low-resolution predictions; 3) Cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss for intra-class compactness and inter-class separability.

Result: Extensive experiments on LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg effectively addresses HRSS challenges by establishing bidirectional refinement between feature learning and semantic knowledge, achieving superior performance with enhanced interpretability through heatmap-driven synergy and discriminative embedding learning.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability. The released code is available at https://github.com/ShiJinghao566/BiCoR-Seg.

TL;DR: LADLE-MM is a lightweight multimodal misinformation detector that achieves competitive performance with 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous SOTA models, operating effectively with limited annotations and constrained resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of easily accessible multimedia manipulation tools has created widespread threats of synthetic content and misinformation across multiple modalities, especially on social media. Existing detection methods are computationally intensive or require large annotated datasets, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: LADLE-MM uses a model-soup initialized architecture with two unimodal branches (image and text) and a third multimodal branch that enhances representations with BLIP-extracted multimodal embeddings as a fixed reference space. It's designed for limited annotation setups and constrained training resources.

Result: Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous SOTA models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on DGM4 benchmark for binary and multi-label classification, outperforming existing methods without grounding annotations. On VERITE dataset, it outperforms more complex LVLM-based approaches, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness to unimodal bias.

Conclusion: LADLE-MM provides an effective, lightweight solution for multimodal misinformation detection that works well with limited annotations and resources, offering strong generalization capabilities and robustness while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

*Jiawei Ge,Jiuxin Cao,Xinyi Li,Xuelin Zhu,Chang Liu,Bo Liu,Chen Feng,Ioannis Patras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D³ETOR is a two-stage WSCOD framework that uses debate-enhanced pseudo labeling and frequency-aware progressive debiasing to improve camouflaged object detection with only scribble annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing WSCOD methods underperform fully supervised approaches due to unreliable pseudo masks from general segmentation models lacking COD-specific understanding, and neglect of scribble annotation bias that prevents capturing global object structure.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling with adaptive entropy-driven point sampling and multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance SAM for COD; 2) FADeNet that progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantics with local details while dynamically reweighting supervision to alleviate scribble bias.

Result: D³ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing WSCOD methods by improving pseudo mask quality and mitigating scribble annotation bias through joint exploitation of pseudo masks and scribble semantics.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

*Akshat Dubey,Aleksandar Anžel,Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging, addressing instability from epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging have become increasingly complex (ResNets, Vision Transformers, Hybrid CNNs), compromising explainability and interpretability. SHAP provides interpretable visualizations but suffers from instability and unreliability due to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, which is particularly problematic in medical applications where reliable explanations are critical.

Method: The framework uses Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations. It employs belief, plausible, and fusion map approaches alongside statistical quantitative analysis to measure uncertainty. The method was evaluated on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types (pathology, ophthalmology, radiology) that introduce significant epistemic uncertainty.

Result: The study developed a framework that successfully quantifies uncertainty in SHAP explanations for medical imaging applications. The approach addresses the instability and unreliability issues by incorporating uncertainty quantification methods, though specific numerical results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the challenge of unstable SHAP explanations in medical imaging by quantifying uncertainty through Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory. This provides more reliable and interpretable explanations for domain experts working with complex deep learning models in medical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies typically explore talking/listening head generation and conversational speech generation in isolation, overlooking the tightly coupled audio-visual interactions in human conversation. The goal is to build more human-like conversational systems.

Method: TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers: a motion mapper and a speaker mapper, enabling bidirectional exchange of complementary information between audio and visual modalities for synchronized generation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality.

Conclusion: TAVID successfully generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner, addressing the multimodal nature of human conversation through cross-modal information exchange.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

TL;DR: KeyTailor: A keyframe-driven diffusion transformer framework for video virtual try-on that captures fine-grained garment dynamics while preserving background integrity, using a novel dataset ViT-HD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT-based video virtual try-on methods struggle with capturing fine-grained garment dynamics, preserving background integrity across frames, have high computational costs from additional modules, and are limited by small, low-quality datasets.

Method: KeyTailor uses keyframe-driven details injection: 1) instruction-guided keyframe sampling to filter informative frames, 2) garment details enhancement module to distill garment dynamics into latents, 3) collaborative background optimization module to optimize background latents, then injects enriched details into standard DiT blocks with pose, mask, and noise latents.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios, using the new ViT-HD dataset with 15,070 high-quality video samples at 810*1080 resolution.

Conclusion: KeyTailor enables efficient and realistic video virtual try-on by leveraging keyframes to capture garment dynamics and background consistency without modifying DiT architecture or adding complexity, while the ViT-HD dataset addresses data limitations.

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

*V. Kovalev,A. Kuvshinov,A. Buzovkin,D. Pokidov,D. Timonin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a training-free framework that applies structured reasoning to improve text-to-image generation through iterative verification and targeted prompt editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time reasoning approaches for text-to-image generation lack interpretability, control, and reliable stopping mechanisms, while LLMs benefit from structured verification and correction methods.

Method: CRAFT decomposes prompts into dependency-structured visual questions, verifies generated images using a vision-language model, applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail, and iterates with explicit stopping criteria.

Result: CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations across multiple model families and benchmarks, with strong gains for lightweight generators and negligible inference-time overhead.

Conclusion: Explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is crucial for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models, allowing smaller models to approach the quality of more expensive systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

TL;DR: SmartSplat is a Gaussian Splatting-based image compression framework that uses adaptive sampling strategies to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining reconstruction quality for ultra-high-resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses challenges in compressing ultra-high-resolution visual content generated by AI, where existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity. Current 2D Gaussian image models inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting lack efficiency in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Method: SmartSplat uses image-aware features (gradients and color variances) with Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling and Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling to improve Gaussian primitive coverage. It also employs Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling for better color initialization across scales, optimizing spatial layout, scale, and color jointly.

Result: Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a new 16K dataset show SmartSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios, exceeds their compression limits, and demonstrates strong scalability and practical applicability.

Conclusion: SmartSplat provides an effective solution for ultra-high-resolution image compression using adaptive Gaussian splatting techniques, achieving superior compression-performance tradeoffs with practical deployment potential.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

TL;DR: DETACH: A decomposed spatio-temporal framework for aligning exocentric video with ambient sensors, addressing limitations of global alignment approaches in capturing local details and handling temporal pattern misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing egocentric video with wearable sensors has practical limitations (user discomfort, privacy, scalability). Exocentric video with ambient sensors offers a non-intrusive alternative, but global alignment methods fail to capture local details and misalign actions with similar temporal patterns but different spatio-semantic contexts.

Method: DETACH framework with explicit spatio-temporal decomposition preserves local details. Uses novel sensor-spatial features via online clustering for semantic grounding. Two-stage alignment: spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then temporal alignment via spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles different negative types.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets show substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: DETACH effectively addresses limitations of global alignment for exocentric-ambient sensor settings, enabling better action recognition through decomposed spatio-temporal features and adaptive alignment strategies.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Conclusion: The CoAT framework effectively addresses the normality bias in surveillance systems by incorporating criminal bias in the reasoning process, leading to substantial improvements in anomaly detection and classification across different video resolutions.

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations.

*Long Nguyen,Micha Fauth,Bernhard Jaeger,Daniel Dauner,Maximilian Igl,Andreas Geiger,Kashyap Chitta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations as a key limitation in imitation learning for autonomous driving, and proposes interventions that achieve state-of-the-art performance on CARLA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite access to unlimited simulator data, imitation learning policies still struggle with robust closed-loop performance. The paper investigates how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations (with higher visibility and lower uncertainty) and sensor-based student observations limits imitation learning effectiveness.

Method: The authors empirically study the misalignment problem and propose practical interventions to narrow the gaps between expert and student. They develop TransFuser v6 (TFv6) with careful modifications addressing visibility asymmetries, uncertainty differences, and navigational intent underspecification.

Result: TFv6 achieves state-of-the-art performance on all major CARLA closed-loop benchmarks: 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Integration of perception supervision also shows consistent gains on NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Conclusion: Addressing the misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations through targeted interventions significantly improves imitation learning performance, enabling new state-of-the-art results in autonomous driving simulation benchmarks.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble method with segmentation preprocessing effectively balances accuracy and speed for real-world deployment, demonstrating strong potential for early skin cancer detection.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

*Ji Song,Xing Wang,Jianguo Wu,Xiaowei Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBSD method for efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds, using texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic patterns and reduce misidentification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations when applied to textured defect images, including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale structured datasets.

Method: Texture Basis integrated Smooth Decomposition (TBSD) approach with two principal processes: 1) learning texture basis functions to extract quasi-periodic texture patterns, 2) using texture basis as prior knowledge for anomaly detection to prevent texture misidentification.

Result: The method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD provides an effective solution for anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds, addressing key limitations of conventional methods through mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and texture basis integration.

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Incorporating physically inferred joint actuation forces into motion understanding pipelines consistently improves performance across gait recognition, action recognition, and video captioning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing vision-based motion understanding methods overlook fundamental physical cues like joint actuation forces from biomechanics, creating a gap in understanding whether and when these forces enhance motion analysis.

Method: Incorporated physically inferred forces into established motion understanding pipelines and systematically evaluated their impact across baseline models on three major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning.

Result: Across 8 benchmarks, force incorporation yielded consistent performance gains: gait recognition improved by +0.87% on CASIA-B (with larger gains under challenging conditions: +2.7% wearing coat, +3.0% side view), +1.3% on Gait3D; action recognition improved by +2.00% on Penn Action (+6.96% for high-exertion classes); video captioning ROUGE-L score increased from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029).

Conclusion: Force cues substantially complement visual and kinematic features, particularly under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions, demonstrating the value of incorporating physical biomechanical information into motion understanding systems.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text-to-image models have limited text rendering performance, especially for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, creating a need for better AI-assisted graphic design tools.

Method: Proposes a DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on synthetic data to generate transparent RGBA text foregrounds, extended into a conditional text generation framework with multi-modal condition encoder, integrated into a fully automated text-to-design pipeline with pre-trained T2I models and MLLM-based layout planner.

Result: UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in stylistic consistency and text accuracy, with unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed UTDesign framework effectively addresses limitations in text rendering for AI-assisted graphic design, providing a unified solution for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation across multiple scripts.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

*James E. Gallagher,Edward J. Oughton,Jana Kosecka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates adaptive RGB and LWIR fusion for UAS-based landmine detection, finding YOLOv11 with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude achieves optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with significant tradeoffs between accuracy and training efficiency across different architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Landmines pose a major humanitarian threat with 110 million deployed mines causing 26,000 annual casualties. The research aims to improve detection using thermal contrast between mines and surrounding soil via UAS-based systems.

Method: Used adaptive RGB and LWIR fusion with YOLO architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images (35,640 evaluations). Compared multiple detection architectures including RF-DETR, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet. Tested multi-temporal vs season-specific training datasets and evaluated performance for different mine types (AT vs AP).

Result: YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP) with 10-30% thermal fusion at 5-10m altitude. RF-DETR had highest accuracy (69.2% mAP) but YOLOv11 trained 17.7x faster. Multi-temporal datasets outperformed season-specific by 1.8-9.6%. AT mines detected at 61.9% vs AP mines at 19.2%.

Conclusion: Adaptive thermal fusion significantly improves landmine detection, with YOLOv11 offering the best balance of accuracy and efficiency. Multi-temporal training enhances robustness, but detection performance varies significantly by mine type. Future work should examine buried mines and heterogeneous soil conditions.

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

TL;DR: SirenPose is a novel method for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos that combines sinusoidal representation networks with geometric supervision and physics-inspired constraints to achieve accurate, temporally consistent results even in challenging scenarios with fast motion and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. There's a need for better dynamic 3D reconstruction that maintains temporal consistency and geometric accuracy.

Method: SirenPose integrates periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) with keypoint-based geometric supervision. It incorporates physics-inspired constraints for coherent keypoint predictions across spatial and temporal dimensions, leverages high-frequency signal modeling for fine-grained details, expands the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances, and uses graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations.

Result: SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS. On DAVIS, it achieves 17.8% reduction in FVD, 28.7% reduction in FID, and 6.0% improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also shows improvements in temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, it outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error and reduced translational/rotational relative pose error.

Conclusion: SirenPose effectively handles rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction by combining sinusoidal representation networks with geometric supervision and physics constraints, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignPose is a multi-view 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates RGB information from calibrated cameras without object-specific training, using novel multi-view feature-metric refinement to overcome single-view limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view RGB pose estimation suffers from depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view methods could solve these issues but existing approaches either rely on precise single-view estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects.

Method: AlignPose aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views without object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Key innovation is multi-view feature-metric refinement that optimizes a single consistent world-frame object pose by minimizing feature discrepancy between rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using BOP benchmark show AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available.

Conclusion: AlignPose effectively addresses limitations of single-view pose estimation through multi-view aggregation and novel refinement, demonstrating superior performance particularly in industrial applications where multiple camera views are practical.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

*Mingwei Tang,Jiahao Nie,Guang Yang,Ziqing Cui,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTIF introduces multi-grained textual descriptions and hierarchical cross-modal modulation to improve image fusion quality by better aligning visual and textual features at different detail levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-guided image fusion methods use coarse-grained descriptions that fail to capture fine details and struggle with precise cross-modal alignment, limiting fusion quality for challenging conditions like varying exposure or focus.

Method: Proposes MTIF with three key designs: 1) multi-grained textual descriptions capturing fine details, structural cues, and semantic content; 2) hierarchical cross-modal modulation with supervision at each granularity; 3) saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content.

Result: Extensive experiments show MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Conclusion: MTIF successfully addresses limitations of coarse-grained text guidance by introducing multi-grained descriptions and hierarchical alignment, achieving superior fusion performance across different challenging imaging conditions.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashVLM is a text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to queries, achieving beyond lossless compression by pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens while slightly surpassing unpruned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image/video frame, incurring quadratic attention costs and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore textual queries or rely on unstable attention maps that degrade semantic alignment under aggressive pruning.

Method: FlashVLM computes explicit cross-modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in language model space, fuses this extrinsic relevance with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature-controlled sharpening, and includes a diversity-preserving partition to retain minimal yet representative background tokens for global context.

Result: Achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8% of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, maintaining 92.8% accuracy even under 94.4% compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image/video benchmarks show state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs with strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Conclusion: FlashVLM provides an effective text-guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to queries, enabling substantial token reduction while maintaining or improving performance, addressing key limitations of existing token reduction methods in vision-language models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: DiTracker adapts pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers for point tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks with 8x smaller batch size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking methods use shallow convolutional backbones that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching under challenging conditions like dynamic motions and occlusions.

Method: Adapts pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with ResNet backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches/outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks despite training with 8 times smaller batch size.

Conclusion: Video Diffusion Transformers pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos exhibit strong point tracking capability and can serve as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking tasks.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD improves federated learning efficiency by including outlier participants, eliminating dependency on previous rounds, and using validation loss calculation, achieving comparable performance to FedPIDAvg while being compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedPIDAvg has limitations: it excludes outlier participants based on Poisson distribution, limiting data utilization, and requires maintaining the same participants throughout training due to PID controller dependency on previous rounds' information.

Method: FedPOD includes participants excluded as outliers, eliminates dependency on previous rounds' learning information, applies validation loss calculation at each round, and is designed as round-wise tasks compatible with Kubernetes POD units for flexible auto-scaling.

Result: FedPOD achieves comparable performance to FedPIDAvg with Dice scores of 0.78, 0.71, and 0.72 for WT, ET, and TC respectively, and projected convergence score of 0.74 on average.

Conclusion: FedPOD demonstrates potential to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance metrics, with Kubernetes-inspired design enabling scalable deployment.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: ORCA framework enables video avatars to autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction using a closed-loop OTAR cycle and hierarchical dual-system architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar generation methods lack genuine agency and cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. They excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but are passive rather than active.

Method: ORCA framework with Internal World Model capabilities: (1) closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) for robust state tracking under generative uncertainty, and (2) hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning while System 1 translates plans into precise action captions. Formulates avatar control as a POMDP with continuous belief updating and outcome verification.

Result: ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence. Enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: ORCA advances video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior by implementing Internal World Model-inspired design for genuine agency and long-term goal pursuit.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: SpatialTree introduces a cognitive-science-inspired 4-level hierarchy for spatial abilities in MLLMs, creates a hierarchical benchmark, reveals transfer dynamics, and proposes auto-think strategy for consistent improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLM studies focus on narrow spatial tasks without understanding the hierarchical development of spatial abilities from perception to reasoning, which cognitive science suggests develops progressively.

Method: Proposed SpatialTree taxonomy with 4 levels (perception, mental mapping, simulation, agentic competence), constructed hierarchical benchmark with 27 sub-abilities, evaluated mainstream MLLMs, conducted targeted fine-tuning experiments, and developed auto-think strategy for RL optimization.

Result: Evaluation revealed clear structure: L1 skills are orthogonal while higher-level skills are strongly correlated. Fine-tuning showed negative transfer within L1 but strong cross-level transfer from low to high abilities. Naive RL helps complex reasoning but hurts perception, while auto-think strategy enables consistent improvement across all levels.

Conclusion: SpatialTree provides a framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs, demonstrating hierarchical organization, transfer dynamics, and effective optimization strategies for comprehensive spatial intelligence development.

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen is a two-stage video generation method that first generates compact semantic features for global planning, then adds high-frequency details, improving convergence speed and computational efficiency for long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generative models using VAE latent space suffer from slow convergence and high computational costs for long videos due to directly modeling low-level video tokens with bi-directional attention.

Method: Two-stage generation: 1) Diffusion model generates compact semantic video features for global layout planning, 2) Another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on semantic features to produce final output.

Result: SemanticGen achieves faster convergence than VAE latent space generation, is computationally efficient for long videos, and produces high-quality videos that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Generating videos in semantic space with a two-stage approach addresses limitations of current methods, offering improved convergence speed, computational efficiency, and video quality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

### [68] [HARMON-E: Hierarchical Agentic Reasoning for Multimodal Oncology Notes to Extract Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19864)
*Shashi Kant Gupta,Arijeet Pramanik,Jerrin John Thomas,Regina Schwind,Lauren Wiener,Avi Raju,Jeremy Kornbluth,Yanshan Wang,Zhaohui Su,Hrituraj Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based agentic framework achieves high accuracy (F1=0.93) for extracting structured oncology data from 400k+ unstructured EHR notes, significantly reducing manual annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured EHR notes contain valuable oncology data but are challenging to extract due to variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent formats. Manual abstraction is costly, while existing automated approaches are too narrow and don't handle patient-level synthesis across contradictory documents.

Method: Proposed an agentic framework using LLMs as reasoning agents with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities. Systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks to extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes.

Result: Achieved average F1-score of 0.93 on 400,000+ unstructured notes from 2,250 cancer patients. 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeded F1 of 0.85, with critical variables (biomarkers, medications) surpassing 0.95. Integration into workflow resulted in 0.94 manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs.

Conclusion: First exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale, demonstrating high accuracy and cost-effectiveness for real-world clinical data curation.

Abstract: Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale

*Kirk Vanacore,Rene F. Kizilcec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show moderate baseline performance for classifying instructional moves in classroom transcripts, with few-shot prompting significantly improving results but not eliminating reliability limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become widely adopted in educational technologies, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities without customization is important for setting expectations and benchmarking in authentic academic contexts.

Method: Compared six LLMs on classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts using typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, evaluated against expert-coded annotations.

Result: Zero-shot performance was moderate; few-shot prompting significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models (best configuration reached Cohen's Kappa = 0.58). Performance varied by instructional move, and higher recall came at the cost of increased false positives.

Conclusion: Foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.

### [70] [Counterfactual LLM-based Framework for Measuring Rhetorical Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19908)
*Jingyi Qiu,Hong Chen,Zongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based framework quantifies rhetorical style in ML papers, showing visionary framing predicts attention and post-2023 rhetorical strength increase driven by LLM writing assistance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to distinguish between substantive content and rhetorical style in ML papers, as bold language could reflect either strong results or hype, but existing methods can't reliably quantify rhetorical style independently of content.

Method: Counterfactual LLM framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate alternative writings from same content, LLM judge compares via pairwise evaluations, aggregated using Bradley-Terry model; applied to 8,485 ICLR submissions (2017-2025) generating 250k+ counterfactuals.

Result: Visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention (citations/media) even after controlling for peer review; sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023 driven by LLM writing assistance; framework validated by robustness to persona choice and high LLM-human correlation.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation by quantifying rhetorical style independently of content, revealing how writing style influences attention and detecting LLM-assisted writing trends.

Abstract: The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.

*Heet Bodara,Md Masum Mushfiq,Isma Farah Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates tone bias in Large Language Models used in conversational AI, revealing systematic tonal skew even in supposedly neutral outputs, and develops classification methods to detect these biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in conversational systems like digital assistants, but their responses often carry subtle tone biases (overly polite, cheerful, cautious) even when neutrality is expected, which can influence user perceptions of trust, empathy, and fairness.

Method: Researchers created two synthetic dialogue datasets (neutral prompts and tone-guided prompts), used weak supervision with pretrained DistilBERT to label tones, and trained multiple classifiers including ensemble models to detect tone patterns.

Result: Even the neutral dataset showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting bias stems from the model's underlying conversational style. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, demonstrating that tone bias is systematic and measurable.

Conclusion: Tone bias represents a hidden behavioral trait in LLMs that is relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI, and the proposed methodology enables robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in conversational systems such as digital personal assistants, shaping how people interact with technology through language. While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ThinkARM framework abstracts LLM reasoning traces into functional steps (Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify) using Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, enabling systematic analysis of reasoning structure and dynamics in mathematical problem solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models expose reasoning traces but their underlying cognitive structure remains difficult to analyze beyond surface-level statistics. Current approaches lack intermediate-scale analysis of functional reasoning steps.

Method: Introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps based on Schoenfeld's Episode Theory. Applied to mathematical problem solving across diverse models to analyze thinking dynamics and structural differences.

Result: Reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models not apparent from token-level views. Exploration functions as critical branching step associated with correctness. Efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

Conclusion: Episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models, providing deeper insights into model cognition beyond surface statistics.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly expose reasoning traces, yet their underlying cognitive structure and steps remain difficult to identify and analyze beyond surface-level statistics. We adopt Schoenfeld's Episode Theory as an inductive, intermediate-scale lens and introduce ThinkARM (Anatomy of Reasoning in Models), a scalable framework that explicitly abstracts reasoning traces into functional reasoning steps such as Analysis, Explore, Implement, Verify, etc. When applied to mathematical problem solving by diverse models, this abstraction reveals reproducible thinking dynamics and structural differences between reasoning and non-reasoning models, which are not apparent from token-level views. We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses. Together, our results demonstrate that episode-level representations make reasoning steps explicit, enabling systematic analysis of how reasoning is structured, stabilized, and altered in modern language models.

*Yiming Du,Baojun Wang,Yifan Xiang,Zhaowei Wang,Wenyu Huang,Boyang Xue,Bin Liang,Xingshan Zeng,Fei Mi,Haoli Bai,Lifeng Shang,Jeff Z. Pan,Yuxin Jiang,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Memory-T1 is a reinforcement learning framework for temporal reasoning in long multi-session dialogues that uses a coarse-to-fine memory selection policy with temporal consistency rewards to improve performance on noisy, lengthy dialogue histories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current long-context models struggle with temporal reasoning in lengthy, noisy multi-session dialogues, failing to accurately identify temporally pertinent information as dialogue histories grow, which significantly impairs reasoning performance.

Method: Memory-T1 learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first pruning dialogue history using temporal and relevance filters, then using an RL agent to select precise evidence sessions. Training uses a multi-level reward function optimizing answer accuracy, evidence grounding, and temporal consistency (with session-level chronological proximity and utterance-level chronological fidelity).

Result: On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to 67.0% overall score, establishing new SOTA for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2%. Ablation shows temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards contribute 15.0% performance gain. The framework maintains robustness up to 128k tokens where baselines collapse.

Conclusion: Memory-T1 effectively addresses temporal reasoning challenges in long multi-session dialogues through RL-based memory selection with temporal consistency rewards, demonstrating superior performance, robustness to noise, and scalability to extensive dialogue histories.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Memory-T1/

### [74] [A Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20097)
*Zuo Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TextGSL is a novel graph-sequence learning model for inductive text classification that combines diverse structural relationships (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics) with sequential information using adaptive multi-edge message passing and Transformer layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based text classification approaches have two major limitations: 1) they fail to fully consider diverse structural information across word pairs (co-occurrence, syntax, semantics), and 2) they neglect sequence information in text graph structure learning and cannot handle texts with new words and relations (inductive setting).

Method: TextGSL constructs a single text-level graph for each text with different edge types based on diverse word pair relationships. It uses an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information and incorporates Transformer layers to capture sequential information, enabling inductive text classification.

Result: Experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets show that TextGSL outperforms several strong baselines in terms of accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for inductive text classification.

Conclusion: TextGSL successfully addresses the limitations of existing GNN-based text classification by jointly modeling diverse structural relationships and sequential information, leading to more discriminative text representations and better performance in inductive settings.

Abstract: Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.

*Aly Lidayan,Jakob Bjorner,Satvik Golechha,Kartik Goyal,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ABBEL framework enables LLM agents to maintain concise contexts via belief states instead of full interaction histories, with RL post-training improving performance beyond full context while using less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As sequential decision-making tasks grow longer, keeping full interaction histories becomes computationally impractical. There's a need for methods that maintain concise contexts while preserving performance.

Method: ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history with a belief state (natural language summary of task-relevant unknowns). At each step, the agent updates prior belief with recent observation to form posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select actions. RL post-training with belief grading (rewarding quality) and belief length penalties (rewarding compression) further improves performance.

Result: ABBEL supports interpretable beliefs with near-constant memory use across six diverse multi-step environments. However, bottleneck approaches suffer from error propagation, causing inferior performance compared to full context. RL training improves ABBEL's performance beyond full context setting while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

Conclusion: ABBEL provides a framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through belief states, with RL post-training overcoming error propagation limitations and achieving superior performance with reduced memory requirements compared to full context approaches.

Abstract: As the length of sequential decision-making tasks increases, it becomes computationally impractical to keep full interaction histories in context. We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.

TL;DR: M³KG-RAG: A multi-hop multimodal knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system that improves audio-visual reasoning in MLLMs by constructing enriched multimodal knowledge graphs and using grounded retrieval with selective pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal RAG systems face limitations in audio-visual domains due to: 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity in existing multimodal knowledge graphs, and 2) similarity-based retrieval that fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge, leading to suboptimal reasoning and answer faithfulness.

Method: Proposes M³KG-RAG with two key components: 1) A lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop multimodal knowledge graphs (M³KG) containing context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval. 2) GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning) that ensures precise entity grounding to queries, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only essential knowledge for response generation.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M³KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding capabilities over existing approaches, showing improved reasoning depth and answer faithfulness.

Conclusion: M³KG-RAG addresses key limitations in multimodal RAG systems by constructing enriched multimodal knowledge graphs with better connectivity and implementing grounded retrieval with selective pruning, leading to substantial improvements in audio-visual reasoning performance for MLLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.

Motivation: Existing iterative RAG systems plan question decomposition without considering available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and cascading errors in multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA) module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems, using contextually relevant retrieved knowledge to establish stronger reasoning foundation.

Result: Significant improvements in retrieval precision, reduced cascading errors, enhanced performance and efficiency across six standard RAG datasets; reduces unnecessary exploration during reasoning from entropy perspective.

Conclusion: EKA advances state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems, demonstrating critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks as a versatile, training-free inference strategy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

TL;DR: RetroPrompt is a novel prompt learning approach that decouples knowledge from memorization by incorporating retrieval from a knowledge base to enhance generalization in few-shot learning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt learning for pre-trained foundation models follows parametric learning paradigms that compromise generalization stability, struggle with atypical instances, and risk overfitting to shallow patterns in limited data settings.

Method: RetroPrompt decouples knowledge from memorization by leveraging a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from training data and incorporating retrieval mechanisms throughout input, training, and inference stages to actively retrieve relevant contextual information.

Result: Comprehensive experiments across NLP and computer vision tasks demonstrate superior performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, with analysis showing reduced reliance on rote memorization and enhanced generalization.

Conclusion: RetroPrompt effectively balances memorization and generalization by incorporating retrieval mechanisms, offering a promising approach to improve few-shot learning performance in pre-trained foundation models.

Abstract: The pre-trained foundation models (PFMs) have become essential for facilitating large-scale multimodal learning. Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fun-Audio-Chat is a Large Audio Language Model that solves speech-text temporal mismatch and catastrophic forgetting via dual-resolution representations and core-cocktail training, achieving competitive performance on audio tasks while retaining text LLM knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing joint speech-text models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge.

Method: 1) Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz via token grouping, while Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz. 2) Core-Cocktail Training: Two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. 3) Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy.

Result: Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They show competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. A full-duplex variant also performs well.

Conclusion: Fun-Audio-Chat successfully addresses temporal resolution mismatch and catastrophic forgetting through innovative architectural and training approaches, achieving strong audio capabilities while preserving text LLM knowledge without requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo.

*Honglin Mu,Jinghao Liu,Kaiyang Wan,Rui Xing,Xiuying Chen,Timothy Baldwin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial instructions hidden in input data like resumes, with attack success rates over 80% in resume screening. Training-time defenses (FIDS) outperform inference-time mitigations, with combined approaches achieving 26.3% attack reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for automated tasks like resume screening, but they can be manipulated by adversarial instructions hidden in input data, causing them to deviate from intended tasks. While defenses exist for mature domains like code review, they are often absent in other applications like resume screening and peer review.

Method: The paper introduces a benchmark to assess LLM vulnerability in resume screening. It evaluates two defense mechanisms: 1) prompt-based defenses (inference-time), and 2) FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation (training-time). The combined approach is also tested.

Result: Attack success rates exceed 80% for certain attack types in resume screening. Prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase. FIDS achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction.

Conclusion: Training-time defenses (FIDS) outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation. The vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial instructions in applications like resume screening is significant, and effective defenses require training-time adaptations rather than just prompt-based mitigations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text comprehension and generation, making them ideal for automated tasks like code review and content moderation. However, our research identifies a vulnerability: LLMs can be manipulated by "adversarial instructions" hidden in input data, such as resumes or code, causing them to deviate from their intended task. Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase. The combined approach provides 26.3% attack reduction, demonstrating that training-time defenses outperform inference-time mitigations in both security and utility preservation.

Conclusion: FaithLens provides a cost-efficient, effective solution for faithfulness hallucination detection that combines binary predictions with high-quality explanations, offering superior performance compared to larger models while maintaining trustworthiness and efficiency.

Abstract: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

TL;DR: Corpus of cross-lingual dialogues with speech translation, plus method for detecting misunderstandings using LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for realistic evaluation corpus to assess automatic systems for meetings between people without common languages, facilitated by speech translation technology.

Method: Created corpus of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR transcripts in 12 languages and English translations; proposed automatic misunderstanding detection by manually annotating misunderstandings and testing LLMs (Gemini) for detection.

Result: Gemini model achieved 77% recall and 47% precision in identifying text spans with misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings.

Conclusion: Presented valuable corpus for cross-lingual dialogue research and demonstrated LLMs' potential for automatic misunderstanding detection, though precision needs improvement.

Abstract: Speech processing and translation technology have the potential to facilitate meetings of individuals who do not share any common language. To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.
  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically. The results show that the Gemini model is able to identify text spans with misunderstandings with recall of 77% and precision of 47%.

*Wenzheng Zeng,Mingyu Ouyang,Langyuan Cui,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SlideTailor: A human-inspired agentic framework for personalized paper-to-slides generation using user-provided examples and templates instead of detailed textual preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic slide generation systems produce suboptimal results because they don't account for individual user preferences, which vary significantly between users. Current approaches are under-specified and fail to align with specific user needs.

Method: SlideTailor uses a human behavior-inspired agentic framework that progressively generates editable slides. It requires only a paper-slides example pair and visual template (natural artifacts that implicitly encode user preferences) instead of detailed textual specifications. The framework includes a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration.

Result: The framework effectively distills and generalizes implicit user preferences despite unlabeled inputs. It significantly enhances slide quality and enables downstream applications like video presentations. A benchmark dataset with interpretable metrics was created for evaluation, and extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SlideTailor provides an effective solution for personalized slide generation by leveraging implicit user preferences through example pairs and templates, overcoming limitations of traditional under-specified approaches while enabling better alignment with individual user needs.

Abstract: Automatic presentation slide generation can greatly streamline content creation. However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: Current moderation tools treat safety risks and adversarial threats as separate problems, limiting robustness and generalizability as LLMs are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings.

Method: AprielGuard is trained on diverse open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces for interpretability within a unified taxonomy and learning framework.

Result: AprielGuard achieves strong performance across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, outperforming existing open-source guardrails like Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning-intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: By releasing the model, the authors aim to advance transparent and reproducible research on reliable safeguards for LLMs, providing a unified approach to safety and adversarial threat detection.

Abstract: Safeguarding large language models (LLMs) against unsafe or adversarial behavior is critical as they are increasingly deployed in conversational and agentic settings. Existing moderation tools often treat safety risks (e.g. toxicity, bias) and adversarial threats (e.g. prompt injections, jailbreaks) as separate problems, limiting their robustness and generalizability. We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform mental health professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy for personality disorders using Polish autobiographical narratives, but show severe bias in underdiagnosing Narcissistic Personality Disorder due to reluctance toward the term "narcissism."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capability of LLMs in psychiatric self-assessment by comparing their diagnostic performance against mental health professionals when interpreting qualitative patient narratives for Borderline and Narcissistic Personality Disorders.

Method: Direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals using Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts, evaluating diagnostic accuracy, F1 scores, and qualitative analysis of diagnostic justifications.

Result: Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals by 21.91 percentage points in overall accuracy (65.48% vs 43.57%). Both performed well on BPD (F1=83.4 vs 80.0), but models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1=6.7 vs 50.0), showing bias against the term "narcissism." Models provided confident, elaborate justifications while humans were concise and cautious.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate high competence in interpreting complex clinical data but suffer from critical reliability and bias issues, particularly in value-laden diagnoses like narcissism, highlighting both their potential and limitations for psychiatric applications.

Abstract: Growing reliance on LLMs for psychiatric self-assessment raises questions about their ability to interpret qualitative patient narratives. We present the first direct comparison between state-of-the-art LLMs and mental health professionals in diagnosing Borderline (BPD) and Narcissistic (NPD) Personality Disorders utilizing Polish-language first-person autobiographical accounts. We show that the top-performing Gemini Pro models surpassed human professionals in overall diagnostic accuracy by 21.91 percentage points (65.48% vs. 43.57%). While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term "narcissism." Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates by extracting semantic representations from speech, addressing the need for efficient textless spoken language modeling.

Method: Self-supervised model trained on raw waveforms using masked prediction objective with self-distillation and online clustering; intermediate student layers predict assignments from teacher's intermediate layers to stabilize clustering and improve codebook quality.

Result: Outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC); establishes correlation between speech unit quality metrics (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance; reduces pretraining time from a week to one day on 16 GPUs.

Conclusion: SpidR provides high-quality phonetic-rich speech representations for textless language modeling with significantly reduced training time, enabling faster experimentation and advancing speech-based language learning without text.

Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored ability of LLMs to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings, particularly for Bangla language, by creating a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative reasoning capabilities.

Method: Created BanglaRiddleEval with 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles across four tasks (4,976 artifacts total). Used LLM-based pipeline to generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations. Evaluated diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies.

Result: Models achieved moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness. MCQ accuracy peaked at only about 56% versus 83% human baseline. Ambiguity resolution ranged from roughly 26% to 68%. High-quality explanations were confined to the strongest models.

Conclusion: Current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning. All resources are publicly available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive performance on many NLP benchmarks, yet their ability to reason in figurative, culturally grounded, and low-resource settings remains underexplored. We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models.

Abstract: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch.

TL;DR: Simple layer selection method using importance scores from generic text data to convert softmax attention layers to linear attention in Transformers, combined with RADLADS distillation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve inference efficiency of LLMs by distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into hybrid architectures without expensive pretraining, requiring effective layer selection methods.

Method: Uses layer importance scores derived from small amount of training on generic text data for layer selection, then applies RADLADS distillation pipeline (attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, and fine-tuning).

Result: More effective than existing approaches including uniform interleaving based on fixed ratios and methods using specialized diagnostic datasets.

Conclusion: Simple and efficient layer selection recipe using generic text data training outperforms existing methods for converting softmax attention layers to linear attention in hybrid Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Distilling pretrained softmax attention Transformers into more efficient hybrid architectures that interleave softmax and linear attention layers is a promising approach for improving the inference efficiency of LLMs without requiring expensive pretraining from scratch. A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.

### [91] [Can LLMs Predict Their Own Failures? Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20578)
*Amirhosein Ghasemabadi,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gnosis is a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to predict their own failures by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns during inference, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs generate fluent outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. The paper asks whether LLMs can predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference.

Method: Gnosis passively observes internal traces (hidden states and attention patterns), compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost. It adds only ~5M parameters and operates independently of sequence length, enabling intrinsic self-verification without modifying the frozen LLM backbone.

Result: Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. It also generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories.

Conclusion: Reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to the generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision. Gnosis demonstrates that LLMs can perform effective self-verification by analyzing their own internal states during inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.

*Dhruv Anand,Ehsan Shareghi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Cube Bench is a Rubik's Cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal LLMs, testing five core skills across scramble depths, revealing performance drops with complexity and a closed vs open-source gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a standardized benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models using Rubik's Cube as a testbed, addressing the need for reproducible assessment of complex reasoning skills.

Method: Developed Cube Bench benchmark with five decomposed skills: cube face reconstruction, optimal move selection, move outcome prediction, multi-step plan execution with error recovery, and error detection/revision. Used shared scrambled cube states, identical prompts/parsers, and single distance-to-solved metric across seven MLLMs at varying scramble depths.

Result: Accuracy drops sharply with scramble depth; models rarely recover from stalled/diverged trajectories; high face reconstruction doesn't guarantee competent action selection; pronounced closed vs open-source gap exists; best closed model leads on both perception and control tasks; open-weight models cluster near chance on hardest settings; even best MLLM degrades with cube complexity; self-correction yields modest gains but can cause overthinking.

Conclusion: Cube Bench provides a compact, reproducible probe for sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs, revealing significant limitations in current models' ability to handle complex spatial reasoning tasks, especially as difficulty increases, with clear performance gaps between closed and open-source models.

Abstract: We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: Existing LLM systems are limited to well-defined benchmarks and general tasks, lacking end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios, particularly in physics which requires abstract reasoning, mathematical intensity, and integration of analytical reasoning with code-based computation.

Method: PhysMaster couples abstract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU (Layered Academic Data Universe) which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces.

Conclusion: PhysMaster represents an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist, capable of robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks through its integration of reasoning, computation, knowledge management, and adaptive exploration strategies.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios.

*Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,F. Sibel Salman,Walter J. Gutjahr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bi-objective optimization for post-disaster relief distribution balancing fairness (Gini-index) and efficiency (travel time) using branch-and-price algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster relief distribution often faces shortages where prepositioned supplies can't meet all demands, requiring careful planning to balance efficiency and equity in aid delivery.

Method: Formulated bi-objective MIP model minimizing Gini-index-based inequity and total travel time, used ε-constraint method, derived mathematical properties for valid inequalities, developed branch-and-price algorithm with optimal delivery allocation for given routes.

Result: Branch-and-price algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers, reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency; lexicographic optimization works for extreme time constraints, balanced approach needed for moderate constraints.

Conclusion: The bi-objective approach effectively balances fairness and efficiency in relief distribution; algorithm performance is validated on real earthquake data; strategic approach selection depends on time constraint tightness.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

*Eric Yeh,John Cadigan,Ran Chen,Dick Crouch,Melinda Gervasio,Dayne Freitag*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can simulate human behavior in economic games using interpolative decoding to represent personality dimensions, enabling systematic testing of personality effects on decision-making without creating individual prompts for each profile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the experimental overhead and replicability issues in using LLMs as human proxies for studying personality effects on decision-making, where creating separate prompts for each personality profile is inefficient.

Method: Use interpolative decoding to represent each Big Five personality dimension as a pair of opposed prompts with an interpolation parameter, allowing systematic simulation of behavior along personality continua.

Result: Interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along Big Five dimensions, causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making in economic games, and enables "twinning" of individual human players through systematic search in interpolation space.

Conclusion: Interpolative decoding provides an efficient, systematic approach for using LLMs to simulate human personality effects on decision-making, improving experimental efficiency and replicability while maintaining behavioral fidelity.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge of fine-grained multi-label species identification from high-resolution vegetation plot images, requiring adaptation from individual species classification to multi-label classification.

Method: Extracts class prototypes from training data using K-Means clustering (K=number of classes), trains a customized narrow ViT with frozen DinoV2 patch embedding to reconstruct prototypes from test images, uses attention scores for localization and classification guidance.

Result: Achieved 5th place in PlantCLEF 2025 challenge with F1 score of 0.33331, only 0.03 lower than top-performing submission, demonstrating competitive performance.

Conclusion: The prototype-guided segmentation ViT approach enables effective domain adaptation for multi-label species identification, showing competitive results in the PlantCLEF benchmark.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

*Luciano Araujo Dourado Filho,Rodrigo Tripodi Calumby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization that uses class-wise clustering to discover pseudo-labels encoding latent similarity, enabling hierarchical classification to learn fine-grained features and mitigate intra-class variability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intra-class variability in fine-grained visual categorization tasks can hinder deep learning models, especially when combined with class underrepresentation. The paper aims to address this challenge by developing a method that can better handle intra-class dissimilarities.

Method: The method applies clustering over each class individually to discover pseudo-labels that encode latent similarity between images. These pseudo-labels are then used in a hierarchical classification process to learn more fine-grained visual features, thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset, even though some components haven't been fully optimized. Initial experiments revealed several key points requiring future development for more conclusive evidence of effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical classification approach using class-wise clustering shows promise for improving fine-grained visual categorization by addressing intra-class variability, though further optimization and validation are needed.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

TL;DR: S³IT benchmark evaluates embodied social intelligence through seat-ordering tasks requiring integration of social norms and physical constraints in 3D environments with LLM-driven NPCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations fail to address the integration of social reasoning and physical constraints in embodied agents, being limited to either disembodied social reasoning or socially-agnostic physical tasks.

Method: Introduces Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S³IT) benchmark with procedurally extensible framework generating diverse seat-ordering scenarios where agents must acquire preferences through dialogue, explore environments, and perform multi-objective optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with S³IT tasks, showing deficiencies in spatial intelligence but achieving near human-level competence in resolving conflicts with explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: S³IT reveals gaps in LLMs' embodied social intelligence, highlighting the need for better integration of spatial and social reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

TL;DR: LieFlow: A method for discovering symmetries from data using flow matching on Lie groups, learning distributions over hypothesis groups to match observed symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is fundamental in physics and improves ML performance, but requires knowledge of underlying symmetries in data. Current methods lack flexibility and make too many assumptions about group types.

Method: Formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group via flow matching on Lie groups. Introduce novel interpolation scheme to address "last-minute convergence" challenge where symmetric target modes cause samples to remain stationary until late in flow.

Result: Successful discovery of discrete groups including reflections by flow matching over complex domain, demonstrated on 2D and 3D point clouds. Method is more flexible than previous works and requires fewer assumptions.

Conclusion: LieFlow enables direct learning of symmetries from data through flow matching on Lie groups, addressing key challenges in symmetry discovery with improved flexibility and reduced assumptions.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

TL;DR: SOF learns latent skills from action-free videos using optical flow as an intermediate representation, enabling high-level planning and easier translation to robot actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video learning offers rich visual priors for robots, but existing video generative models are hard to translate into actions, while latent-action models lack high-level planning capabilities. There's a need to bridge this gap.

Method: SOF learns latent skills from large action-free video collections using optical flow as an intermediate representation. This flow-based latent space captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions, enabling skill learning and composition.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvements in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Conclusion: SOF successfully bridges the gap between video learning and robot action by using optical flow as an intermediate representation for skill abstraction, enabling effective skill acquisition and composition from visual data.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

TL;DR: ProbGLC: A probabilistic cross-view geolocalization approach for rapid disaster response that combines probabilistic and deterministic models to enhance accuracy and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change is increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, requiring rapid response. Accurate and quick identification of disaster locations is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation in disaster response.

Method: Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization (ProbGLC) framework that combines probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models. It addresses cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events and provides probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Result: Superior geolocalization accuracy: 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km on MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster datasets. Enhanced model explainability through probabilistic distributions and localizability scores.

Conclusion: ProbGLC demonstrates great potential for leveraging generative cross-view approaches to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: RL-based content moderation scales efficiently, achieving expert-level accuracy with 100x data efficiency over supervised methods, particularly effective for complex policy reasoning in sparse-label settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the practical challenges of training LLMs for content moderation at scale, especially in real-world settings with label sparsity, evolving policies, and need for nuanced reasoning beyond pattern matching.

Method: Comprehensive empirical investigation using reinforcement learning with multiple training recipes and reward-shaping strategies (verifiable rewards, LLM-as-judge frameworks) to transform general-purpose LLMs into specialized policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world moderation tasks.

Result: RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior with smooth performance improvements before saturation; achieves up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning; substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning.

Conclusion: RL is particularly effective for industrial-scale moderation systems in domains with scarce expert annotations, providing actionable insights for practical implementation.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

TL;DR: Reason2Decide is a two-stage training framework that improves clinical decision support by generating accurate predictions with aligned explanations, addressing exposure bias and reducing reliance on human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical decision support systems need both high predictive accuracy and explanations that align with predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations between predictions and rationales.

Method: Two-stage training framework: Stage-1 trains on rationale generation; Stage-2 jointly trains on label prediction and rationale generation using scheduled sampling to transition from gold labels to model predictions.

Result: Outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity across three medical datasets. Achieves rationale source-robustness across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. Works with models 40x smaller than foundation models.

Conclusion: Reason2Decide addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, reduces reliance on human annotations by using LLM-generated rationales, and makes clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

*Chaithra,Kamesh Kadimisetty,Biju R Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An adaptive framework combining LLMs with stock market feedback improves financial sentiment analysis by dynamically adjusting source reliability based on actual stock returns and using reinforcement learning for temporal adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis methods don't consider stock price impact or market feedback, limiting their real-world applicability for investment decisions and market risk assessment.

Method: Fine-tunes LLaMA 3.2 3B on SentiFin dataset using instruction-based learning, employs RAG pipeline with dynamic multi-source contextual selection via cosine similarity, introduces feedback-driven module comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day returns, and incorporates PPO reinforcement learning agent for temporal adaptation.

Result: Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines (2024-2025) show significant improvements in classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods.

Conclusion: Combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning enables robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling that adapts to real-world market behavior.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

*Zhuo Yang,Yeyun chen,Jiaqing Xie,Ben Gao,Shuaike Shen,Wanhao Liu,Liujia Yang,Beilun Wang,Tianfan Fu,Yuqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MolAct is an agentic reinforcement learning framework for molecular design that treats editing and optimization as sequential, tool-guided decisions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on validity and property optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular editing and optimization require iterative improvements while maintaining chemical validity and structural similarity, but existing approaches lack formalization as multi-step, tool-augmented processes with interpretable decision-making.

Method: Two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing learned editing behaviors. Uses LLM agents that interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization through multi-turn interactions with chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control.

Result: MolEditAgent-7B achieves 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming DeepSeek-R1. MolEditAgent-3B approaches Qwen3-32B-think performance. MolOptAgent-7B surpasses Claude 3.7 on LogP optimization and remains competitive on solubility while maintaining balanced performance across objectives.

Conclusion: Treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process enables reliable and interpretable improvements, establishing the first formalization of molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem with strong empirical results.

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

### [107] [Enhancing Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting in Off-the-Shelf LLMs via Noise Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20140)
*Xingyou Yin,Ceyao Zhang,Min Hu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Injecting noise into raw time series before tokenization improves zero-shot forecasting with frozen LLMs by forcing them to focus on robust temporal patterns rather than numerical artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot time series forecasting with frozen LLMs is brittle due to sensitivity to textual representations of numerical data, as model parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts.

Method: Inject noise into raw time series before tokenization as a non-invasive inference-time augmentation, forcing frozen LLMs to extrapolate based on robust temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts.

Result: Empirical validation across diverse benchmarks shows improved performance. Two novel time series datasets outside LLMs' pre-training scopes were introduced to eliminate data contamination biases, consistently showing performance gains.

Conclusion: Noise injection before tokenization is a simple yet effective strategy for improving zero-shot time series forecasting with frozen LLMs, advancing the paradigm of using off-the-shelf models without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data centers consume significant global energy and have large carbon footprints. With growing demand for edge computing and AI, improving energy efficiency through PUE prediction can reduce costs, combat climate change, and promote sustainability.

Method: Developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model for PUE prediction. Used EnergyPlus simulation data (52,560 samples, 117 features) from Singapore data center. Applied Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature selection. Compared BiGRU with standard GRU using MSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.

Result: The optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model showed superior performance compared to standard GRU model across all evaluation metrics (MSE, MAE, R-squared).

Conclusion: BiGRU model effectively predicts PUE, enabling targeted modifications of key features to improve data center energy efficiency and support sustainability goals.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

TL;DR: Humans outperform LLMs in concept inference tasks, showing flexible rule/similarity-based reasoning and better few-shot generalization from minimal examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand fundamental differences in how humans and large language models (LLMs) generalize and infer mathematical concepts, particularly in concept inference tasks like the number game.

Method: Used a Bayesian model as an analytical framework to compare human and LLM generalization in the number game, examining inductive biases and inference strategies through systematic comparison.

Result: Humans were better captured by the Bayesian model, showing flexible inference of both rule-based and similarity-based concepts, while LLMs relied more on mathematical rules. Humans demonstrated effective few-shot generalization from single examples, whereas LLMs required more samples.

Conclusion: There are fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts, with humans showing more flexible, sample-efficient reasoning compared to LLMs' rule-heavy approaches.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

*Ze Gong,Pradeep Varakantham,Akshat Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PreSa: A method for offline safe PbRL that learns safe policies directly from pairwise preferences and safety labels without explicit reward/cost models, avoiding constrained RL and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safe RLHF approaches learn reward/cost models from offline data then use constrained RL, but in long-horizon continuous control tasks, reward/cost errors accumulate and impair performance. Need direct policy learning from preferences and safety signals.

Method: Proposes PreSa: combines preference learning with safety alignment in constrained optimization solved via Lagrangian paradigm. Learns reward-maximizing safe policy directly from pairwise preferences (reward comparisons) and binary safety labels on trajectory segments, without explicitly learning reward/cost models.

Result: Empirical evaluation on continuous control tasks with synthetic and real human feedback shows method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward/cost.

Conclusion: Direct policy learning from preferences and safety labels (PreSa) effectively addresses error accumulation issues in long-horizon tasks, enabling safe offline PbRL without explicit reward/cost modeling or constrained RL, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Conclusion: TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence, bridging the gap in versatile simulation environments for embodied AI research.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

*Xingbo Du,Loka Li,Duzhen Zhang,Le Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR³ is an autonomous memory retrieval system for LLM agents that introduces closed-loop control with a router for retrieve/reflect/answer decisions and evidence-gap tracking, improving answer quality over standard retrieve-then-answer pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing memory systems for LLM agents focus too much on compression and storage optimization, with insufficient emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval processes.

Method: MemR³ features two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality, and 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that makes the answering process transparent and tracks evidence collection. This creates a closed-loop control system for autonomous decision-making.

Result: On the LoCoMo benchmark, MemR³ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, improving existing retrievers across four categories with overall improvements of +7.29% on RAG and +1.94% on Zep using GPT-4.1-mini backend.

Conclusion: MemR³ offers a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores that enables autonomous, accurate, and compatible memory retrieval through closed-loop control mechanisms, departing from standard retrieve-then-answer pipelines.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ActionFlow is a system-level inference framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action models on edge devices by 2.55x through cross-request pipelining and memory optimization, enabling real-time robotic control without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from high inference latency (3-5 Hz) on edge devices due to memory-bound autoregressive decoding, while smooth robotic interaction requires 20-30 Hz control frequencies. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise accuracy.

Method: ActionFlow introduces: 1) Cross-Request Pipelining strategy that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests, intelligently batching memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across time steps; 2) Cross-Request State Packed Forward operator; 3) Unified KV Ring Buffer to fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations.

Result: ActionFlow achieves 2.55x improvement in FPS on OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dynamic manipulation on edge hardware.

Conclusion: ActionFlow bridges the gap between VLA model capabilities and real-time robotic deployment requirements through system-level optimizations that maximize hardware utilization without compromising model accuracy or requiring retraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Result: Demonstrates that agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills by addressing these bottlenecks and applying the scientific methodology.

Conclusion: The approach enables LLMs to transition from passive tool-users to active workflow architects capable of autonomously synthesizing executable code skills from scratch, addressing key structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation.

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects.

TL;DR: Bohrium+SciMaster is an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach to scale AI-driven scientific workflows, addressing challenges in observability, reproducibility, and governance of agentic science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift toward AI-driven scientific workflows (agentic science) is necessary due to AI accelerating scientific output and stressing traditional peer-review systems, but scaling remains difficult due to poor observability, non-agent-ready tools, limited traceability, and bespoke systems.

Method: Bohrium acts as a managed hub for AI4S assets (like HuggingFace for AI for Science), making scientific data, software, compute, and lab systems agent-ready. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon workflows. A scientific intelligence substrate organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks.

Result: Demonstrated with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

Conclusion: Scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, which Bohrium+SciMaster provides by enabling composition, auditability, and systematic improvement of AI-driven scientific workflows through reusable building blocks and traceable execution.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

While GatorTron achieved best recall (80.5%), overall performance was comparable between large and small models, suggesting LLMs aren't inherently superior for clinical prediction tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite LLMs transforming NLP tasks, their application in predictive clinical tasks remains under-researched. The study aims to compare LLMs against traditional smaller models for predicting shock in critically ill patients, as timely prediction could enable early interventions and improve patient outcomes.

Method: Used text data from 17,294 ICU stays in MIMIC-III database, selecting patients with length of stay >24 hours and shock index >0.7 (87 abnormal vs 355 normal cases). Compared LLMs (GatorTron-Base, Llama 8B, Mistral 7B) against smaller models (BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec). Used both focal and cross-entropy losses during fine-tuning to address class imbalance.

Result: GatorTron-Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, but overall performance metrics were comparable between small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs). This suggests LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs for predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs don't show clear superiority over smaller models for clinical prediction tasks. Future LLM development should focus on predicting clinical trajectories rather than simpler tasks like named entity recognition or phenotyping to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Result: AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Conclusion: The study successfully addresses the gap in teacher sentiment analysis by creating a comprehensive multimodal dataset and an effective model that accounts for the performative nature of teaching and instructional context.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: LLM-based reasoning agent (SAGE) improves stereotactic radiosurgery planning by providing transparent, auditable reasoning traces while achieving comparable or better dosimetry than human planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption in stereotactic radiosurgery due to opacity concerns, creating a need for transparent, explainable automated planning systems that clinicians can trust.

Method: Developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent tested on 41 brain metastasis patients treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. Compared two variants: non-reasoning model vs. reasoning model using chain-of-thought reasoning.

Result: Reasoning model achieved comparable plan dosimetry to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index) while significantly reducing cochlear dose below human baselines. The reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including constraint verification and trade-off deliberation, with optimization traces serving as auditable logs.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought reasoning enables transparent, auditable automated SRS planning with comparable or superior clinical outcomes to human planners, offering a path toward trustworthy clinical AI adoption through explainable decision-making processes.

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework for long-video QA where a master LLM coordinates grounding and vision agents to localize relevant segments and extract visual details, trained with RL for efficient cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-video QA compress content into lossy summaries or use limited toolsets, which weakens temporal grounding and misses fine-grained visual cues needed for accurate episode-level reasoning.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent framework with: 1) master LLM that coordinates agents and plans with step limits, 2) grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments, 3) vision agent to extract targeted textual observations from visual content. The system is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation.

Result: The multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines on LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ datasets (episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+). Reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning capabilities of the trained agent.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent framework effectively addresses limitations of existing long-video QA methods by enabling precise temporal grounding, complementing subtitles with visual details, and producing interpretable reasoning trajectories through coordinated agent cooperation trained with reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

*Dong Xiao,Renjie Chen,Bailin Deng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Anisotropic Green coordinates for cage-based and variational deformations derived from anisotropic Laplacian equation, enabling versatile shape manipulation with as-rigid-as-possible deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The world is filled with anisotropic characteristics in both natural and engineered systems, but existing deformation methods may not adequately capture anisotropic behavior. There's a need for deformation techniques that can incorporate anisotropy for more versatile and realistic shape manipulation.

Method: Derived anisotropic Green coordinates from the anisotropic Laplacian equation ∇·(A∇u)=0, where A is a symmetric positive definite matrix. Established boundary integral formulation, discretized to get coordinates defined on vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. Used local-global optimization framework for variational shape deformation.

Result: Developed anisotropic Green coordinates with closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. The deformation satisfies linear reproduction and translation invariance properties. Provides versatile deformation options with intuitive geometric interpretations, enabling as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation.

Conclusion: Anisotropic Green coordinates offer artists enhanced flexibility for shape manipulation and introduce a novel perspective on spatial deformation by incorporating anisotropic behavior, providing diverse deformation options beyond traditional isotropic methods.

Abstract: We live in a world filled with anisotropy, a ubiquitous characteristic of both natural and engineered systems. In this study, we concentrate on space deformation and introduce anisotropic Green coordinates, which provide versatile effects for cage-based and variational deformations in both two and three dimensions. The anisotropic Green coordinates are derived from the anisotropic Laplacian equation $\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{A}\nabla u)=0$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. This equation belongs to the class of constant-coefficient second-order elliptic equations, exhibiting properties analogous to the Laplacian equation but incorporating the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ to characterize anisotropic behavior. Based on this equation, we establish the boundary integral formulation, which is subsequently discretized to derive anisotropic Green coordinates defined on the vertices and normals of oriented simplicial cages. The deformation satisfies basic properties such as linear reproduction and translation invariance, and has closed-form expressions for both 2D and 3D scenarios. We also offer intuitive geometric interpretations of this method. Furthermore, our approach computes the gradient and Hessian of the deformation coordinates and employs the local-global optimization framework to facilitate variational shape deformation, enabling flexible shape manipulation while achieving as-rigid-as-possible shape deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that anisotropic Green coordinates offer versatile and diverse deformation options, providing artists with enhanced flexibility and introducing a novel perspective on spatial deformation.

### [122] [LLM-Based Authoring of Agent-Based Narratives through Scene Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20550)
*Vinayak Regmi,Christos Mousas*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A system that uses LLMs to procedurally generate agent-based narratives from drag-and-drop scenes, with evaluation of four lightweight models for efficiency and suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable rapid prototyping of agent narratives by creating an easy-to-use system that can translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent behaviors using LLMs.

Method: Drag-and-drop interface for placing agents/objects with semantic metadata, scene serialization into natural language prompts sent to LLMs, custom parser to interpret structured responses and trigger coordinated behaviors/animations.

Result: Evaluation of four lightweight LLMs shows they can reliably translate scene descriptions into executable agent behaviors, with comparative analysis of consistency and efficiency across complexity scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for procedural agent-based narrative generation, enabling rapid prototyping of virtual agent activities with reliable translation from high-level descriptions to executable behaviors.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for procedurally generating agent-based narratives using large language models (LLMs). Users could drag and drop multiple agents and objects into a scene, with each entity automatically assigned semantic metadata describing its identity, role, and potential interactions. The scene structure is then serialized into a natural language prompt and sent to an LLM, which returns a structured string describing a sequence of actions and interactions among agents and objects. The returned string encodes who performed which actions, when, and how. A custom parser interprets this string and triggers coordinated agent behaviors, animations, and interaction modules. The system supports agent-based scenes, dynamic object manipulation, and diverse interaction types. Designed for ease of use and rapid iteration, the system enables the generation of virtual agent activity suitable for prototyping agent narratives. The performance of the developed system was evaluated using four popular lightweight LLMs. Each model's process and response time were measured under multiple complexity scenarios. The collected data were analyzed to compare consistency across the examined scenarios and to highlight the relative efficiency and suitability of each model for procedural agent-based narratives generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs can reliably translate high-level scene descriptions into executable agent-based behaviors.
