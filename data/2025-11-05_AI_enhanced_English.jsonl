For a 2D\nimage of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for\neach pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In\norder to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,\nestimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse\nin-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,\nencouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ\nmulti-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well\nas imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,\nwhich results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The\nrepresentation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head\ntracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method\nis robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.\nAdditionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained\nrepresentations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and\nmonocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model\ncheckpoint will be made available to the public.", "AI": {"tldr": "DenseMarks is a learned representation for human heads that enables high-quality dense correspondences by predicting 3D embeddings for each pixel in a canonical unit cube, trained using contrastive learning with point matches from talking heads videos.", "motivation": "To create robust dense correspondences for human head images that are interpretable, queryable, and work across diverse poses and individuals while covering the entire head including hair.", "method": "Uses Vision Transformer to predict 3D pixel embeddings in canonical space, trained with contrastive loss on pairwise point matches from talking heads videos, plus multi-task learning with face landmarks, segmentation constraints, and spatial continuity through latent cube features.", "result": "Achieves state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, robust to pose variations and covering entire head including hair.", "conclusion": "DenseMarks provides an effective learned representation for human heads that enables various applications like semantic part finding, tracking, and stereo reconstruction while maintaining consistency across poses and individuals."}}
