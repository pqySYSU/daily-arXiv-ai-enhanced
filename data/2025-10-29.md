### [1] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method for 3D scene generation that repurposes text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile generators, enabling scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes through multi-tile denoising and seamless blending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene generation methods are limited to single objects, require domain-specific training, or lack full 360-degree viewability, creating a need for more flexible and scalable approaches.

Method: Reformulates scene generation as multi-tile denoising problem using overlapping 3D regions independently generated and seamlessly blended via weighted averaging, leveraging existing text-to-3D object diffusion models without retraining.

Result: Enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent scenes with local semantic control, diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing capabilities.

Conclusion: Establishes a simple yet powerful foundation for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction that eliminates need for scene-level datasets and inherits generalization capabilities of object-level priors.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainable AI system for detecting image authenticity using a lightweight CNN classifier and Vision-Language Model that achieves 96.5% accuracy on manipulated 32x32 images with fast inference times suitable for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of verifying visual authenticity in increasingly realistic AI-generated imagery by creating an interpretable detection system.

Method: Combines Faster-Than-Lies CNN classifier with Qwen2-VL-7B Vision-Language Model, uses autoencoder-based reconstruction error maps for artifact localization heatmaps, and categorizes 70 visual artifacts into 8 semantic groups.

Result: Achieves 96.5% accuracy on extended CiFAKE dataset with adversarial perturbations, maintains 175ms inference time on 8-core CPUs, and generates explainable text for detected anomalies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery, with potential applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [3] [Fast and accurate neural reflectance transformation imaging through knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24486)
*Tinsae G. Dulecha,Leonardo Righetto,Ruggero Pintus,Enrico Gobbetti,Andrea Giachetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DisK-NeuralRTI, a knowledge distillation approach to reduce the computational cost of NeuralRTI while maintaining high-quality reflectance transformation imaging results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RTI methods like PTM and HSH are compact but struggle with complex reflectance fields, while NeuralRTI provides superior quality but is computationally expensive for interactive relighting on limited hardware.

Method: The authors propose a novel Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI) approach to reduce computational costs by training smaller networks that learn from the original NeuralRTI model.

Result: The method successfully reduces computational cost while maintaining the high-quality results of NeuralRTI, overcoming previous failures in directly training smaller networks.

Conclusion: DisK-NeuralRTI provides an effective solution for making high-quality neural reflectance transformation imaging practical on limited hardware through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

### [4] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer is a transformer-based framework that uses DINOv2 foundation model for class-agnostic object counting by recognizing visual repetition and structural relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can count objects by perceiving visual repetition and structural relationships, but existing counting models struggle with complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping components. The goal is to develop a counting system that mimics human-like structural perception.

Method: Built on CounTR architecture, replaces visual encoder with self-supervised DINOv2 foundation model for richer feature representations, incorporates positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric relationships, and uses lightweight convolutional decoder to generate density maps.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods on FSC-147 dataset, with superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes.

Conclusion: Integrating foundation models like DINOv2 enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception, advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [5] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework using fixed cameras and deep learning for monitoring floating debris in rivers, focusing on model selection and geometric size estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating anthropogenic debris in rivers negatively impacts biodiversity, water quality, and human activities like navigation and recreation, creating an urgent need for effective monitoring solutions.

Method: The study uses fixed in-situ cameras with deep learning models for continuous debris quantification and monitoring. It tests various models under complex environmental conditions and implements a geometric model using camera characteristics to estimate actual object sizes from 2D images.

Result: The research highlights the importance of dataset constitution protocols, particularly incorporating negative images and addressing temporal leakage. It successfully demonstrates metric object estimation using projective geometry with regression corrections.

Conclusion: The approach enables development of robust, low-cost automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic environments, proving the feasibility of using camera-based deep learning for floating debris monitoring.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [6] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow is a physics-aware super-resolution framework for remote sensing imagery that addresses out-of-distribution robustness through dual-conditioning architecture, multifaceted loss functions, and predictive uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Super-resolution for remote sensing imagery often fails under out-of-distribution conditions, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate results, especially for rare geomorphic features captured by diverse sensors.

Method: Uses dual-conditioning architecture with Gated ControlNet for geometric fidelity and textual prompts for semantic guidance. Introduces multifaceted loss function for spectral/radiometric consistency and employs stochastic forward pass for uncertainty quantification.

Result: In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated outputs approaching ground truth fidelity, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Achieved nearly 40% reduction in FID and qualitative superiority corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics.

Conclusion: RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for controlled generation under severe domain shift.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [7] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP is a training-free framework that improves CLIP for semantic segmentation by exploiting visual discriminability across layers, attention heads, and tokens through three techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models struggle with semantic segmentation due to misalignment between image-level pre-training objectives and pixel-level visual understanding requirements. Prior methods inherit global alignment bias from preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance.

Method: The framework systematically analyzes CLIP's visual discriminability across layers, heads, and tokens, then applies three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to restore visual discriminability without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, showing effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP effectively bridges the gap between CLIP's image-level pre-training and pixel-level segmentation requirements through systematic exploitation of visual discriminability across multiple levels, achieving superior performance without training or additional networks.

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [8] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride is a pipeline that generates coherent scene-level captions for instructional videos without manual scene segmentation, using adaptive frame sampling, multimodal windowing, and dynamic stride selection to improve temporal coherence and educational value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos enhances learning by aligning visual cues with textual guidance, supporting procedural learning and multimodal reasoning. Current captions often lack coherence and quality, undermining educational intent.

Method: Uses YouCookII dataset's scene annotations with adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions. Employs multimodal chain-of-thought process to generate action-object pairs, refined using dynamic stride window selection algorithm that balances temporal context and redundancy.

Result: Empirical evaluations show consistent gains on N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore) against strong baselines including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o. Qualitative analyses confirm more temporally coherent and informative captions.

Conclusion: DynaStride demonstrates promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation by producing more coherent and informative scene-level captions through adaptive temporal reasoning and multimodal integration.

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [9] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D is a low-latency method for novel-view synthesis of human portraits that combines image-to-avatar generation with diffusion models to enhance 3D quality while preserving identity and maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-3D portrait models produce visual artifacts, lack detail, and fail to preserve subject identity, while diffusion models generate high-quality images but lack 3D consistency and are computationally expensive.

Method: Uses a feedforward image-to-avatar pipeline to generate initial 3D representation and noisy renders, then refines them with a single-step diffusion model conditioned on input images and trained for multi-view consistency. Includes pre-training on synthetic multi-view data and fine-tuning on real images.

Result: Qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for portrait novel-view synthesis while maintaining time efficiency.

Conclusion: Image-space diffusion models can effectively enhance existing image-to-avatar methods, achieving high-quality 3D-aware portrait synthesis with low latency and improved identity preservation.

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [10] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for indoor scenes by incorporating planar and geometric priors to overcome limitations in low-texture areas, achieving superior 3D surface reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with ambiguous geometry in large, low-texture indoor scenes due to reliance on photometric loss alone.

Method: Introduces Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) using vision-language segmentation and geometric priors, plus planar and geometric supervision terms during Gaussian optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments show PlanarGS reconstructs more accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods on indoor benchmarks.

Conclusion: PlanarGS effectively addresses 3DGS limitations in indoor environments through planar and geometric priors, enabling high-fidelity surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [11] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe is an adaptive training scheme for implicit neural representations that uses neuron pruning to reduce redundancy and input frequency densification to improve representation capacity, achieving better trade-offs between model size and reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for implicit neural representations face challenges in selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures while managing parameter redundancy, often requiring heuristic approaches and extensive hyperparameter optimization.

Method: AIRe uses a two-stage approach: (1) neuron pruning that identifies less-contributory neurons and applies targeted weight decay before structured pruning, and (2) input frequency densification that adds frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits.

Result: Experiments on images and SDFs show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving or even improving reconstruction quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AIRe provides an effective adaptive training scheme that automatically refines INR architectures during optimization, achieving better efficiency and performance without extensive manual hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [12] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural USD introduces a structured, hierarchical framework for precise object editing in generative models, addressing the challenge of unintended global changes when modifying specific scene elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current controllable generative models struggle with precise and iterative object editing, often causing unintended global changes when attempting to modify specific elements like object colors or backgrounds.

Method: The approach adapts the Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) standard to create Neural USD, representing scenes hierarchically with disentangled control over appearance, geometry, and pose using fine-tuning techniques.

Result: The framework enables iterative and incremental editing workflows while maintaining control over individual objects without affecting other scene elements.

Conclusion: Neural USD successfully addresses the challenge of precise object editing in generative modeling through structured scene representation and disentangled control signals.

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision is a novel image guardrail system that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency in detecting unsafe content, outperforming existing models like GPT-4o while being significantly faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image guardrail models are constrained by predefined categories and lack semantic reasoning, leading to misclassifications and inability to adapt to emerging threats without costly retraining.

Method: SafeVision incorporates a data collection and generation framework, policy-following training pipeline, customized loss function, and diverse QA generation strategy to enhance learning effectiveness and dynamic policy alignment.

Result: SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and 15.5% on VisionHarm-C benchmarks while being over 16x faster.

Conclusion: SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats, eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

*Andriy Myronenko,Dong Yang,Baris Turkbey,Mariam Aboian,Sena Azamat,Esra Akcicek,Hongxu Yin,Pavlo Molchanov,Marc Edgar,Yufan He,Pengfei Guo,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that brings chain-of-thought reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation, making AI predictions transparent by aligning intermediate reasoning steps with observable image evidence and radiology workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language models for medical image analysis are opaque and don't provide the transparent, stepwise reasoning that clinicians rely on for decision-making and auditability.

Method: Couples high-fidelity visual encoding with two-stage training: reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards over X-ray abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists' systematic thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis.

Result: Achieves competitive multi-label classification in out-of-distribution evaluation while improving interpretability. In reader studies with expert radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports.

Conclusion: The approach enables quality assurance, error analysis, and safer human-AI collaboration by providing explicit reasoning traces that reveal why conclusions were reached, which alternatives were considered, and where uncertainty remains.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

*Kazutoshi Akita,Norimichi Ukita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a joint prediction method for multiple Fourier components in arbitrary-scale super-resolution to improve quality and efficiency over existing recurrent neural network approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using recurrent neural networks, which leads to performance degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction.

Method: The paper proposes predicting multiple Fourier components jointly instead of individually.

Result: The proposed joint prediction approach improves both quality and efficiency in arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

Conclusion: Joint prediction of multiple Fourier components is more effective than independent prediction for cost-and-quality controllable super-resolution.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate egocentric AI capabilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or only support short-term tasks, failing to capture the real-world requirements of continuous multi-modal processing and long-term memory retention.

Method: Created a dataset with over 14 hours per participant of synchronized egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains (work & study, lifestyle & routines, social activities, outings & culture), aligned on a unified timeline with human-refined visual narrations and speech transcripts. Defined 12 diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities.

Result: The benchmark contains 3,291 human-verified QA items in multiple formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, open-ended) and introduces two key metrics: Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time to assess correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention.

Conclusion: TeleEgo provides a realistic and comprehensive evaluation framework that advances the development of practical AI assistants capable of processing multi-modal inputs in real time while maintaining evolving long-term memory in daily contexts.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of existing deep learning models in maintaining robustness against distributional variations caused by different acquisition devices, demographic disparities, and imaging conditions in diabetic retinopathy detection.

Method: Integrates adversarial blurred images into the dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to enhance domain generalization capabilities.

Result: Achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on unseen external datasets, with comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The AdvBlur method effectively mitigates the impact of unseen distributional variations in diabetic retinopathy classification, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

TL;DR: Mars-Bench is the first standardized benchmark for evaluating machine learning models on Mars-related tasks using orbital and surface imagery, addressing the lack of evaluation frameworks in Mars science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models have shown strong generalization in various domains, but Mars science lacks standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks, limiting progress in developing domain-specific foundation models.

Method: Created Mars-Bench with 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks focused on key geologic features. Provided standardized datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and vision-language models.

Result: Results suggest Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, indicating potential benefits from domain-adapted pre-training.

Conclusion: Mars-Bench establishes a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science, with all data, models, and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.

TL;DR: APT is a black-box framework that uses LLMs to generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for text-to-image models, bypassing safety filters through dual-evasion strategies and achieving superior transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current red-teaming methods for T2I models require white-box access, use inefficient optimization, and create meaningless prompts that are easily blocked by filters. There's a need for more effective black-box vulnerability assessment.

Method: Uses alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and LLM fine-tuning. Implements dual-evasion strategy: perplexity-based filtering for human-readable prompts and banned-token penalties to avoid blacklist detection.

Result: Achieves excellent red-teaming performance with human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts. Shows superior zero-shot transferability, enabling instant adaptation to unseen prompts and exposing vulnerabilities in commercial APIs like Leonardo.Ai.

Conclusion: APT provides an effective black-box framework for generating human-readable adversarial prompts that bypass safety mechanisms in T2I models, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both performance and transferability.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the vanishing gradient problem that makes training very deep convolutional neural networks challenging.

Method: Uses residual blocks with skip connections that bypass intermediate layers, allowing gradients to flow directly through shortcut paths.

Result: On CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieved 89.9% accuracy compared to 84.1% for traditional deep CNN of similar depth, with faster convergence and more stable training.

Conclusion: Residual Networks successfully enable training of very deep networks by addressing gradient vanishing through skip connections, achieving superior performance over traditional deep CNNs.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

### [22] [Kernelized Sparse Fine-Tuning with Bi-level Parameter Competition for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24037)
*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Shuhui Wang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNELLA is a one-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that overcomes limitations of two-stage sparse tuning approaches by using nonlinear low-rank decomposition for memory efficiency and adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation for better weight selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse tuning methods have two main limitations: they use gradient information for weight selection which overlooks parameter adjustments during fine-tuning, and they require storing all weight matrices in the optimizer leading to high memory usage.

Method: SNELLA uses a one-stage approach with selective weight updates via sparse matrices merged from two low-rank learnable matrices with nonlinear kernel functions. It employs adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation that allows weights to compete across and within layers based on importance scores in an end-to-end manner.

Result: SNELLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1.8% higher Top-1 accuracy (91.9% vs 90.1%) on FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA, and reduces memory usage by 31.1%-39.9% across models ranging from 86M to 632M parameters.

Conclusion: SNELLA provides an effective one-stage solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that outperforms existing methods in both performance and memory efficiency across various vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA is a training-free framework that uses optimal transport to address adversarial misalignment in CLIP models by restoring global image-text alignment and local structural consistency, achieving significant improvements in zero-shot classification under adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations due to misalignment between text and image features, which gets amplified under attacks, leading to performance degradation. Existing methods overlook these feature gaps.

Method: COLA uses optimal transport to align adversarial image embeddings with text features: (1) projects image embeddings onto class text feature subspace to filter distortions, (2) models images/texts as distributions over augmented views and refines alignment via OT with integrated subspace projection.

Result: Extensive evaluations on 14 benchmarks show COLA achieves average 6.7% improvement on ImageNet and variants under PGD attacks while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

Conclusion: COLA effectively addresses adversarial misalignment in CLIP models through optimal transport-based cross-modality alignment, providing robust zero-shot classification without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

*William Yang,Xindi Wu,Zhiwei Deng,Esin Tureci,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOB is a fine-tuning strategy for text-to-image models that extracts class-agnostic attributes (background, pose) from real examples, conditions on them during fine-tuning, and marginalizes them out during generation to mitigate overfitting and improve synthetic data quality for fine-grained classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning T2I models with few real examples can improve synthetic data quality but risks overfitting and reduced diversity, which is problematic for fine-grained classification tasks.

Method: Extract class-agnostic attributes from real examples, explicitly condition T2I model fine-tuning on these attributes, then marginalize them out during synthetic data generation to preserve model priors and reduce unintended inter-class associations.

Result: BOB achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming DataDream by 7.4% on Aircraft dataset, and in 3 of 4 benchmarks, 5 real images + BOB synthetic data outperforms 10 real images alone. It beats prior art in 18 of 24 settings with 2+% improvements in 14 settings.

Conclusion: BOB effectively mitigates overfitting in T2I fine-tuning for synthetic data generation, enabling better fine-grained classification performance with limited real data through attribute conditioning and marginalization.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniText is a training-free generalist framework for Text Image Manipulation (TIM) that addresses limitations of existing text inpainting methods by enabling text removal, style control, and preventing duplicated letters through cross- and self-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based text inpainting methods have three key limitations: inability to remove text, lack of control over text style, and tendency to generate duplicated letters, which hinders their applicability to broader TIM tasks.

Method: Uses self-attention inversion for text removal to reduce text hallucinations, redistributes cross-attention to reduce text hallucination, and introduces novel loss functions (cross-attention content loss and self-attention style loss) in a latent optimization framework for controllable inpainting.

Result: OmniText achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple TIM tasks and metrics, comparable with specialist methods, and introduces OmniText-Bench benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks.

Conclusion: OmniText is the first generalist method capable of performing diverse TIM tasks including text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion/editing with various styles, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

*Shufan Shen,Zhaobo Qi,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Qi Tian,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether pre-trained visual models can simultaneously achieve high interpretability and classifiability. The authors propose an Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to quantify representation interpretability and discover a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread applications of pre-trained visual models require both classifiability and interpretability, but it's unclear whether these two objectives can be achieved simultaneously in pre-trained representations.

Method: The authors propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates information loss and measures the ratio of interpretable semantics within representations. IIS quantifies representation interpretability by leveraging correlation with interpretable semantics.

Result: The study reveals a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability - representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics that can be captured in interpretations. This enables two applications: improving classifiability through interpretability maximization fine-tuning, and obtaining predictions based on interpretations with less accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: Practitioners can unify improvements in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models, as these objectives are positively correlated rather than conflicting.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

TL;DR: UHKD is a knowledge distillation framework that uses frequency-domain transformations to enable effective knowledge transfer between heterogeneous teacher-student models, overcoming architectural discrepancies that hinder traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation methods perform poorly with heterogeneous models due to architectural differences causing semantic discrepancies in intermediate representations. Most existing approaches focus only on logits space and don't effectively utilize intermediate features across different architectures.

Method: Proposes Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD) using Fourier transform to capture global feature information in frequency domain. Includes Feature Transformation Module for compact teacher representations and Feature Alignment Module for projecting and aligning student features via multi-level matching. Uses joint objective combining MSE on intermediate features and KL divergence on logits.

Result: Achieves gains of 5.59% on CIFAR-100 and 0.83% on ImageNet-1K over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effective cross-architecture knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: UHKD effectively unifies heterogeneous representations and enables efficient utilization of visual knowledge across different model architectures through frequency-domain feature alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ETC is a training-free framework that accelerates diffusion models by leveraging consistent denoising trends and model-specific error tolerance, achieving 2.65x speedup over FLUX with minimal quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling, and existing training-free acceleration methods ignore denoising trends and lack error control, leading to trajectory deviations and inconsistent results.

Method: ETC uses (1) a consistent trend predictor that projects historical denoising patterns into stable future directions across multiple approximation steps, and (2) a model-specific error tolerance search mechanism that identifies transition points to derive corrective thresholds.

Result: ETC achieves 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with only -0.074 SSIM score degradation in consistency, demonstrating effective speedup while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: The proposed ETC framework successfully addresses trajectory deviation and inconsistency issues in diffusion model acceleration through trend consistency and error-aware mechanisms, enabling significant speedup with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

TL;DR: A training-free framework that improves text-to-image compositionality by using LLMs to generate explicit layouts and object-centric VLM reranking to select prompt-aligned images iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models struggle with compositionality, often failing to accurately render object counts, attributes, and spatial relations.

Method: Leverage LLMs to synthesize explicit layouts from prompts, inject layouts into image generation, and use object-centric VLM to iteratively rerank candidates for prompt alignment.

Result: Achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models while preserving aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves layout faithfulness in text-to-image generation through explicit layout-grounding and self-refinement techniques.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and conventional diagnostic methods like colonoscopy are subjective, time-consuming, and variable. Deep learning can enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing model for colorectal cancer tissue classification, validated by Grad-CAM visualizations highlighting medically relevant tissue areas.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM

Motivation: To enhance VLM performance on safety-critical autonomous driving tasks by addressing the challenge of diverse question types across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption detection domains.

Method: Four-component framework: 1) Mixture-of-Prompts router for question classification, 2) Task-specific prompts with coordinate systems, spatial reasoning, role-playing, and reasoning chains, 3) Visual assembly module for multi-view image composition, 4) Task-specific inference parameter optimization.

Result: Achieved 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data) using Qwen2.5-VL-72B model, demonstrating significant performance improvement through structured prompting.

Conclusion: Structured prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on autonomous driving tasks, with the proposed framework effectively handling diverse question types and corrupted data scenarios.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAP-SAM2 is a universal adversarial attack method designed to target SAM2, a video segmentation foundation model, by addressing architectural differences from SAM through cross-prompt transferability and dual semantic deviation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the robustness of SAM2 against adversarial attacks, as existing attacks on SAM may not transfer effectively due to architectural differences like directional guidance from prompts and semantic entanglement across frames.

Method: The method involves a target-scanning strategy that divides frames into regions with random prompts to reduce prompt dependency, and a dual semantic deviation framework that distorts semantics within frames and disrupts consistency across consecutive frames.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks show that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks by a large margin.

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2 effectively addresses the challenges in attacking SAM2, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting the vulnerability of SAM2 to adversarial examples.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-SJD is a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework that accelerates autoregressive visual generation by improving token stability across iterations through coupling-based sampling, achieving up to 4.2x faster image generation and 13.3x faster video generation without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive modeling for visual generation suffers from slow inference speed due to per-token generation requiring thousands of steps per sample, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Extends Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD) with MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach using coupling to maximize probability of sampling identical draft tokens across iterations while preserving lossless property. Requires only single-line modification to existing algorithm.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains: up to ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, with no degradation in output quality.

Conclusion: MC-SJD provides a simple yet effective solution to accelerate autoregressive visual generation by addressing token instability in SJD, enabling significant speed improvements while maintaining lossless decoding.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID²Face is a training-centric face anonymization framework that uses a conditional diffusion model with identity-masked learning to disentangle identity and non-identity features, enabling direct anonymization without inference-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based anonymization methods rely on inference-time interventions that cause distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual quality and data utility.

Method: Uses an Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer with Identity Variational Autoencoder for identity features, extracts non-identity attributes from same-identity pairs with bidirectional alignment, and employs an Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer with soft-gating. Includes Orthogonal Identity Mapping to suppress identity leakage.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.

Conclusion: ID²Face provides effective face anonymization through explicit disentanglement of identity and non-identity features in a structured latent space, eliminating the need for inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a novel visual token pruning method for MLLMs that jointly considers saliency and coverage to preserve semantic completeness while reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual token pruning methods focus only on saliency, leading to semantic incompleteness due to redundant token processing in MLLMs.

Method: Proposes SCOPE score that integrates saliency and coverage metrics, using set-coverage computation and token-coverage gain to iteratively select tokens with highest combined score.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language benchmarks using LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next show consistent outperformance over prior approaches.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively reduces computational overhead while better preserving semantic completeness through joint modeling of saliency and coverage in visual token pruning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This paper introduces the first event-based microsaccade dataset using simulated eye movements and evaluates it with spiking neural networks, achieving ~90% accuracy in classifying microsaccades by angular displacement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microsaccade studies using eye trackers or frame-based analysis are costly and limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a high-speed, low-latency alternative for capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal changes efficiently.

Method: Used Blender to render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees across seven classes. Converted these to event streams using v2e, then evaluated with Spiking-VGG11, Spiking-VGG13, Spiking-VGG16, and proposed Spiking-VGG16Flow (optical-flow-enhanced variant) implemented in SpikingJelly.

Result: The models achieved around 90% average accuracy in classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. This demonstrates the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion recognition.

Conclusion: The work establishes a benchmark for event-based vision research and demonstrates the effectiveness of spiking neural networks for microsaccade classification. The dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) to address the functional mismatch between image restoration and detection networks, improving detection robustness in adverse conditions like haze and low light.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional cascade frameworks that use image restoration as pre-processing for object detection suffer from functional mismatch - restoration networks perform smooth transformations while detectors have discontinuous decision boundaries, causing instability and sensitivity to minor perturbations.

Method: Proposed Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) framework that integrates image restoration directly into detector's feature learning, harmonizing Lipschitz continuity of both tasks during training. Implemented as LR-YOLO, extending existing YOLO detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks show LR-YOLO consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy compared to traditional cascade approaches.

Conclusion: LROD framework effectively addresses the functional mismatch between restoration and detection networks by harmonizing their Lipschitz continuity, leading to more robust object detection in adverse conditions.

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

*Zhaotong Yang,Yi Chen,Yanying Li,Shengfeng He,Yangyang Xu,Junyu Dong,Jian Yang,Yong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DeshadowMamba, a shadow removal method using Mamba's selective state space model with CrossGate for shadow-aware context integration and ColorShift regularization for color consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based shadow removal models mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions, causing distorted structures and inconsistent colors due to fixed attention patterns.

Method: Use Mamba's selective state space model for directional context propagation, add CrossGate for shadow-aware similarity modulation, and apply ColorShift regularization with contrastive learning to suppress color contamination.

Result: DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively adapts sequence modeling to maintain structural integrity and chromatic consistency in shadow removal tasks.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

*Jiyu Guo,Shuo Yang,Yiming Huang,Yancheng Long,Xiaobo Xia,Xiu Su,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UtilGen is a utility-centric data augmentation framework that optimizes synthetic data generation using downstream task feedback, achieving superior performance over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most data augmentation approaches focus on visual quality metrics like fidelity and diversity but neglect task-specific requirements, which vary across different tasks and network architectures.

Method: Introduces a weight allocation network to evaluate task-specific utility of synthetic samples, then uses dual-level optimization: model-level optimization tailors generative models to downstream tasks, and instance-level optimization adjusts generation policies like prompt embeddings and initial noise.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets show UtilGen consistently achieves superior performance with average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating the shift from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic image source attribution is challenging under data scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification capabilities.

Method: Generate a prompt describing the image, resynthesize it with all candidate sources, and attribute to the model producing the closest resynthesis to the original in feature space.

Result: The proposed resynthesis method outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and other baselines when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The new dataset provides a challenging attribution framework and represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot and zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot

TL;DR: ViPER is a self-bootstrapping framework that enhances fine-grained visual perception in VLMs through a coarse-to-fine progressive learning process, achieving significant performance gains while maintaining generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical bottleneck of limited fine-grained visual perception in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to data scarcity and limitations of existing methods like SFT (compromises general capabilities) and RFT (prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception).

Method: A two-stage task structuring visual perception as coarse-to-fine progressive process, with self-bootstrapping framework using self-critiquing and self-prediction. Integrates image-level and instance-level reconstruction with two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to create closed-loop training.

Result: Applied to Qwen2.5-VL family, produces Qwen-Viper series with average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception. Consistently demonstrates superior performance across vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability.

Conclusion: ViPER enables self-improvement in perceptual capabilities and provides evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, representing a breakthrough for developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores prompt learning as an efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing scene classification, addressing domain gaps between vision-language models like CLIP and remote sensing imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing scene classification faces challenges due to scarce labeled data and high annotation costs across diverse geographic and sensor domains. Direct application of vision-language models like CLIP is suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate several prompt learning methods: Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches are benchmarked against zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and linear probe on frozen CLIP features.

Result: Prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios across multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets. Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance in cross-dataset generalization tests.

Conclusion: Prompt learning serves as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in remote sensing scene classification.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Motivation: Current deep learning frameworks like nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance but are difficult to deploy clinically due to heavy dependencies and monolithic design.

Method: Decouples preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing; uses Anima toolbox for preprocessing with BIDS-compliant outputs and ONNX Runtime with Float16 quantization for inference, reducing model size by ~50%. Provides both GUI and CLI interfaces.

Result: On 300 sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference <10^-3).

Conclusion: High-performing research pipelines can be successfully transformed into portable, clinically usable tools without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance

heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion

quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN) is proposed for polarization image fusion, addressing contrast differences in polarized images through dynamic luminance injection, global-local feature fusion, and brightness enhancement, achieving superior performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, with applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology analysis, and surface defect detection. The challenge is to integrate complementary information from different polarized images in complex luminance environments.

Method: Proposes MLSN with: 1) Multi-scale spatial weight matrix via brightness-branch for dynamic luminance injection into feature maps; 2) Global-local feature fusion mechanism using windowed self-attention at bottleneck layer; 3) Brightness-Enhancement module for nonlinear luminance correction; 4) Introduces MSP dataset with 1000 polarized image pairs covering 17 complex lighting scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets show MLSN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective evaluations. MS-SSIM and SD metrics are higher than average values of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed MLSN effectively addresses contrast differences in polarized images through luminance-aware processing and achieves superior fusion performance, with the MSP dataset solving the scarcity of high-quality polarized image datasets.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,

*Herman Bergström,Zhongqi Yue,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies when and how radiology reports can improve medical image classification, finding that report utility depends on task type and training phase - beneficial for diagnostic tasks with text-represented labels but potentially harmful for prognostic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain rich expert annotations but require manual work, raising the question of when they can effectively improve image-only classification, especially for tasks with labels weakly associated with text.

Method: Systematic study of using radiology reports during both pre-training and fine-tuning across diagnostic and prognostic tasks, evaluating under varying training set sizes and comparing explicit image-text alignment approaches.

Result: Reports during pre-training help when labels are well-represented in text but can be detrimental otherwise; fine-tuning with reports provides significant improvements and sometimes larger impact than pre-training method.

Conclusion: Provides actionable insights for leveraging privileged text data in medical image classification while highlighting current research gaps in when and how to effectively use radiology reports.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Training on healthy controls (IXI) outperformed training on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) in both lesion segmentation and sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-stroke MRI reveals secondary structural changes like atrophy and ventricular enlargement that serve as imaging biomarkers but are poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. There's a need for unsupervised approaches to detect both focal and non-lesional abnormalities.

Method: Used REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised abnormality detection. Trained two models: one on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and another on healthy controls (IXI). Evaluated performance using dual-expert central-slice annotations on ATLAS data with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps.

Result: The IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43) compared to the ATLAS-trained model on ATLAS test subjects.

Conclusion: Training on fully healthy anatomy improves modeling of normal variability, enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities in post-stroke patients.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,

TL;DR: A visual multi-object tracking method combining stochastic particle filtering with deterministic association for consistent target identification under nonlinear dynamics and varying target numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address identifier consistency challenges in multi-object tracking with unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics, where traditional methods struggle with maintaining track identities during interactions and occlusions.

Method: Joint stochastic-deterministic approach: stochastic particle filter with PSO optimization for nonlinear dynamics, plus deterministic association using cost matrix with spatial consistency, detection confidences, and track penalties. Includes velocity regression for trend-seed velocities and smooth state updating.

Result: Superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with flexible operation for both pre-recorded videos and live camera streams.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach effectively maintains identifier consistency in challenging tracking scenarios with nonlinear dynamics and varying target numbers, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sensor-free approach using satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor reservoir volume in Lebanon without ground sensors, achieving high accuracy with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sustainable management of Qaraaoun Reservoir requires reliable monitoring despite sensor malfunctions and limited maintenance capacity in Lebanon.

Method: Integrates Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery with a new water segmentation index and Support Vector Regression (SVR) model trained on bathymetry data to estimate volume from surface area alone.

Result: 95% shoreline alignment with ground truth, SVR error under 1.5% of full capacity, R² > 0.98, enabling continuous sensor-independent monitoring.

Conclusion: Method provides robust, cost-effective solution for reservoir monitoring that can be replicated globally, with 50-year time-series data valuable for climate change research.

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and

### [53] [XAI Evaluation Framework for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24414)
*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework for explainable AI (XAI) methods in semantic segmentation, addressing the gap in evaluation strategies for this specific computer vision task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for transparency and trust in AI models, especially in safety-critical domains. While XAI has emerged as a solution, rigorous evaluation methods for semantic segmentation remain underdeveloped compared to classification tasks.

Method: The proposed framework is specifically designed for semantic segmentation evaluation, accounting for both spatial and contextual complexities. It employs pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide fine-grained interpretability insights.

Result: Simulation results using class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: The framework contributes to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable semantic segmentation models by providing a systematic approach to evaluate XAI methods in this domain.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

### [54] [Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24437)
*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCIC-sgp introduces a functional decomposition framework for learned image compression that uses self-generated priors to separate structural backbone from high-entropy details, achieving superior rate-distortion performance and reducing geometric deformation artifacts at low bitrates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression methods struggle to model complex correlation structures in natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures with transient local textures, leading to severe geometric deformation at low bitrates.

Method: The framework first encodes a self-generated prior to capture the image's structural backbone, then uses this prior to holistically modulate the entire compression pipeline, especially the analysis transform, allowing it to focus on residual high-entropy details through hierarchical, dependency-driven information disentanglement.

Result: The method substantially mitigates geometric deformation artifacts at low bitrates and achieves significant BD-rate reductions of 14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against VVC test model VTM-12.1 on Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick datasets.

Conclusion: The deeply-conditioned image compression via self-generated priors effectively disentangles information streams, enabling superior compression performance by separating structural information from high-entropy details.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

*Pablo Acuaviva,Aram Davtyan,Mariam Hassan,Sebastian Stapf,Ahmad Rahimi,Alexandre Alahi,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) pretrained on spatiotemporal data show better data efficiency and compositional understanding than LLMs in visual tasks, suggesting video pretraining provides strong inductive biases for visual foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have succeeded in language tasks with minimal supervision but struggle in the visual domain with compositional understanding and sample efficiency. The paper investigates whether VDMs can bridge this gap through their inherent spatiotemporal inductive biases.

Method: The researchers designed a controlled evaluation where both pretrained LLMs and VDMs were equipped with lightweight adapters and tested on various visual tasks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata.

Result: VDMs demonstrated higher data efficiency than LLMs across all benchmarks, showing better performance in visual tasks despite using the same adapter architecture.

Conclusion: Video pretraining provides strong inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models, offering better compositional understanding and sample efficiency compared to language-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

### [57] [Kineo: Calibration-Free Metric Motion Capture From Sparse RGB Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24464)
*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavoué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo is a calibration-free pipeline for markerless motion capture from unsynchronized, uncalibrated RGB cameras that simultaneously calibrates cameras and reconstructs 3D keypoints at metric scale with significant accuracy improvements over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing markerless motion capture systems that require precise camera calibration, which restricts accessibility for non-experts and in-the-wild captures, while addressing the computational cost and accuracy issues of current calibration-free approaches.

Method: Leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf detectors with confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling and graph-based global optimization to simultaneously calibrate cameras (including distortion coefficients) and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point maps at metric scale, with a pairwise reprojection consensus score for reliability assessment.

Result: Substantial improvements over prior methods: 83-85% reduction in camera translation error, 86-92% reduction in camera angular error, and 83-91% reduction in world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) on EgoHumans and Human3.6M datasets. Efficient processing (36min for 1h20min footage).

Conclusion: Kineo provides an effective, efficient calibration-free solution for markerless motion capture that significantly outperforms existing approaches while being accessible for non-experts and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow converts pretrained flow models into flow map models without architectural changes, enabling high-quality image generation in 1-4 steps with over 100x faster inference while maintaining competitive FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current denoising generative models require many sampling steps due to discretization error, and existing flow map approaches need architectural modifications that limit compatibility with pretrained models.

Method: A decoding strategy that conditions final blocks of diffusion transformers on subsequent timesteps, converting flow models to flow maps without architectural changes, combined with enhanced training techniques.

Result: Achieved 1-step FID of 2.16 on ImageNet 256x256 and 2.12 on 512x512, surpassing prior art. With 4 steps, achieved FID of 1.51 and 1.68, nearly matching flow model performance with over 100x faster inference.

Conclusion: Training flow models first and then converting them to flow maps is more efficient than training flow maps from scratch, enabling fast high-quality generation while maintaining compatibility with existing pretrained models.

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad is a framework that enhances Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with internal visual scratchpads for generative visual thinking, enabling them to interleave textual reasoning with visual latent generation for improved planning and imagination capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs excel at visual understanding but struggle with complex scenarios requiring visual planning and imagination. The research is inspired by how humans use sketching as visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas.

Method: The framework integrates visual generation directly into MLLMs' native autoregressive reasoning process using two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head that produces visual representations autoregressively, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder that renders these into human-interpretable images.

Result: Experiments on the MazePlanning dataset show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or superior reasoning performance to backbone MLLMs and generalizes across different frontier models including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL.

Conclusion: By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, the framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications in complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in real-world computer environments, addressing the gap in fair assessment of tool invocation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations mainly focus on GUI interaction skills while overlooking tool invocation abilities enabled by Model Context Protocol (MCP), creating unfair comparisons between agents with integrated tools and those evaluated only on GUI interaction.

Method: Created OSWorld-MCP benchmark with 158 high-quality tools covering 7 common applications through a novel automated code-generation pipeline combined with curated existing tools, all manually validated for functionality, applicability, and versatility.

Result: MCP tools significantly improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet), but even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates (only 36.3%), indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP provides the first fair standard for evaluating multimodal agents' tool invocation capabilities, revealing both the importance of tool usage and current limitations, while setting a new benchmark for complex, tool-assisted environments.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

*Xu Jiang,Huiying Pan,Ligen Shi,Jianing Sun,Wenfeng Xu,Xing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning method using Gaussian RBF and KAN networks to correct scatter artifacts in CBCT imaging by modeling rotational symmetry of scatter distribution in projection domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT suffers from scatter during data acquisition, causing CT value bias and reduced tissue contrast that degrades diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions to model point scatter function and embeds it into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks layers to learn high-dimensional scatter features, incorporating physical prior knowledge of rotational symmetry.

Result: Validated through synthetic and real-scan experiments, showing effective scatter artifact correction in reconstructed images with superior quantitative metrics compared to current methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully corrects scatter artifacts in CBCT by combining physical scatter distribution characteristics with KAN's complex function mapping capabilities.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch CNN for face forgery detection that combines spatial (RGB) and frequency domain features using channel attention and a unified loss function, achieving strong performance across multiple forgery types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables creation of realistic forged facial images, posing threats to AI security, digital media integrity, and public trust. There's urgent need for robust detection methods to counter malicious uses like misinformation and identity fraud.

Method: Proposes a dual-branch CNN with RGB branch for semantic information and frequency branch for high-frequency artifacts. Uses channel attention module to fuse features and FSC Loss combining focal loss, supervised contrastive loss, and frequency center margin loss.

Result: Evaluated on DiFF benchmark with four forgery types (text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, face edit). Achieves strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human accuracy.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates effectiveness and potential contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks through its dual-domain approach and unified loss function.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

TL;DR: PathoGaze1.0 is a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing pathologists' visual search and decision-making during cancer diagnosis from whole-slide images, including eye-tracking, mouse interactions, and diagnostic decisions from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists' diagnostic accuracy averages around 70% with poor consistency even when adding a second pathologist, and there's a lack of behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies in whole-slide image interpretation.

Method: Collected 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs using an ecologically valid application-grounded testbed called PTAH.

Result: Recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events, creating a comprehensive behavioral dataset that captures the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: The PathoGaze1.0 dataset provides valuable behavioral data that can help explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies, and could be used to improve training for both pathologists and AI systems supporting human experts in cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Group Relative Attention Guidance (GRAG), a method that enables continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity in Diffusion-in-Transformer models by reweighting delta values between tokens and their bias vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models lack effective control over editing degree, limiting their ability to achieve customized results. The authors observed that Query and Key tokens share a layer-dependent bias vector representing inherent editing behavior.

Method: The authors propose GRAG which reweights the delta values between tokens and their corresponding bias vectors to modulate the model's focus on input image relative to editing instructions. This enables control over editing intensity without any tuning and can be integrated with just four lines of code.

Result: Extensive experiments show GRAG consistently enhances editing quality across existing frameworks. Compared to Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over editing degree.

Conclusion: GRAG provides an effective solution for fine-grained control of editing intensity in Diffusion-in-Transformer models, offering better performance than existing guidance methods while maintaining simplicity and ease of implementation.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

### [65] [SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667)
*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE is a zero-shot approach for video transitions that combines structural guidance with generative synthesis to create smooth, semantically consistent transitions between diverse video clips without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video transition methods struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, creating artifacts and breaking temporal coherence. There's a need for content-aware and visually coherent transitions that can handle these challenging scenarios.

Method: SAGE uses a zero-shot approach that combines structural guidance (via line maps and motion flow) with generative synthesis. It draws on artistic workflows by aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity.

Result: Extensive experiments show SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines (FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI) on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips.

Conclusion: SAGE enables smooth, semantically consistent video transitions without fine-tuning, effectively bridging diverse clips with large temporal gaps or semantic differences while maintaining visual coherence.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

TL;DR: MIC-BEV is a Transformer-based BEV perception framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection that handles variable camera setups and demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-based detection models underperform in infrastructure-based perception scenarios due to multi-view setups, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs, and various road layouts.

Method: Proposes a graph-enhanced fusion module that integrates multi-view image features into BEV space using geometric relationships between cameras and BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. Uses Transformer architecture and supports heterogeneous camera parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection on both synthetic M2I dataset and real-world RoScenes dataset. Maintains robustness under extreme weather and sensor degradation conditions.

Conclusion: MIC-BEV demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in intelligent transportation systems, offering reliable infrastructure-based perception with flexibility and robustness.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [67] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers naturally develop object binding capabilities during self-supervised pretraining, with over 90% accuracy in determining whether patches belong to the same object, particularly in models like DINO, MAE, and CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether object binding - the brain's ability to group features into coherent objects - naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers, challenging the assumption that explicit object-centric attention mechanisms are necessary.

Method: Used similarity probes to decode 'IsSameObject' property from patch embeddings across ViT layers, comparing self-supervised (DINO, MAE, CLIP) vs ImageNet-supervised models, and performed ablation studies to test functional importance.

Result: Object binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (90+% accuracy) but is markedly weaker in supervised models. IsSameObject is encoded in low-dimensional subspace and actively guides attention. Ablating it degrades performance.

Conclusion: Object binding naturally emerges in self-supervised ViTs as an acquired ability rather than architectural artifact, serving the pretraining objective and challenging views that ViTs lack object binding capabilities.

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE is a novel Mixture-of-Experts framework for Diffusion Transformers that addresses the limitations of applying MoE to visual tasks by introducing a two-step router with explicit routing guidance to promote expert specialization in handling visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attempts to apply Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown limited gains due to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, which hinders expert specialization in vision MoE applications.

Method: ProMoE features a two-step router with explicit routing guidance: 1) Conditional routing partitions image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets based on functional roles, 2) Prototypical routing refines assignments of conditional tokens using learnable prototypes based on semantic content. It also includes a routing contrastive loss to enhance intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives, showing significant improvements over previous vision MoE approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed ProMoE framework successfully addresses the challenges of applying MoE to visual tasks by providing explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization, with the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space offering a natural mechanism for incorporating semantic guidance that proves crucial for vision MoE applications.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URSA is a discrete video generation framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches through iterative global refinement of spatiotemporal tokens, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art continuous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete approaches for video generation lag behind continuous-space methods due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency, creating a need for improved discrete generative modeling.

Method: URSA formulates video generation as iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens, featuring Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanisms for efficient scaling, plus asynchronous temporal fine-tuning for unified task handling.

Result: URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods on challenging video and image generation benchmarks.

Conclusion: URSA successfully bridges the performance gap between discrete and continuous video generation approaches, enabling scalable high-resolution and long-duration video generation with fewer inference steps.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative View Stitching (GVS) enables collision-free camera-guided video generation by sampling entire sequences in parallel and using diffusion stitching with Omni Guidance for temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models struggle with camera-guided generation using predefined trajectories, leading to scene collisions and generation collapse. The limitation stems from inability to condition on future frames during generation.

Method: Proposes Generative View Stitching (GVS) - a sampling algorithm that extends diffusion stitching from robot planning to video generation. Uses Diffusion Forcing framework and introduces Omni Guidance for conditioning on both past and future frames, plus loop-closing mechanism for long-range coherence.

Result: GVS achieves stable, collision-free camera-guided video generation with frame-to-frame consistency. Successfully handles various predefined camera paths including impossible geometries like Oscar Reutersvärd's Impossible Staircase.

Conclusion: GVS overcomes limitations of autoregressive models by enabling parallel sampling with future conditioning, providing a robust solution for camera-guided video generation that maintains consistency and avoids collisions throughout complex camera trajectories.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

### [71] [Evaluating Long-Term Memory for Long-Context Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23730)
*Alessandra Terranova,Björn Ross,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods for LLMs using LoCoMo benchmark shows memory approaches reduce token usage by 90% while maintaining accuracy. Memory architecture should scale with model capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable true conversational continuity and experiential learning in large language models, effective memory systems are needed, but it's unclear which memory types work best for long-context conversational tasks.

Method: Used LoCoMo benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues with QA tasks requiring diverse reasoning. Evaluated full-context prompting, semantic memory (RAG and agentic), episodic memory (in-context learning), and procedural memory (prompt optimization).

Result: Memory-augmented approaches reduced token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Different memory types work best for different model capabilities: small models benefit from RAG, while strong reasoning models gain from episodic learning and complex agentic semantic memory.

Conclusion: Memory architecture complexity should scale with model capability. Episodic memory helps LLMs recognize their own knowledge limits. Memory-augmented methods significantly improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

*Ramshankar Bhuvaneswaran,Handan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BitSkip is a hybrid framework that explores interactions between extreme quantization and dynamic routing in LLMs. Surprisingly, a simple 8-bit quantized model without Hadamard transform outperforms more complex variants and even competes with full-precision baseline, while Hadamard transforms cause catastrophic performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the compositional effects of complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing in LLMs, as their interactions remain poorly understood despite individual benefits being well-documented.

Method: Introduces BitSkip, a hybrid architectural framework that systematically explores interactions between quantization and routing techniques. Tests various configurations including 8-bit quantization without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1), 4-bit quantization, and Hadamard-enhanced variants.

Result: BitSkip-V1 (8-bit without Hadamard) achieves perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19 for full-precision baseline, outperforming more complex 4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts. Hadamard transforms caused catastrophic 37,000% performance degradation due to training instability. BitSkip-V1 shows superior early-exit characteristics with layer 18 providing 32.5% speed gain for only 4% quality loss.

Conclusion: Simple 8-bit quantization without complex enhancements can outperform more sophisticated approaches and even compete with full-precision models, while Hadamard transforms introduce fundamental training instability. The optimal configuration provides significant speed gains with minimal quality loss through strategic early-exit routing.

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically explor- ing these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8- bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of LLMs' ability to process culturally grounded figurative language in Arabic and English, showing significant performance gaps in understanding cultural nuances and pragmatic usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLMs can understand and pragmatically use culturally nuanced figurative expressions that encode local knowledge, using figurative language as a proxy for cultural reasoning capabilities.

Method: Designed evaluation tasks for contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation using Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Evaluated 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on these culturally grounded expressions.

Result: Consistent performance hierarchy: Arabic proverbs 4.29% lower accuracy than English proverbs, Egyptian idioms 10.28% lower than Arabic proverbs. Pragmatic use accuracy drops 14.07% relative to understanding, though contextual sentences improve accuracy by 10.66%. Maximum 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with perfect inter-annotator agreement.

Conclusion: Figurative language serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning - while LLMs can often interpret figurative meaning, they struggle with appropriate pragmatic usage. Released Kinayat dataset for future research on Egyptian Arabic idioms.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes American Sign Language (ASL) STEM dialogue using motion capture data, showing that interactive signing differs significantly from isolated signs and monologues in duration and articulation, with dialogue signs being 24.6%-44.6% shorter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sign language models are trained on interpreter or isolated vocabulary data, which fails to capture the natural variability and dynamic adaptations that occur in real human dialogue, particularly in educational settings where novel STEM vocabulary is used.

Method: Collected motion capture dataset of ASL STEM dialogue, used continuous kinematic features to analyze dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted articles, and evaluated sign embedding models on STEM sign recognition and entrainment measurement.

Result: Dialogue signs are 24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than isolated signs, with significant reductions not present in monologue contexts. The study successfully disentangled dialogue-specific entrainment from individual effort reduction and showed spatiotemporal changes across repeated STEM term mentions.

Conclusion: The research bridges linguistic analysis and computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation, demonstrating that natural dialogue exhibits distinct kinematic patterns that should be considered in sign language technologies.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

TL;DR: CRADLE BENCH is a new benchmark for detecting mental health crisis situations in language model interactions, covering 7 crisis types with temporal labels and clinician-annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models struggle to reliably detect mental health crises like suicide ideation, domestic violence, and sexual harassment during user interactions, which can have serious consequences if missed.

Method: Created a benchmark with 600 clinician-annotated evaluation examples, 420 development examples, and ~4K training examples automatically labeled using majority-vote ensemble of multiple language models. Fine-tuned six crisis detection models on subsets with different agreement criteria.

Result: The majority-vote ensemble approach for automatic labeling significantly outperforms single-model annotation. The benchmark provides complementary models trained under different agreement criteria (consensus vs unanimous).

Conclusion: CRADLE BENCH addresses the critical gap in mental health crisis detection for language models by providing a comprehensive, clinically-aligned benchmark with temporal awareness and robust training data generation methods.

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

*Yize Cheng,Arshia Soltani Moakhar,Chenrui Fan,Kazem Faghih,Parsa Hosseini,Wenxiao Wang,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM agents lack temporal awareness in multi-turn conversations, causing them to either over-rely or under-rely on previous context when deciding tool calls. The paper introduces TicToc-v1 test set with time-sensitive scenarios and shows current models perform poorly (60-65% alignment with human preferences) even with timestamp augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents suffer from temporal blindness - they operate with stationary context and fail to account for real-world time elapsed between messages, leading to poor tool-calling decisions in dynamic environments.

Method: Created TicToc-v1 test set with 34 time-sensitive scenarios, augmented dialogue messages with explicit timestamps, collected human preferences for tool-calling decisions, and evaluated LLM alignment with human preferences under varying time intervals.

Result: Without time information, models perform slightly better than random (top alignment ~60%). Adding timestamps provides modest improvement (peaking at ~65%), with larger models showing better performance. Prompt-based alignment methods have limited effectiveness.

Conclusion: Specific post-training alignment is needed to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception, as current approaches show limited temporal awareness even with timestamp augmentation.

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn
conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic
environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by
default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the
real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability
when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has
passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often
either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or
under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,
we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across
34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user
question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed
since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue
messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and
evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,
creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous
observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call
(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with
human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show
that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than
random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding
timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the
improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,
prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the
need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with
human temporal perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL systems use LLMs to convert tabular database results into natural language representations, but information loss and errors in presenting tabular results in natural language remain largely unexplored. There is a need for better evaluation methods for these LLM-generated NLRs.

Method: The authors developed Combo-Eval, a novel evaluation method that combines the benefits of multiple existing evaluation approaches. They also created NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset specifically for NLR benchmarking.

Result: Combo-Eval achieves a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61% while optimizing evaluation fidelity. Human evaluations demonstrate that Combo-Eval has superior alignment with human judgments, applicable across scenarios both with and without ground truth references.

Conclusion: Combo-Eval provides an effective and efficient evaluation framework for LLM-generated natural language representations of database query results, addressing the previously unexplored problem of information loss and errors in converting tabular data to natural language.

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Motivation: To address complex reasoning requirements in NL2SQL tasks including arithmetic, commonsense, and hypothetical inference across bilingual scenarios, while overcoming limitations of multi-agent approaches that suffer from orchestration overhead.

Method: Two-agent framework: Planner generates stepwise natural language plans, SQL agent converts plans to SQL. Uses feedback-guided meta-prompting to refine a single planner, entity-linking for multilingual handling, and plan diversification with majority voting.

Result: Ranked first with 55.0% EX in English and 56.7% EX in Chinese, exceeding second-best by over 6%, while maintaining >99% SQL validity.

Conclusion: The feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy effectively improves planner generalization without complexity, entity-linking addresses multilingual challenges, and plan diversification enhances reliability through majority voting.

Abstract: We present OraPlan-SQL, our system for the Archer NL2SQL Evaluation Challenge
2025, a bilingual benchmark requiring complex reasoning such as arithmetic,
commonsense, and hypothetical inference. OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding
the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0%
in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA).
Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that
generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these
plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our
refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple
sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a
feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure
cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills
them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system
prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual
scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate
entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities
and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability
through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each
query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output
selected via majority voting over their executions.

### [80] [AfriMTEB and AfriE5: Benchmarking and Adapting Text Embedding Models for African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23896)
*Kosei Uemura,Miaoran Zhang,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriMTEB is a new multilingual benchmark for African languages with 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six new datasets. AfriE5 model achieves SOTA performance through cross-lingual contrastive distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages are underrepresented in existing multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB, with tasks often repurposed from translation benchmarks. There's a need for comprehensive evaluation covering diverse African languages and new task types.

Method: Created AfriMTEB benchmark with expanded coverage of 59 African languages and introduced new tasks. Developed AfriE5 model by adapting mE5 through cross-lingual contrastive distillation for African languages.

Result: AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines including Gemini-Embeddings and mE5. The new benchmark includes datasets spanning 14-56 African languages with new tasks like hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion classification.

Conclusion: AfriMTEB provides comprehensive evaluation for African languages, addressing previous underrepresentation. AfriE5 demonstrates effective adaptation of existing models to African languages through cross-lingual distillation, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

*Kaveh Eskandari Miandoab,Mahammed Kamruzzaman,Arshia Gharooni,Gene Louis Kim,Vasanth Sarathy,Ninareh Mehrabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show stereotypical biases and are susceptible to input perturbations that increase biased behavior, especially for less-studied demographic communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models demonstrate stereotypical biases due to training data, and current bias alignment methods are brittle, requiring more robust approaches.

Method: A novel three-step plug-and-play augmentation framework applied to fairness evaluation benchmarks like BBQ, testing LLMs' susceptibility to input perturbations.

Result: LLMs (including state-of-the-art models) show higher likelihood of stereotypical behavior when inputs are perturbed, with more biased behavior for less-studied demographic communities.

Conclusion: Fairness and safety research needs expansion to include more diverse communities, as current models are vulnerable to input perturbations that exacerbate biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

### [82] [Agent-based Automated Claim Matching with Instruction-following LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23924)
*Dina Pisarevskaya,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-step LLM-based pipeline for automated claim matching that uses LLMs to generate prompts and then performs binary classification, showing that LLM-generated prompts outperform human-crafted ones and smaller LLMs can match larger ones' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated claim matching approach that leverages instruction-following LLMs more effectively while reducing computational costs, and to gain insights into how LLMs understand claim matching tasks.

Method: A two-step pipeline: first uses LLMs to generate prompts, then performs claim matching as binary classification with LLMs. Explores using different LLMs for each step and compares performance of various model sizes.

Result: LLM-generated prompts outperform state-of-the-art human-generated prompts. Smaller LLMs can achieve similar performance to larger ones in prompt generation, enabling computational savings. Using different LLMs for each pipeline step proves effective.

Conclusion: The proposed agent-based approach with LLMs provides an efficient and effective solution for automated claim matching, offering computational benefits while maintaining high performance, and provides valuable insights into LLM understanding of the task.

Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach for the automated claim matching task
with instruction-following LLMs. We propose a two-step pipeline that first
generates prompts with LLMs, to then perform claim matching as a binary
classification task with LLMs. We demonstrate that LLM-generated prompts can
outperform SOTA with human-generated prompts, and that smaller LLMs can do as
well as larger ones in the generation process, allowing to save computational
resources. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of using different LLMs for
each step of the pipeline, i.e. using an LLM for prompt generation, and another
for claim matching. Our investigation into the prompt generation process in
turn reveals insights into the LLMs' understanding of claim matching.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free cascade system for auto-prompting LLMs to assess e-commerce product quality, automatically generating and refining prompts across thousands of category-attribute pairs without labels or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between general language understanding and domain-specific knowledge in complex industrial catalogs, reducing the need for extensive domain expert effort in prompt engineering.

Method: Uses a cascade approach starting from human-crafted seed prompts, progressively optimizing instructions to meet catalog-specific requirements without training labels or model fine-tuning.

Result: Improves precision and recall by 8-10% over traditional chain-of-thought prompting while reducing domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute (99% reduction). Generalizes effectively across five languages and multiple quality assessment tasks.

Conclusion: The auto-prompt cascade provides an efficient, scalable solution for product quality assessment in e-commerce, significantly reducing expert effort while maintaining performance gains across languages and tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

*Kyomin Hwang,Hyeonjin Kim,Seungyeon Kim,Sunghyun Wee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reveals that multilingual LLMs exhibit language confusion during unlearning when fine-tuned with parallel multilingual data, causing standard reference-based metrics to fail. It introduces N-Mix score to quantify this issue and proposes semantic-based metrics for better evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies showed insufficient multilingual knowledge erasure using only English data, but their analyses were performance-oriented. This paper addresses the blind spot of language confusion that occurs when multilingual LLMs are fully fine-tuned with parallel multilingual data before unlearning.

Method: The study tackles language confusion in three steps: (1) introduces N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively measure language confusion, (2) demonstrates that reference-based metrics produce false negatives when N-Mix is high, and (3) proposes semantic-based metrics to directly assess generated content.

Result: The research shows that language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs during unlearning, and that standard reference-based evaluation metrics fail when this phenomenon occurs.

Conclusion: There is a need for new semantic-based evaluation metrics for unlearning in multilingual LLMs that can directly assess the content of generated sentences, as traditional reference-based metrics are inadequate when language confusion occurs.

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

*Mengzhou Sun,Sendong Zhao,Jianyu Chen,Haochun Wang,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Eval is a new method that uses heterogeneity analysis from Evidence-Based Medicine to detect factual errors in Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems for medical QA by verifying evidence from multiple sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG applications in medical question-answering generate incorrect information (hallucinations) and fail to use external knowledge correctly, leading to unreliable responses.

Method: Extracts additional medical literature from external knowledge bases, retrieves evidence documents from RAG systems, and uses heterogeneity analysis to check if evidence supports different viewpoints in responses while assessing evidence reliability.

Result: Shows improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs in detecting factual errors in RAG responses.

Conclusion: M-Eval helps detect errors in RAG-based medical systems, makes LLM applications more reliable, and reduces diagnostic errors through evidence verification.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the
applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PICOs-RAG improves evidence-based medicine by expanding and normalizing user queries using PICO format, enhancing retrieval efficiency by 8.8% over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle with complex clinical queries that lack information or use imprecise language, leading to irrelevant evidence retrieval and unhelpful answers in evidence-based medicine.

Method: The PICOs-RAG method expands and normalizes user queries into professional formats using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework from EBM to extract key information for improved retrieval.

Result: The approach achieved up to 8.8% improvement in retrieval efficiency and relevance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: PICOs-RAG significantly enhances large language models' performance, making them more helpful and reliable medical assistants in evidence-based medicine applications.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method that uses meta-analysis principles (reliability, heterogeneity, and extrapolation analysis) to re-rank and filter medical evidence for LLMs in evidence-based medicine, improving accuracy by up to 11.4% in RAG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG applications in evidence-based medicine struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence due to EBM's stringent evidence requirements, leading to potential misdiagnoses when using LLMs for clinical applications.

Method: Proposes a meta-analysis-inspired approach combining reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis to re-rank and filter medical evidence from PubMed dataset for LLMs.

Result: Achieves up to 11.4% accuracy improvement in experiments, enabling RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from PubMed.

Conclusion: The method successfully reduces incorrect knowledge infusion into LLM responses and helps users receive more effective replies in evidence-based medicine applications.

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

*Yizhu Jiao,Sha Li,Sizhe Zhou,Heng Ji,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes TEXT2DB, a new IE formulation that integrates IE output with target databases, and introduces OPAL, an LLM agent framework with Observer, Planner, and Analyzer components to handle this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between IE ontology and downstream application needs by enabling direct integration of IE output with target databases based on user instructions.

Method: Proposes OPAL framework with three components: Observer (interacts with database), Planner (generates code-based plans with IE model calls), and Analyzer (provides code quality feedback before execution).

Result: OPAL successfully adapts to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling required IE models, though challenges remain with large databases and extraction hallucination.

Conclusion: The TEXT2DB formulation and OPAL framework effectively bridge IE output with database integration, but complex dependencies and extraction hallucination require further investigation.

Abstract: The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge
from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to
the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We
propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE
output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a
document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the
database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction.
This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and
adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate
this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as
data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an
LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer
component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that
generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component
that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments
show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating
different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight
difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies
and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

### [90] [Teaching LLMs to Abstain via Fine-Grained Semantic Confidence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24020)
*Hao An,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel reinforcement learning framework called FiSCoRe that uses fine-grained semantic confidence to help LLMs better abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope, improving reliability across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs rely on coarse-grained confidence signals, leading to imprecise awareness of knowledge boundaries and unreliable abstention behavior.

Method: Proposes FiSCoRe framework that samples multiple candidate answers, conducts semantic clustering, and trains LLMs to retain answers in high-confidence clusters while discarding those in low-confidence clusters using reinforcement learning.

Result: Significantly enhances reliability in both in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks, with improved abstention performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Fine-grained semantic confidence rewards provide more precise guidance for LLMs to understand their knowledge boundaries, leading to more reliable abstention behavior and reduced hallucinations.

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Yadong Zhang,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD) introduces a token-level gating mechanism that selectively applies distillation loss only to tokens accepted by the teacher, avoiding learning from uncertain predictions and improving student model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KD applies distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, forcing students to learn from teacher's uncertain predictions which introduces noise and harms performance, especially when teachers are much larger.

Method: SpecKD uses a dynamic token-level gating mechanism inspired by speculative decoding - student's token proposals are verified against teacher's distribution, with distillation loss applied only to accepted tokens while rejected tokens are masked out.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models with state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SpecKD provides an effective plug-and-play framework that addresses the limitations of uniform KD application by selectively applying distillation loss based on teacher confidence, resulting in improved student model performance and training stability.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

*Saujas Vaduguru,Yilun Hua,Yoav Artzi,Daniel Fried*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to train large multimodal models to form linguistic conventions through simulated reference games, enabling efficient communication with humans by reducing message length while increasing success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans naturally form ad hoc linguistic conventions over time to communicate more efficiently using shared context, and the research aims to replicate this capability in AI models to improve human-AI communication efficiency.

Method: The approach uses simulated reference games between models involving photographs and tangram images, requiring no additional human-produced data. The training combines both success and cost factors to elicit convention formation.

Result: Models trained with this method reduced message length by up to 41% while increasing communication success by 15% over interactions. Human listeners responded faster when interacting with convention-forming models.

Conclusion: Both success and cost factors are necessary for training models to form conventions - training based on either factor alone is insufficient. The method enables efficient human-AI communication through learned linguistic conventions.

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

TL;DR: Pie is a programmable LLM serving system that decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained handlers, allowing user-provided programs (inferlets) to control generation processes and implement custom optimizations without modifying the serving system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems use monolithic token generation loops that struggle with diverse reasoning strategies and agentic workflows in modern LLM applications, limiting flexibility and efficiency.

Method: Pie decomposes the generation loop into fine-grained service handlers exposed via API, delegates control to user programs (inferlets), and executes them using WebAssembly for lightweight sandboxing.

Result: Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows through application-specific optimizations.

Conclusion: Pie provides a flexible and efficient programmable serving system that enables applications to implement custom KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and integrate computation/I/O without system modifications, addressing limitations of traditional monolithic serving approaches.

Abstract: Emerging large language model (LLM) applications involve diverse reasoning
strategies and agentic workflows, straining the capabilities of existing

introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and
efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained
service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation
process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications
to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly
integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without
requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using
WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows
Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency
overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x
higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: HalloMTBench is a multilingual benchmark designed to detect hallucinations in LLM-based machine translation across 11 language directions, revealing specific failure patterns like model scale effects, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and RL-amplified language mixing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT benchmarks fail to expose hallucinations in multilingual LLMs, creating a need for specialized diagnostic tools to identify and understand these translation failures.

Method: Created a diagnostic framework with taxonomy separating Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment, curated 5,435 human-verified instances across 11 English-to-X directions using 4 frontier LLMs and expert validation.

Result: Evaluation of 17 LLMs revealed distinct hallucination triggers including model scale effects, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and RL-amplified language mixing.

Conclusion: HalloMTBench provides a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing LLM translation failures and understanding hallucination patterns in multilingual translation systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

TL;DR: Global PIQA is a culturally-specific commonsense reasoning benchmark covering 116 languages, created by 335 researchers from 65 countries, with over 50% of examples referencing local cultural elements. LLMs show performance gaps in lower-resource languages despite overall good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for LLMs that cover diverse languages and cultures globally, creating a need for comprehensive evaluation tools that account for cultural context.

Method: Constructed a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark through manual creation by 335 researchers from 65 countries, covering 116 language varieties across 5 continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform well overall but show significant performance gaps in lower-resource languages (up to 37% accuracy gap), with open models generally performing worse than proprietary models. Over 50% of examples reference culturally-specific elements.

Conclusion: Everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement in many languages and cultures, alongside complex reasoning capabilities. The benchmark highlights the cultural diversity embedded in human language and provides a tool for evaluating LLMs across diverse cultural contexts.

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic research on computational processing of Bengali dialects is limited despite the language's considerable dialectal diversity across South Asia and diasporic communities, shaped by geography, culture, and history.

Method: The study documents and analyzes phonetic and morphological properties of Bengali dialects, and explores building computational models including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional varieties.

Result: The research created a dataset for public use and demonstrated the feasibility of building computational models for Bengali dialects, particularly ASR systems for regional varieties.

Conclusion: The efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants and broader language technologies, contributing to both preservation of dialectal diversity and advancement of inclusive digital tools for Bengali-speaking communities.

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning can significantly enhance LLM agent capabilities beyond prompt-based approaches by learning from experience.

Method: Used Reinforcement Learning to train a 14 Billion parameter LLM agent on a legal document search benchmark, exploring turn-restricted regimes during training and testing.

Result: The RL-trained model achieved 85% accuracy, outperforming frontier class models (78% accuracy), with better performance in longer multi-turn horizons.

Conclusion: RL training enables LLM agents to achieve superior performance on complex tasks compared to prompt-based approaches, particularly when operating over extended multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage multiple turns and tools to
solve complex tasks, with prompt-based approaches achieving strong performance.
This work demonstrates that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can push capabilities
significantly further by learning from experience. Through experiments on a

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces pattern-aware line-level deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF) to improve traditional text filtering methods by considering sequential document structure, resulting in better language model performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional line-level filtering techniques like deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters often discard valuable content that negatively affects downstream performance, creating a need for more sophisticated filtering approaches.

Method: The authors enhance conventional filtering techniques by developing pattern-aware line-level deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF), which consider both line-level signals and their sequential distribution across documents to preserve structurally important content.

Result: When training small language models (1B parameters) in English and Korean, the proposed methods consistently improved performance on multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhanced generative question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

Conclusion: The pattern-aware filtering approaches effectively retain valuable content that traditional methods would discard, leading to improved language model performance across different languages and evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MuSaG is the first German multimodal sarcasm detection dataset with 33 minutes of TV show content, featuring aligned text, audio, and video modalities with human annotations. Benchmarking shows models perform best on text while humans rely more on audio, revealing gaps in current multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection is challenging for natural language understanding and extends beyond text with multimodal models. There's a need for German multimodal sarcasm datasets to address this gap and develop models suitable for realistic conversational scenarios.

Method: Created MuSaG dataset from German TV shows with human-annotated text, audio, and video modalities. Benchmarked 9 open-source and commercial models across text, audio, vision, and multimodal architectures, comparing performance to human annotations.

Result: Models perform best on text modality, while humans rely heavily on audio in conversational settings. This reveals a significant gap between current multimodal models and human perception in sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: MuSaG dataset addresses the need for German multimodal sarcasm detection resources and highlights limitations in current multimodal models that don't align with human reliance on audio cues in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in
conversational settings, models perform best on text. This highlights a gap in
current multimodal models and motivates the use of MuSaG for developing models
better suited to realistic scenarios. We release MuSaG publicly to support
future research on multimodal sarcasm detection and human-model alignment.

TL;DR: This paper introduces KITGI, a benchmark for evaluating how external knowledge from ConceptNet affects commonsense generation in NLG. Using T5-Large, they show that removing key knowledge relations drastically reduces generation quality from 91% to 6% correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of external knowledge integration in Natural Language Generation, particularly for commonsense generation tasks, and to create an interpretability benchmark that reveals the importance of relevant knowledge.

Method: Extended CommonGen dataset to create KITGI benchmark with ConceptNet relations and manual annotations. Used T5-Large model to compare generation with full vs filtered knowledge through a three-stage interpretability method: removing key knowledge, regenerating sentences, and manual assessment.

Result: Sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91% correctness in commonsense plausibility and concept coverage, while filtering reduced performance to just 6%, showing drastic degradation when relevant knowledge is removed.

Conclusion: Relevant external knowledge is critical for maintaining coherence and concept coverage in NLG. The work emphasizes the need for interpretable, knowledge-enhanced systems and evaluation frameworks that capture underlying reasoning beyond surface metrics.

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

*Jian Gu,Aldeida Aleti,Chunyang Chen,Hongyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a parametric knowledge transfer (PKT) method for LLMs using activations as the medium for layer-wise knowledge transfer, addressing neural incompatibility issues across different model scales through semantic alignment in latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for transferring knowledge between LLMs of different scales are limited due to neural incompatibility (architectural and parametric differences), making it difficult to achieve fine-grained parametric knowledge transfer effectively and efficiently.

Method: The approach uses activations as the medium for layer-wise knowledge transfer instead of directly reusing layer parameters, leveraging semantic alignment in latent space to overcome neural incompatibility issues.

Result: The method outperforms prior work and better aligns model behaviors across varying scales, as demonstrated by evaluations on four benchmarks. Further analysis reveals key factors that ease cross-scale knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Semantic alignment in latent space is identified as the fundamental prerequisite for effective cross-scale LLM knowledge transfer, and the proposed activation-based approach provides a simple yet effective solution that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new framework for categorizing LLM hallucinations along knowledge and certainty axes, showing that different types require tailored mitigation strategies and revealing critical cases where models hallucinate with certainty despite having correct knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research categorizes hallucinations by external properties rather than internal mechanisms, overlooking that different underlying causes may require tailored mitigation strategies.

Method: Proposed a framework categorizing hallucinations along knowledge and certainty axes, with model-specific dataset construction. Used steering mitigation to validate knowledge categorization and introduced a new evaluation metric for certainty-based hallucinations.

Result: Validated knowledge categorization showing significant differences between lack-of-knowledge vs knowledge-present hallucinations. Found distinct hallucination patterns between models despite shared parametric knowledge. Identified critical cases where models hallucinate with certainty despite having correct knowledge internally.

Conclusion: Both knowledge and certainty are crucial for hallucination analysis, requiring targeted mitigation approaches that consider underlying factors rather than just external properties.

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

### [105] [Towards Transparent Reasoning: What Drives Faithfulness in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24236)
*Teague McMillan,Gabriele Dominici,Martin Gjoreski,Marc Langheinrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how inference and training choices affect the faithfulness of LLM explanations in healthcare contexts, finding that few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and instruction-tuning significantly impact explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce unfaithful explanations that don't reflect their actual reasoning, which is particularly problematic in healthcare where such explanations can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decisions.

Method: Evaluated three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing) datasets, manipulating few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedures to measure explanation faithfulness.

Result: Both quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact faithfulness; faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; instruction-tuning improves faithfulness on MedQA.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for enhancing LLM interpretability and trustworthiness in sensitive domains like healthcare through careful deployment choices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

*Ahmad Ghannam,Naif Alharthi,Faris Alasmary,Kholood Al Tabash,Shouq Sadah,Lahouari Ghouti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal approach combining text and speech for Arabic dialectal diacritic restoration, using CATT encoder for text and Whisper for speech with two integration strategies: early fusion and cross-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Arabic dialectal diacritic restoration by leveraging both textual and speech information, addressing the limitations of text-only approaches.

Method: Uses CATT encoder for text processing and Whisper encoder for speech. Implements two integration strategies: early fusion with linear projection of speech tokens, and cross-attention fusion. Includes speech input deactivation during training for robustness.

Result: Achieved WER of 0.25 and CER of 0.9 on development set; WER of 0.55 and CER of 0.13 on test set.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach effectively combines text and speech for Arabic diacritic restoration, with cross-attention strategy showing promising results and model demonstrating robustness to missing speech input.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

*Syed Zohaib Hassan,Pål Halvorsen,Miriam S. Johnson,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates five LLMs for generating age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for children aged 5 and 9 years, finding that most models produce language that is too advanced for the target age groups despite some models performing relatively well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are predominantly trained on adult conversational data, creating challenges for generating authentic child-like dialogue needed for specialized applications involving children.

Method: Comparative study evaluating five LLMs through blind evaluation by eleven education professionals using real child interview data and LLM-generated text samples to assess authenticity and developmental appropriateness.

Result: Evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75) and showed higher accuracy in age prediction for 5-year-olds vs 9-year-olds. GPT-4 and NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, but most models generated language perceived as more linguistically advanced than target age groups.

Conclusion: Findings highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for specialized applications involving children, especially in low-resource languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

### [108] [From Memorization to Reasoning in the Spectrum of Loss Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256)
*Jack Merullo,Srihita Vatsavaya,Lucius Bushnaq,Owen Lewis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to identify and remove memorized data from transformer models by analyzing loss landscape curvature, showing that memorization corresponds to sharp curvature components in model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memorization is represented in transformer models and develop effective methods to remove it while maintaining model performance on general tasks.

Method: Using loss landscape curvature decomposition to identify memorized components in model weights, followed by a weight editing procedure that suppresses high-curvature components associated with memorization.

Result: The editing procedure effectively reduces recitation of memorized data more than existing unlearning methods while maintaining lower perplexity. However, it negatively affects specific tasks like fact retrieval and arithmetic that rely on specialized weight directions.

Conclusion: Memorization can be disentangled through curvature analysis, and its removal reveals that certain tasks depend on specialized, narrowly-used weight structures rather than general-purpose mechanisms.

Abstract: We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and
show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs)
and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss
landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical
work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper
than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low
curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a
weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted
memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method
(BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of
curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights,
we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks
in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and
consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and
general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on
specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms,
regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support
this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with
low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance
after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural
networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence
for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math
and fact retrieval.

*Ziqi Ma,Sao Mai Nguyen,Philippe Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can translate natural language to symbolic representations from hierarchical RL, but performance depends on partition granularity and task complexity, revealing limitations in representation alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can translate human natural language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge during hierarchical reinforcement learning, which is critical for enabling developmental learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks.

Method: Apply a structured evaluation framework to measure translation performance of GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok LLMs across different internal symbolic partitions generated by hierarchical reinforcement learning in Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments.

Result: LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into symbolic representations of environment dynamics, but performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in representation alignment capacity, highlighting the need for further research on robust alignment between language and internal agent representations.

Abstract: Emergent symbolic representations are critical for enabling developmental
learning agents to plan and generalize across tasks. In this work, we
investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can translate human natural
language instructions into the internal symbolic representations that emerge
during hierarchical reinforcement learning. We apply a structured evaluation
framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT,
Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions
generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze
and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate
some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of
the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition
granularity and task complexity. The results expose limitations in current LLMs
capacity for representation alignment, highlighting the need for further
research on robust alignment between language and internal agent
representations.

*Mădălina Zgreabăn,Tejaswini Deoskar,Lasha Abzianidze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MERGE, a method for automatically generating reasoning-preserving variants of NLI problems by replacing open-class words, revealing that models perform 4-20% worse on these minimally altered problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of NLI benchmarks is costly, and automatic generation of high-quality variants is difficult. Existing benchmarks show language models' lack of robustness in NLI, but there's a need for efficient methods to test generalization.

Method: Proposed MERGE methodology: automatically generate high-quality NLI variants by replacing open-class words while preserving underlying reasoning structure. Creates minimal expression replacements to test generalization.

Result: NLI models perform 4-20% worse on reasoning-preserving variants compared to original problems, indicating low generalizability even with minimal alterations. Performance influenced by word class, probability, and plausibility of replacements.

Conclusion: Current NLI models lack robustness and show poor generalization even on minimally altered problems. The MERGE framework provides an efficient way to evaluate model generalization capabilities in NLI tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

*Shangyu Xing,Siyuan Wang,Chenyuan Yang,Xinyu Dai,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LATR is a novel rollout strategy that enhances trajectory diversity in RLVR by branching at high-uncertainty steps, performing lookahead simulations, and pruning similar branches, achieving 131% faster learning and 4.2% performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR pipelines suffer from limited trajectory diversity during group rollouts due to token-level stochastic sampling, which leads to homogeneous reasoning paths and diminished return signals for policy learning.

Method: LATR operates in three iterative stages: branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, performing lookahead simulation for each branch, and pruning branches that show prolonged similarity during simulation.

Result: LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and DAPO algorithms across different reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LATR effectively addresses the trajectory diversity bottleneck in RLVR pipelines and demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency and performance across multiple algorithms and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Critique-RL is an online reinforcement learning approach that trains critiquing language models without stronger supervision, using a two-player paradigm where an actor generates responses and a critic provides feedback, with a two-stage optimization strategy to improve both discriminability and helpfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for training critiquing language models typically require stronger supervisors for annotating critique data, which limits scalability and practical application. The authors aim to develop a method that can train effective critics without relying on such supervision.

Method: Critique-RL uses a two-player paradigm: actor generates responses, critic provides feedback, and actor refines responses. It employs a two-stage optimization: Stage I reinforces critic discriminability with direct rule-based rewards, Stage II introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve helpfulness while maintaining discriminability through regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements across various tasks and models. For Qwen2.5-7B, it achieves 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Critique-RL demonstrates the potential of training effective critiquing language models without stronger supervision, achieving significant performance gains through its two-stage optimization approach that balances discriminability and helpfulness.

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes LLM performance on culturally grounded Arabic content, showing models underperform on dialects and struggle with open-ended questions despite Arabic-centric models excelling at multiple-choice formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform unevenly on culturally grounded and dialectal content across languages, particularly for Arabic dialects, highlighting the need for more inclusive evaluation methods.

Method: Comprehensive approach: (i) translate MSA questions to English and Arabic dialects, (ii) convert to open-ended questions, (iii) benchmark LLMs under MCQ and OEQ settings, (iv) generate CoT rationales for fine-tuning step-by-step reasoning.

Result: Models underperform on Arabic dialects, Arabic-centric models excel at MCQs but struggle with OEQs, and CoT improves judged correctness with mixed n-gram metrics.

Conclusion: Persistent gaps exist in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge, with the developed dataset supporting further research on linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on
culturally and linguistically inclusive evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongWeave is a new benchmark for evaluating long-form generation in LLMs that balances real-world relevance with verifiable assessment using Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for long-form generation either use real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or synthetic setups that overlook real-world intricacies, creating a gap in rigorous evaluation.

Method: Uses Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval) which defines verifiable targets within real-world scenarios, then systematically generates corresponding queries, textual materials, and constraints based on these targets.

Result: Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world complexity and output length increase.

Conclusion: LongWeave provides a balanced approach for assessing long-form generation capabilities, revealing that current models struggle with complex real-world constraints and longer outputs.

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

TL;DR: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to reconstruct original texts, and this property is leveraged for text simplification by learning transformations between high-complexity and low-complexity embedding spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether sentence embeddings preserve text complexity levels and whether transformations in embedding space can effectively simplify text without requiring large models.

Method: Used a small feed forward neural network to learn transformations between sentence embeddings representing high-complexity and low-complexity texts, comparing with Seq2Seq and LLM-based approaches.

Result: The transformation approach showed encouraging results in small learning settings, successfully generalized to unseen simplification datasets (MedEASI) and languages outside training data (Spanish, German).

Conclusion: Learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction for developing small but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language generation tasks.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings can be decoded to give approximations of the original
texts used to create them. We explore this effect in the context of text
simplification, demonstrating that reconstructed text embeddings preserve
complexity levels. We experiment with a small feed forward neural network to
effectively learn a transformation between sentence embeddings representing
high-complexity and low-complexity texts. We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq
and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller
learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as
datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE). We conclude that
learning transformations in sentence embedding space is a promising direction
for future research and has potential to unlock the ability to develop small,
but powerful models for text simplification and other natural language
generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPEFFDIST is a knowledge distillation framework for sentiment analysis that uses automatic instruction construction and data filtering to create efficient 3B models that match 20x larger teacher models using only 10% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sentiment analysis distillation methods face limitations: manually written instructions lack diversity and large-scale user texts are computationally expensive, hindering practical deployment.

Method: The framework uses two modules: attribute-based automatic instruction construction to generate diverse instructions, and difficulty-based data filtering to reduce computational costs while maintaining effectiveness.

Result: 3B student models achieved performance comparable to 20x larger teacher models on most tasks, with 10x better data efficiency than baseline methods.

Conclusion: COMPEFFDIST provides an effective and efficient solution for sentiment analysis distillation, enabling small models to achieve large model performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthWorlds is a framework that disentangles reasoning from factual knowledge in language models by creating parallel real and synthetic worlds with identical structure, enabling precise evaluation of reasoning ability independent of memorized knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for language models cannot cleanly separate reasoning ability from factual recall, as benchmark performance often reflects memorized knowledge rather than genuine reasoning.

Method: Construct parallel corpora with identical interconnected structure: real-mapped world (where models can use parametric knowledge) and synthetic-mapped world (where such knowledge is meaningless), then design mirrored tasks like multi-hop QA and page navigation.

Result: Experiments reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap - models gain performance boost from memorized knowledge. Knowledge acquisition mechanisms reduce but don't eliminate this gap.

Conclusion: SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for precise evaluation of reasoning vs memorization in language models, enabling testable comparisons that were previously challenging.

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

Motivation: To address the limitation of instruction-tuned LLMs in low-resource linguistic settings like Luxembourgish due to lack of high-quality training data.

Method: Created LuxIT dataset by synthesizing from native Luxembourgish texts using DeepSeek-R1-0528, applied LLM-as-a-judge quality assurance, and fine-tuned several smaller-scale LLMs on the dataset.

Result: Benchmarking on Luxembourgish language proficiency exams showed mixed results with significant performance variation across different models.

Conclusion: LuxIT represents a valuable contribution to Luxembourgish NLP and offers a replicable methodology, but further research is needed to optimize its application given the inconsistent performance results.

Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) is often
limited in low-resource linguistic settings due to a lack of high-quality
training data. We introduce LuxIT, a novel, monolingual instruction tuning
dataset for Luxembourgish developed to mitigate this challenge. We synthesize
the dataset from a corpus of native Luxembourgish texts, utilizing
DeepSeek-R1-0528, chosen for its shown proficiency in Luxembourgish. Following
generation, we apply a quality assurance process, employing an LLM-as-a-judge
approach. To investigate the practical utility of the dataset, we fine-tune
several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings
highlight the need for further research to optimize its application.

Motivation: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance but risk misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally inconsistent responses, necessitating systematic evaluation.

Method: Dual-agent framework with quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and qualitative agent for five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (Tone, Depth, Originality) on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs.

Result: GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). GPT-4o had highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led qualitative pairwise wins (116/200).

Conclusion: Models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic content and citations, underscoring need for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives for more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for Islamic guidance, but risk
misquoting texts, misapplying jurisprudence, or producing culturally
inconsistent responses. We pilot an evaluation of GPT-4o, Ansari AI, and Fanar
on prompts from authentic Islamic blogs. Our dual-agent framework uses a
quantitative agent for citation verification and six-dimensional scoring (e.g.,
Structure, Islamic Consistency, Citations) and a qualitative agent for
five-dimensional side-by-side comparison (e.g., Tone, Depth, Originality).
GPT-4o scored highest in Islamic Accuracy (3.93) and Citation (3.38), Ansari AI
followed (3.68, 3.32), and Fanar lagged (2.76, 1.82). Despite relatively strong
performance, models still fall short in reliably producing accurate Islamic
content and citations -- a paramount requirement in faith-sensitive writing.
GPT-4o had the highest mean quantitative score (3.90/5), while Ansari AI led
qualitative pairwise wins (116/200). Fanar, though trailing, introduces
innovations for Islamic and Arabic contexts. This study underscores the need
for community-driven benchmarks centering Muslim perspectives, offering an
early step toward more reliable AI in Islamic knowledge and other high-stakes
domains such as medicine, law, and journalism.

### [120] [SPARTA: Evaluating Reasoning Segmentation Robustness through Black-Box Adversarial Paraphrasing in Text Autoencoder Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24446)
*Viktoriia Zinkovich,Anton Antonov,Andrei Spiridonov,Denis Shepelev,Andrey Moskalenko,Daria Pugacheva,Elena Tutubalina,Andrey Kuznetsov,Vlad Shakhuro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARTA, a black-box adversarial paraphrasing method that generates semantically equivalent but grammatically correct textual queries to degrade segmentation performance in multimodal LLMs, achieving 2x higher success rates than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on perturbing image inputs, but semantically equivalent textual paraphrases remain underexplored despite being crucial in real-world applications where users express the same intent in varied ways.

Method: SPARTA - a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning.

Result: SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets, revealing that advanced reasoning segmentation models remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing even under strict semantic and grammatical constraints.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the vulnerability of multimodal LLMs to adversarial paraphrasing attacks and provides a comprehensive evaluation protocol for assessing model robustness against such attacks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

*Špela Vintar,Taja Kuzman Pungeršek,Mojca Brglez,Nikola Ljubešić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new taxonomy and best practices for multilingual LLM benchmarking, focusing on European languages and advocating for greater language and culture sensitivity in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in LLM benchmarking for non-English languages, as current benchmarks primarily focus on English despite the growing capabilities of multilingual models.

Method: The authors provide an overview of recent LLM benchmarking developments and propose a new taxonomy specifically designed for multilingual scenarios, along with quality standards for coordinated benchmark development.

Result: The paper results in a proposed taxonomy for categorizing multilingual benchmarks and a set of best practices for developing more culturally and linguistically sensitive evaluation methods for European languages.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need for more coordinated development of multilingual benchmarks with higher sensitivity to language and cultural differences, particularly for European languages.

Abstract: While new benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are being developed
continuously to catch up with the growing capabilities of new models and AI in
general, using and evaluating LLMs in non-English languages remains a
little-charted landscape. We give a concise overview of recent developments in
LLM benchmarking, and then propose a new taxonomy for the categorization of
benchmarks that is tailored to multilingual or non-English use scenarios. We
further propose a set of best practices and quality standards that could lead
to a more coordinated development of benchmarks for European languages. Among
other recommendations, we advocate for a higher language and culture
sensitivity of evaluation methods.

*Durga Prasad Maram,Dhruvin Gandhi,Zonghai Yao,Gayathri Akkinapalli,Franck Dernoncourt,Yu Wang,Ryan A. Rossi,Nesreen K. Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerFine is a training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalized text generation through iterative, profile-grounded feedback, improving personalization over existing methods without requiring model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented approaches for personalized text generation often produce outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style, failing to fully align with target users' preferences.

Method: Uses iterative feedback loop: LLM generator creates drafts conditioned on retrieved profiles, critic LLM provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality, generator revises with knockout strategy to retain stronger drafts across iterations.

Result: Consistent improvements over PGraphRAG across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size.

Conclusion: Post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of methods for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in data-scarce scenarios, covering parameter-efficient techniques, domain/cross-lingual adaptation, model specialization, and preference alignment approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with limited data is challenging in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained deployment settings, requiring focused and efficient techniques despite strong pre-trained foundations.

Method: Systematic review of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for encoder and decoder models, model specialization strategies, and preference alignment approaches using limited human or synthetic feedback.

Result: The survey provides empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints including model scaling, data scaling, and catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

Conclusion: The paper aims to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited, addressing practical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with limited data poses a practical
challenge in low-resource languages, specialized domains, and constrained
deployment settings. While pre-trained LLMs provide strong foundations,
effective adaptation under data scarcity requires focused and efficient
fine-tuning techniques. This paper presents a structured and practical survey
of recent methods for fine-tuning LLMs in data-scarce scenarios. We
systematically review parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques that lower
training and deployment costs, domain and cross-lingual adaptation methods for
both encoder and decoder models, and model specialization strategies. We
further examine preference alignment approaches that guide model behavior using
limited human or synthetic feedback, emphasizing sample and compute efficiency.
Throughout, we highlight empirical trade-offs, selection criteria, and best
practices for choosing suitable techniques based on task constraints, including
model scaling, data scaling, and the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting. The
aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with actionable insights for
effectively fine-tuning LLMs when data and resources are limited.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This survey analyzes how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and reasoning enhancement work synergistically in Agentic Systems to mitigate hallucinations in large language models, proposing a taxonomy of knowledge-based vs logic-based hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination remains a key obstacle for reliable LLM deployment, and while RAG and reasoning enhancement are effective mitigation strategies, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms haven't been systematically examined.

Method: Adopts an application-oriented perspective to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. Proposes a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations.

Result: Systematically examines how RAG and reasoning address different types of hallucinations and presents a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The integration of RAG and reasoning enhancement in Agentic Systems represents a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to balancing creativity and reliability in LLM deployment.

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps scientific presentations to relevant papers, and presents Talk2Ref, a large-scale dataset of 6,279 talks with 43,429 cited papers for training models on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific talks are increasingly important for research dissemination, and automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches talks would be valuable for researchers and students.

Method: The authors establish baselines using state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval, propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref, and explore strategies for handling long transcripts and domain adaptation.

Result: Fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of the task and the effectiveness of the dataset for learning semantic representations from spoken scientific content.

Conclusion: The dataset and trained models are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating
spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

### [126] [A word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs compared to humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24488)
*Katherine Abramski,Giulio Rossetti,Massimo Stella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs by simulating semantic priming, enabling direct comparisons between LLMs and humans across various social bias dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more integrated into daily life, their inherent social biases remain a concern. Detecting implicit biases is challenging, requiring evaluation methods that assess LLMs' implicit knowledge representations.

Method: Prompt-based word association network approach that simulates semantic priming within LLM-generated networks, tapping into implicit relational structures to provide quantitative and qualitative bias assessments.

Result: Application to humans and multiple LLMs revealed both convergences and divergences in social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party, providing new perspectives on LLM risks.

Conclusion: The methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across LLMs and humans, advancing transparent and socially responsible language technologies.

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

*Qing Zong,Jiayu Liu,Tianshi Zheng,Chunyang Li,Baixuan Xu,Haochen Shi,Weiqi Wang,Zhaowei Wang,Chunkit Chan,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes natural language critiques for LLM confidence calibration, showing confidence critiques work better for multiple-choice tasks while uncertainty critiques excel in open-ended scenarios. It introduces Self-Critique and CritiCal methods, with CritiCal significantly outperforming baselines and even GPT-4o in complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate confidence calibration in LLMs is critical for safe use in high-stakes domains, as traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment. Natural language critiques are proposed as a solution since precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain and often require multiple generations.

Method: The paper studies natural language critiques for confidence calibration, addressing what to critique (uncertainty vs confidence) and how to critique. It proposes Self-Critique for LLMs to critique and optimize their confidence, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence calibration beyond direct numerical optimization.

Result: Experiments show that CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive baselines, even surpassing its teacher model GPT-4o in complex reasoning tasks. CritiCal also demonstrates robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: Natural language critiques effectively enhance LLM confidence calibration, with CritiCal advancing LLM's reliability through improved calibration performance and robust generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

### [128] [Levée d'ambiguïtés par grammaires locales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24530)
*Eric G. C. Laporte*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a lexical disambiguation method for part-of-speech tagging that aims for zero silence rate, implemented in INTEX system. It emphasizes the need to verify transducer interactions and test local grammars carefully when targeting zero silence rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many words are ambiguous in their part-of-speech, but context reduces this ambiguity. Lexical tagging is crucial for natural language processing applications like spelling correction, grammar checking, and text-to-speech conversion. The goal is to achieve zero silence rate where correct tags are never discarded.

Method: The method involves a lexical disambiguation approach implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system, using local disambiguation grammars with transducers. It requires verifying transducer interactions rather than considering paths separately, and careful testing of local grammars.

Result: The paper shows that verifying local disambiguation grammars requires considering transducer interactions, not just individual paths. When combining multiple transducers, results cannot be predicted by examining them in isolation. Grammatical intuitions for disambiguation rules may be inaccurate due to unforeseen constructions.

Conclusion: To achieve zero silence rate in lexical tagging, local grammars must be carefully tested and verified, with detailed specifications of what grammars will do when applied to texts. Transducer interactions must be considered rather than analyzing them separately.

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

*Venkata S Govindarajan,Laura Biester*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes 'bad' humor using sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, finding that standard humor detection models fail on this corpus and that LLMs over-exaggerate literary devices when generating similar content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the diversity of textual humor, including intentionally bad humor, by studying a novel corpus from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest.

Method: Curated and analyzed a corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, evaluated standard humor detection models on this corpus, analyzed literary devices used, and tested LLMs for generating similar content.

Result: Standard humor detection models performed poorly on the corpus. The sentences combine features from existing humor datasets (puns, irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs imitated the form but exaggerated effects by over-using certain literary devices and including more novel adjective-noun bigrams than humans.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into 'bad' humor characteristics and shows that LLMs can replicate form but exaggerate stylistic elements compared to human writers.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account
for this range, including intentionally bad humor. In this paper, we curate and
analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Open Korean Historical Corpus is a large-scale dataset spanning 1,300 years that enables quantitative analysis of Korean linguistic evolution, including the shift from Chinese characters to Hangul and North Korea's lexical divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible historical corpora for studying Korean linguistic evolution, which has remained largely unexplored in NLP despite significant discrepancies between spoken and written forms and the pivotal shift from Chinese characters to Hangul.

Method: Created the Open Korean Historical Corpus - a large-scale, openly licensed dataset containing 18 million documents and 5 billion tokens from 19 sources spanning 7th century to 2025, covering 6 languages and under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and Hanja-Hangul mixed script.

Result: Quantitative analysis revealed: (1) Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; (3) North Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times higher out-of-vocabulary rates.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational resource for quantitative diachronic analysis of Korean language history and can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language models to improve their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in modern Hangul and archaic writing systems.

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

*Raphaël Bagat,Irina Illina,Emmanuel Vincent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BEARD is a novel framework that adapts Whisper's encoder using unlabeled data through BEST-RQ objective and knowledge distillation, achieving 12% relative improvement in ASR performance for Air Traffic Control domain with only 2 hours of transcribed data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled data is scarce, particularly in specialized domains like Air Traffic Control with non-native speech, noise, and specialized phraseology.

Method: BEARD combines BEST-RQ self-supervised learning objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen teacher encoder, using about 5,000 hours of untranscribed speech for adaptation while maintaining complementarity with the pre-trained decoder.

Result: The approach significantly outperforms previous baseline and fine-tuned models, achieving 12% relative improvement compared to fine-tuned model on the ATCO2 corpus with only 2 hours of transcribed speech for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: This is the first work to use self-supervised learning for domain adaptation of Whisper, demonstrating effective adaptation to challenging domains with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReplicationBench is an evaluation framework that tests AI agents' ability to replicate entire astrophysics research papers, assessing both faithfulness to original methods and technical correctness of results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate AI agents as scientific research assistants by assessing their faithfulness and correctness in replicating novel research, since astrophysics provides a good testbed due to its reliance on archival data and computational study.

Method: Split astrophysics papers into tasks requiring agents to replicate core contributions (experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, codebase), co-developed with original authors to target key scientific results.

Result: Current frontier language models perform poorly, with the best models scoring under 20%, revealing diverse failure modes for agents in scientific research.

Conclusion: ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark for paper-scale astrophysics research tasks, provides insights generalizable to other data-driven science domains, and offers a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific
research.

### [133] [ReForm: Reflective Autoformalization with Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24592)
*Guoxin Chen,Jing Wu,Xinjie Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ruihua Song,Chengxi Li,Kai Fan,Dayiheng Liu,Minpeng Liao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReForm is a reflective autoformalization method that integrates semantic consistency evaluation to iteratively generate and refine formal statements from natural language mathematics, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches treat autoformalization as simple translation and lack mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement, leading to failures in preserving semantic intent despite generating syntactically correct formal statements.

Method: Proposed ReForm method with Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO) that uses different rewards at different sequence positions to train models for both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations through iterative refinement.

Result: Achieves average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over strongest baselines across four autoformalization benchmarks. Human expert analysis reveals autoformalization is inherently difficult with up to 38.5% semantic errors.

Conclusion: ReForm successfully addresses semantic consistency in autoformalization through reflective processes, and the introduced ConsistencyCheck benchmark validates both the method's effectiveness and the inherent difficulty of the task.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

### [134] [Diffusion LLM with Native Variable Generation Lengths: Let [EOS] Lead the Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24605)
*Yicun Yang,Cong Wang,Shaobo Wang,Zichen Wen,Biqing Qi,Hanlin Xu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes dLLM-Var, a diffusion-based LLM with variable generation lengths that predicts [EOS] tokens to enable flexible text generation without fixed length constraints, achieving significant speed improvements over traditional dLLMs and autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based LLMs suffer from fixed generation lengths that must be predetermined as hyperparameters, leading to efficiency and flexibility issues in text generation.

Method: Train a diffusion LLM to accurately predict [EOS] tokens, enabling native variable-length generation while maintaining global bi-directional attention and high parallelism through block diffusion inference.

Result: Achieves 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference and 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models like Qwen and Llama, with higher accuracy on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method makes dLLMs practical for real-world applications by enabling faster, more flexible generation with variable lengths, elevating them beyond academic novelty.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

### [135] [Long-Context Modeling with Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention for On-Device LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24606)
*Siheng Xiong,Joe Zou,Faramarz Fekri,Yae Jee Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DHSA is a dynamic hierarchical sparse attention method that reduces computational costs for long-context LLMs while maintaining accuracy through adaptive chunking and length-normalized aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static sparse attention methods poorly adapt to content-dependent variations in attention, while dynamic approaches rely on predefined templates that limit generality and accuracy across diverse tasks.

Method: DHSA dynamically segments sequences into variable-length chunks, computes chunk representations using length-normalized aggregation, and upsamples chunk-level similarity scores to token level to determine which interactions to preserve.

Result: DHSA matches dense attention accuracy while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%, achieving 6-18% relative accuracy gains over other baselines with comparable or lower cost.

Conclusion: DHSA offers an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs by dynamically predicting attention sparsity without retraining, maintaining accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

*Snegha A,Sayambhu Sen,Piyush Singh Pasi,Abhishek Singhania,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prefix-based methods outperform LoRA for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ languages, achieving up to 6% improvement on Belebele benchmark with Llama 3.1 8B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore less-studied prefix-based techniques (soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, Llama Adapter) for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in decoder-only LLMs, as parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA are widely used but prefix methods remain under-explored.

Method: Comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages, analyzing transfer across linguistic families and scripts, and scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B.

Result: Prefix methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on Belebele benchmark with Llama 3.1 8B, with similar improvements on Mistral v0.3 7B. Despite using only 1.23M parameters with prefix tuning, consistent improvements were achieved across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Prefix-based techniques are an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA, particularly in low-resource multilingual settings, highlighting their potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

### [137] [Relative Scaling Laws for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24626)
*William Held,David Hall,Percy Liang,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces relative scaling laws to track performance gaps between test distributions as models scale, showing that scaling doesn't uniformly improve all subpopulations despite overall performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scaling laws focus on aggregate performance but obscure disparities across heterogeneous subpopulations. The authors aim to understand how performance gaps evolve with scale rather than just absolute error improvements.

Method: Trained 255 decoder-only Transformers under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from 10^18 to 10^20 FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, then analyzed relative performance trajectories across different test distributions.

Result: Found diverse scaling trajectories: academic domains converge toward parity; regional English dialects shift based on population size; AI risk behaviors split with capability/influence risks increasing while adversarial risks don't.

Conclusion: Scaling improves overall performance but is not a universal equalizer - different subpopulations show varied responses to scale. The authors release all model checkpoints to enable further study of relative scaling laws alongside traditional ones.

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

*Anh Ngo,Nicolas Rollet,Catherine Pelachaud,Chloe Clavel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A multimodal model that detects repair initiation in Dutch dialogues using linguistic and prosodic features, showing prosodic cues significantly improve performance over text and audio embeddings alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational agents often fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to conversation breakdowns and disengagement. This work aims to improve repair detection by integrating multimodal features.

Method: Proposes a multimodal model combining linguistic and prosodic features grounded in Conversation Analysis to automatically detect Other-Initiated Repair (OIR) in Dutch dialogues.

Result: Prosodic cues complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of pretrained text and audio embeddings, revealing how different features interact.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of multimodal approaches for repair detection and suggests future directions including visual cues, multilingual corpora, and cross-context analysis for improved robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Maintaining mutual understanding is a key component in human-human
conversation to avoid conversation breakdowns, in which repair, particularly
Other-Initiated Repair (OIR, when one speaker signals trouble and prompts the
other to resolve), plays a vital role. However, Conversational Agents (CAs)
still fail to recognize user repair initiation, leading to breakdowns or
disengagement. This work proposes a multimodal model to automatically detect
repair initiation in Dutch dialogues by integrating linguistic and prosodic
features grounded in Conversation Analysis. The results show that prosodic cues
complement linguistic features and significantly improve the results of
pretrained text and audio embeddings, offering insights into how different
features interact. Future directions include incorporating visual cues,
exploring multilingual and cross-context corpora to assess the robustness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: OpenRM is a tool-augmented reward model that uses external tools to gather evidence for evaluating knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks, outperforming existing reward models and improving LLM alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle with knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks where evaluating correctness requires external evidence beyond the model's internal knowledge, limiting their ability to reliably discriminate subtle quality differences.

Method: Train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples, jointly supervising intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy to learn evidence-based judgment strategies.

Result: OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used benchmarks, and integration into inference-time response selection and training-time data selection yields consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented reward models like OpenRM have significant potential for scaling reliable long-form evaluation and improving LLM alignment.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

*Hugo Rydel-Johnston,Alex Kafkas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes dyslexic reading costs using eye-tracking data and word-level features (length, frequency, predictability), finding that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to all three features, especially predictability, with counterfactual manipulations reducing the dyslexic-control gap by about one third.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where and under what conditions dyslexic reading costs arise in naturalistic reading, and to quantify how word-level features influence these costs.

Method: Used eye-tracking aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability) in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset, modeling how each feature influences dyslexic time costs and conducting counterfactual manipulations.

Result: All three word features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, with dyslexic readers showing stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations narrowed the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability having the strongest effect.

Conclusion: The patterns align with dyslexia theories involving heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. The study provides actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

*Jiawei Zhou,Lei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3 is a retrieval framework for RAG that uses reinforced contrastive learning to dynamically optimize relevance without requiring pre-annotated data, improving RAG performance by 5.2% over original retrievers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As RAG becomes widespread, IR's role shifts from retrieving for humans to AI systems, making relevance difficult to define or annotate beforehand.

Method: R3 enables retrievers to dynamically explore and optimize relevance through trial-and-feedback reinforced contrastive learning, using retrieved results to produce automatic contrastive signals for self-improvement.

Result: R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over original retrievers and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented systems while being efficient (4 GPUs, single-day training).

Conclusion: R3 provides an efficient and practical solution for optimizing retrieval in RAG systems without requiring annotated data, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

TL;DR: A framework for training LLMs as diagnostic agents using reinforcement learning in virtual clinical environments, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art models in diagnostic accuracy and examination recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLMs to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses through interactive exploration rather than static case summaries, addressing limitations of instruction-tuned models.

Method: Developed DiagGym (diagnostics world model trained with EHRs), trained DiagAgent via end-to-end multi-turn reinforcement learning, and created DiagBench benchmark with physician-validated cases and rubrics.

Result: DiagAgent significantly outperformed 10 SOTA LLMs including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, achieving 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy in single-turn settings, 15.12% increase in end-to-end settings, and 7.1% improvement in rubric scores over Claude-sonnet-4.

Conclusion: Learning policies in interactive clinical environments provides dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities that cannot be achieved through passive training alone.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

*Parker Riley,Daniel Deutsch,Mara Finkelstein,Colten DiIanni,Juraj Juraska,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MQM re-annotation, a two-stage human evaluation method for machine translation that improves annotation quality by having annotators review and edit existing MQM annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As machine translation models improve, current evaluation methods become insufficient due to increased evaluation noise, requiring more refined evaluation approaches to accurately measure quality gains.

Method: The authors experiment with MQM re-annotation, where annotators review and edit pre-existing MQM annotations (from human annotators or automatic systems) in a two-stage process.

Result: Re-annotation leads to higher-quality annotations primarily by identifying errors missed in the first pass, and rater behavior aligns with the intended goals of the method.

Conclusion: MQM re-annotation effectively addresses the challenge of evaluating increasingly better machine translation models by improving annotation quality through a two-stage review process.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteractComp is a benchmark for evaluating search agents' ability to recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search, revealing systematic overconfidence in current models despite latent interaction capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search agents assume complete and unambiguous user queries, which diverges from reality where users often begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Existing benchmarks cannot assess this interactive capability.

Method: Created 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains using a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluated 17 models on their ability to recognize ambiguity and engage in interactive clarification.

Result: Best model achieved only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produced dramatic gains, showing latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold.

Conclusion: InteractComp reveals a critical blind spot in search agent development and provides a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities, as the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks makes it particularly suitable for this purpose.

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Role prompts in LLMs for medical decision support primarily affect linguistic style rather than enhancing reasoning capabilities, failing to replicate real-world cognitive complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether role prompts in LLMs induce distinct cognitive processes or merely modify linguistic style in medical decision support systems.

Method: Introduced RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework (RPNA) using neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques on three medical QA datasets.

Result: Role prompts do not significantly enhance medical reasoning abilities; they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features without distinct reasoning pathways across clinical roles.

Conclusion: Current Prompt-Based Role Playing methods fail to replicate cognitive complexity in medical practice, highlighting the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

*Bo Liu,Chuanyang Jin,Seungone Kim,Weizhe Yuan,Wenting Zhao,Ilia Kulikov,Xian Li,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar,Jack Lanchantin,Jason Weston*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE is a reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts as both Challenger (creating reasoning tasks from corpus documents) and Reasoner (solving them), enabling continuous self-improvement through adversarial dynamics and corpus grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improving systems need environmental interaction for continuous adaptation, but existing ungrounded self-play methods offer limited benefits. The motivation is to create a framework that can generate increasingly challenging goals and achieve them through sustained interaction with rich external signals.

Method: SPICE uses a single model in two roles: Challenger mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse reasoning tasks, and Reasoner solves them. This creates adversarial dynamics where the Challenger automatically generates a curriculum at the frontier of the Reasoner's capability, with corpus grounding providing rich external signals.

Result: SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families, outperforming existing ungrounded self-play methods.

Conclusion: Document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE that enables continuous generation of increasingly challenging goals and their achievement, facilitating sustained self-improvement through corpus-based environmental interaction.

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E-GRPO improves LLM-based search agent training by incorporating entity-aware rewards that recognize partial success in reasoning, outperforming standard GRPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training methods like GRPO discard valuable entity information and cannot distinguish between complete failures and 'near-miss' samples with correct reasoning but wrong final answers, missing important learning opportunities.

Method: Introduces Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), which formulates a dense entity-aware reward function that assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples based on their entity match rate with ground-truth entities.

Result: E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms GRPO baseline on diverse QA and deep research benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy while inducing more efficient reasoning policies with fewer tool calls.

Conclusion: E-GRPO provides a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents by leveraging entity information that was previously discarded during training, enabling better learning from near-miss scenarios.

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

*Xuanzhong Chen,Zile Qiao,Guoxin Chen,Liangcai Su,Zhen Zhang,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data within an LLM's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) - tasks the model cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. This enables both continued pre-training and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. The educational theory of ZPD provides a framework to define this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance.

Method: AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. The framework also includes ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark to evaluate agent capabilities on frontier tasks.

Result: The AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model trained on synthesized data achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents.

Conclusion: A ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

*Zhengwei Tao,Haiyang Shen,Baixuan Li,Wenbiao Yin,Jialong Wu,Kuan Li,Zhongwang Zhang,Huifeng Yin,Rui Ye,Liwen Zhang,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebLeaper is a framework that addresses low search efficiency in LLM-based information seeking agents by creating high-coverage tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories through tree-structured reasoning and curated Wikipedia tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current information seeking agents suffer from low search efficiency due to sparse target entities in training tasks, which limits their ability to learn efficient search behaviors and constrains overall performance.

Method: Formulates information seeking as a tree-structured reasoning problem, uses curated Wikipedia tables to synthesize three task variants (Basic, Union, Reverse-Union), and curates training trajectories that are both accurate and efficient.

Result: Extensive experiments on five IS benchmarks (BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, Seal-0) show consistent improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.

Conclusion: WebLeaper successfully addresses search efficiency limitations in LLM-based information seeking agents through systematic task construction and trajectory optimization, achieving better performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

*Baixuan Li,Dingchu Zhang,Jialong Wu,Wenbiao Yin,Zhengwei Tao,Yida Zhao,Liwen Zhang,Haiyang Shen,Runnan Fang,Pengjun Xie,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParallelMuse is a two-stage paradigm that enhances deep information-seeking agents by improving exploration efficiency through functional region partitioning and uncertainty-guided path reuse, and synthesizing answers by compressing reasoning trajectories while maintaining information integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional parallel thinking in information-seeking agents suffers from inefficiency due to repeated rollouts from scratch and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories due to limited context capacity, which hinders comprehensive problem-solving capability.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout - partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching; 2) Compressed Reasoning Aggregation - exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize coherent final answers.

Result: Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks show up to 62% performance improvement with 10-30% reduction in exploratory token consumption.

Conclusion: ParallelMuse effectively addresses the limitations of conventional parallel thinking by improving exploration efficiency and enabling better integration of reasoning trajectories, significantly enhancing the problem-solving capabilities of deep information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Parallel thinking expands exploration breadth, complementing the deep
exploration of information-seeking (IS) agents to further enhance
problem-solving capability. However, conventional parallel thinking faces two
key challenges in this setting: inefficiency from repeatedly rolling out from
scratch, and difficulty in integrating long-horizon reasoning trajectories
during answer generation, as limited context capacity prevents full
consideration of the reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose
ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first
stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences
into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and
branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed
Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress
information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final
answer. Experiments across multiple open-source agents and benchmarks
demonstrate up to 62% performance improvement with a 10--30% reduction in
exploratory token consumption.

### [151] [AgentFold: Long-Horizon Web Agents with Proactive Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24699)
*Rui Ye,Zhongwang Zhang,Kuan Li,Huifeng Yin,Zhengwei Tao,Yida Zhao,Liangcai Su,Liwen Zhang,Zile Qiao,Xinyu Wang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Siheng Chen,Jingren Zhou,Yong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentFold is a novel LLM-based web agent that addresses context saturation in long-horizon tasks through proactive context management inspired by human cognitive processes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation due to accumulating noisy raw histories, while fixed summarization methods risk losing critical details. There's a need for better context management in long-horizon information seeking tasks.

Method: AgentFold treats context as a dynamic cognitive workspace and learns to execute 'folding' operations that manage historical trajectories at multiple scales - granular condensations preserve fine-grained details while deep consolidations abstract away multi-step sub-tasks.

Result: AgentFold-30B-A3B achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH, surpassing or matching much larger open-source models like DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B and proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini, using only supervised fine-tuning without continual pre-training or RL.

Conclusion: AgentFold's proactive context management paradigm effectively addresses the fundamental trade-off in context management for LLM-based web agents, demonstrating superior performance on long-horizon information seeking tasks through intelligent context folding operations.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agent Data Protocol (ADP), a unified representation language that standardizes diverse agent training datasets, enabling scalable supervised fine-tuning of AI agents across multiple domains without domain-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public research on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents is limited due to fragmented data across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces, creating a bottleneck for standardized agent training.

Method: Developed the Agent Data Protocol (ADP) as a light-weight interlingua to unify 13 existing agent datasets into standardized format, then converted ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks and performed supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved ~20% average performance gain over base models and delivered state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks without domain-specific tuning.

Conclusion: ADP successfully lowers the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training by unifying fragmented data sources, with all code and data released publicly to facilitate broader adoption.

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ComboBench is a benchmark evaluating LLMs' ability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from 4 popular VR games, revealing that while top models show strong task decomposition, they still lag humans in procedural reasoning and spatial understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models can effectively replicate humans' intuitive ability to translate high-level semantic actions into precise VR device manipulations using controllers and HMDs, which remains underexplored.

Method: Created ComboBench benchmark with 262 scenarios from 4 VR games (Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, Vivecraft), evaluated 7 LLMs against annotated ground truth and human performance, using few-shot examples to test improvement.

Result: Top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition but struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across games based on interaction complexity, and few-shot examples substantially improve performance.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for VR manipulation tasks but require targeted enhancement to match human capabilities in procedural reasoning and spatial understanding, with few-shot learning offering a viable path for improvement.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve translation evaluation by developing enhanced systems for both quality score prediction and error span detection tasks in the WMT25 shared task.

Method: Used Gemma 3 as base model, with MetricX-25 adapted to encoder-only architecture with regression head for quality scores, and GemSpanEval as decoder-only model for generative error span detection including context output.

Result: MetricX-25 significantly outperforms its predecessor in predicting MQM and ESA quality scores, while GemSpanEval is competitive with xCOMET in error span detection.

Conclusion: Both proposed systems demonstrate strong performance in their respective tasks, with MetricX-25 showing significant improvements over previous versions and GemSpanEval achieving competitive results in error span detection through generative formulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalist game agent that can operate across heterogeneous domains using human-aligned native inputs, enabling large-scale continual pre-training beyond API- or GUI-based limitations.

Method: Uses unified keyboard-mouse action space with 500B token pre-training, decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion, and Sparse-Thinking strategy for efficient reasoning-inference balance.

Result: Achieves 2x success rate over previous SOTA in Minecraft, close to human generality in unseen web 3D games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how artificial intelligence impacts disciplinary creativity in scientific fields, particularly examining whether AI enhances or diminishes creative problem-solving approaches within specific disciplines.

Method: Uses philosophical framework distinguishing creative approaches vs. products, introduces concept of disciplinary creativity, and analyzes two mathematical case studies to examine AI's effects.

Result: Found that computation can extend disciplinary creativity, but certain AI approaches displace it, potentially altering and diminishing the value of scientific pursuit.

Conclusion: AI's impact on scientific creativity is nuanced - while computational tools can enhance disciplinary creativity, some AI applications risk displacing it, which may reduce the intrinsic value of scientific work.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ME-POMDPs extend POMDPs with model uncertainty across multiple environments, aiming to find robust policies that maximize worst-case reward. The paper generalizes them to AB-POMDPs with belief uncertainty, shows reduction possibilities, and develops exact/approximate algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address model uncertainty when multiple domain experts disagree on problem modeling, requiring robust policies that work well across all possible POMDP variations within a set.

Method: Generalize ME-POMDPs to AB-POMDPs with belief uncertainty, prove reductions to simpler forms, and develop exact and point-based approximate algorithms for computing robust policies.

Result: Successfully computed robust policies for standard POMDP benchmarks extended to multi-environment settings, demonstrating practical applicability of the approach.

Conclusion: ME-POMDPs and AB-POMDPs provide effective frameworks for handling model uncertainty, with proposed algorithms enabling robust policy computation for real-world problems with multiple possible models.

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

### [159] [Test-Time Tuned Language Models Enable End-to-end De Novo Molecular Structure Generation from MS/MS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23746)
*Laura Mismetti,Marvin Alberts,Andreas Krause,Mara Graziani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework using test-time tuning enhances pre-trained transformers for de novo molecular structure generation directly from tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 100% and 20% on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on database matching or multi-step pipelines with intermediate predictions, making identification challenging for compounds absent from reference databases.

Method: Leverages test-time tuning to enhance a pre-trained transformer model for end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae.

Result: Surpasses DiffMS by 100% on NPLIB1 and 20% on MassSpecGym benchmarks. Test-time tuning provides 62% performance gain over conventional fine-tuning on MassSpecGym.

Conclusion: The framework enables dynamic adaptation to novel spectra and generates structurally accurate molecular candidates even when predictions deviate from ground truth, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [161] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current pathology foundation models have fundamental weaknesses including low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, and safety vulnerabilities due to conceptual mismatches between generic AI assumptions and tissue complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why foundation models that revolutionized other domains are failing in computational pathology despite high expectations for cancer diagnosis and prognostication.

Method: Systematic evaluation of pathology foundation models to identify root causes of their shortcomings through conceptual analysis of the mismatch between AI modeling assumptions and tissue biology.

Result: Identified seven key causes: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and fundamental design flaws related to tissue patch size.

Conclusion: Current pathology foundation models are conceptually misaligned with tissue morphology and require fundamental paradigm rethinking rather than incremental improvements.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

### [162] [ReCAP: Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23822)
*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCAP is a hierarchical framework that improves LLM performance on long-horizon tasks through recursive context-aware reasoning and planning, achieving significant gains in subgoal alignment and success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequential prompting methods suffer from context drift, goal information loss, and recurrent failure cycles, while hierarchical methods weaken cross-level continuity or incur high runtime overhead.

Method: ReCAP combines three mechanisms: plan-ahead decomposition (generate full subtask list, execute first item, refine remainder), structured re-injection of parent plans, and memory-efficient execution with bounded active prompts.

Result: ReCAP achieved 32% gain on synchronous Robotouille and 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under strict pass@1 protocol, substantially improving subgoal alignment and success rates.

Conclusion: The framework effectively aligns high-level goals with low-level actions, reduces redundant prompting, and preserves coherent context updates across recursion for long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper studies decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently rank goals using environmental data, then exchange rankings and use fixed conflict-resolution rules. LLM-based agents with proper prompts achieve near-optimal performance and outperform traditional heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under decentralized conditions, particularly focusing on goal assignment in multi-agent path planning without negotiation or iterative coordination.

Method: Agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals using structured environment representations (grid visualizations and scenario data), then exchange rankings and apply fixed deterministic conflict-resolution rules. Systematic comparison of greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and LLM-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings.

Result: LLM-based agents with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: Language models show strong potential for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning, with information structure playing a crucial role in system performance.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises struggle to move AI agents from prototypes to production systems delivering business value due to fragmented frameworks, slow development, and lack of standardized evaluation practices.

Method: CUGA uses hierarchical planner-executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, evaluated on AppWorld, WebArena benchmarks and BPO-TA enterprise benchmark with 26 tasks across 13 analytics endpoints.

Result: CUGA achieved state-of-the-art performance on academic benchmarks and approached specialized agent accuracy in enterprise pilot while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost.

Conclusion: Generalist agents like CUGA show early evidence of operating at enterprise scale, with lessons learned for advancing research architectures into robust enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel training algorithm for Large Vision-Language Models that reformulates reasoning as posterior inference using amortized variational inference, introducing diversity-seeking reinforcement learning with sparse rewards to generate diverse, high-quality reasoning chains while avoiding reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training methods like SFT, PPO, and GRPO for chain-of-thought reasoning in LVLMs suffer from poor generalization across unseen reasoning tasks and heavy reliance on biased reward models, limiting their interpretability and reliability.

Method: The authors reformulate reasoning as posterior inference and develop a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. They use diversity-seeking reinforcement learning with a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals, and implement Bayesian inference-scaling with marginal likelihood to efficiently rank rationales and answers.

Result: The proposed method empirically enhances state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, showing improvements in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The variational inference-based training algorithm with diversity-seeking reinforcement learning and Bayesian scaling effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, providing better generalization, interpretability, and performance across diverse reasoning tasks in LVLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

### [169] [Decentralized Causal Discovery using Judo Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23942)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A decentralized framework for causal discovery using judo calculus that handles context-dependent causal effects across different regimes through local truth in sheaf theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world causal effects vary by context (age, country, dose, etc.), requiring methods that can handle this regime dependence rather than assuming universal causal relationships.

Method: Uses judo calculus (j-stable causal inference with j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves) combined with standard causal discovery methods (score-based, constraint-based, gradient-based) to formalize context dependence through local truth.

Result: Experimental results show computational efficiency gains from the decentralized sheaf-theoretic approach and improved performance over classical causal discovery methods across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The judo calculus framework provides an effective approach for handling context-dependent causal relationships through local truth, offering both computational advantages and better performance than traditional methods.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal
discovery methods.

### [170] [The Sign Estimator: LLM Alignment in the Face of Choice Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23965)
*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new LLM alignment method called the sign estimator that addresses heterogeneity in human preferences by replacing cross-entropy with binary classification loss, providing consistent ordinal alignment with improved accuracy over standard RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human preferences and yield inconsistent estimates of population-average utility when using naive probabilistic models on pairwise comparison data.

Method: The sign estimator replaces cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step, providing a simple, provably consistent, and efficient estimator for LLM alignment under mild assumptions.

Result: In simulations using digital twins, the sign estimator reduces preference distortion by nearly 35% in angular estimation error and decreases disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF, while outperforming panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The sign estimator offers a simple yet effective solution for consistent ordinal alignment in LLMs, achieving polynomial finite-sample error bounds and maintaining implementation simplicity while substantially improving preference estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a conditioned deep learning model that incorporates individuals' social infrastructure resilience (SIR) and spatial context to predict post-event movement pattern shifts using sparse individual-level data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to predict individual movement pattern shifts after disruptive events due to: 1) lack of measures for heterogeneous social infrastructure resilience (SIR), 2) insufficient capture of complex interactions between movement patterns and spatial contexts, and 3) spatial sparsity of individual-level movement data that doesn't suit traditional prediction methods.

Method: The study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model to capture complex relationships between individual movement patterns and local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context enhances the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement patterns. The conditioned model captures divergent shifts in movement patterns among individuals with similar pre-event patterns but different SIR.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses key challenges in predicting movement pattern shifts by integrating SIR measures and spatial context through deep learning, enabling better prediction of heterogeneous responses to disruptive events.

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

*Tingyue Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Shilong Zhang,Zhiding Liu,Xiaoyu Tao,Yucong Luo,Jintao Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast is a cross-domain time series forecasting framework that decomposes series into seasonal and trend components, using specialized generative pathways for each component to handle domain-specific variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-domain forecasting methods struggle with domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns because they treat time series as undifferentiated sequences without explicitly decoupling structural components.

Method: OneCast decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components. Seasonal patterns are captured via lightweight projection with interpretable basis functions, while trends are encoded into discrete tokens and inferred through masked discrete diffusion.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight domains show that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-domain time series forecasting.

Conclusion: The structured decomposition approach with tailored generative pathways for seasonal and trend components enables effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMLogAnalyzer is a clustering-based log analysis chatbot that combines LLMs and ML algorithms to simplify cybersecurity log analysis, overcoming LLM limitations and achieving 39-68% performance improvements over state-of-the-art chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System log analysis is crucial for cybersecurity but challenging due to high costs, lack of expertise, and time constraints. Traditional approaches struggle with vast, diverse log data, making basic analysis difficult for many organizations.

Method: Uses a modular architecture with router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. Combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Machine Learning algorithms to address LLM limitations like context window constraints and poor structured text handling.

Result: Achieved 39-68% performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based chatbots (ChatGPT, ChatPDF, NotebookLM) across four domain logs and various tasks. Showed strong robustness with 93% reduction in interquartile range using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability.

Conclusion: LLMLogAnalyzer effectively enhances LLM capabilities for structured text analysis, improving accuracy and robustness in log analysis tasks. The framework is valuable for both cybersecurity experts and non-technical users, streamlining log analysis processes.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

*Md. Shihab Uddin,Md Nazmus Shakib,Rahul Bhadani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This study compares classical physics-based car following models (IDM, OVM, OVRV, CACC) with a machine learning approach (Random Forest) for electric vehicle behavior prediction, finding that Random Forest significantly outperforms classical models across all driving gap scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing electric vehicle adoption, understanding EV driving behavior is crucial for traffic safety and smart driving systems development, especially in mixed autonomy environments with both EVs and traditional vehicles.

Method: Used real-world EV following data to calibrate classical models by minimizing RMSE, and trained Random Forest Regressor using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs to predict acceleration.

Result: Random Forest achieved superior accuracy with RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap), 0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap), while the best classical model (CACC) had RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps.

Conclusion: Machine learning models like Random Forest demonstrate significantly better performance than physics-based models for EV car following behavior prediction, making them valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed traffic dynamics.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

*Sandeep Vissapragada,Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Vandita Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HistoLens is a transparent AI system for pathology that allows doctors to ask questions in plain English about tissue slides and provides clear reports with visual proofs (heatmaps) showing exactly which cells the AI analyzed, while ignoring background noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build trust in AI for medical diagnosis by creating a transparent system that explains its reasoning, similar to consulting a colleague, rather than being a black box.

Method: Created HistoLens which translates natural language questions into precise AI queries, provides structured reports, and generates visual heatmaps showing the exact cells and regions used for analysis. The system is trained to focus only on patient tissue while ignoring background noise.

Result: A workflow where pathologists remain in charge as experts, using the trustworthy AI assistant to verify insights and make faster, more confident diagnoses.

Conclusion: HistoLens successfully creates a collaborative partnership between doctors and AI by providing transparency and explainability, enabling pathologists to trust and effectively use AI assistance while maintaining their expert role in diagnosis.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual incident management is labor-intensive and error-prone with massive observability data, while existing automated approaches struggle with generalization, interpretability, and high deployment costs.

Method: Uses training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, multi-agent collaboration framework for transparent diagnostic inference, and dual self-evolution mechanism combining internal model updates with external experience accumulation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving.

Conclusion: OpsAgent is a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems, addressing key limitations of existing incident management approaches.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

### [177] [BMGQ: A Bottom-up Method for Generating Complex Multi-hop Reasoning Questions from Semi-structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24151)
*Bingsen Qiu,Zijian Liu,Xiao Liu,Haoshen Yang,Zeren Gao,Bingjie Wang,Feier Zhang,Yixuan Qin,Chunyan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated framework for generating high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop question answering datasets from semi-structured knowledge sources, addressing the scarcity of suitable data for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-hop QA datasets are scarce and mostly designed for evaluation rather than training, while manual curation of non-trivially retrievable questions is prohibitively expensive and doesn't scale, creating a critical data bottleneck for training retrieval-and-reasoning agents.

Method: The system uses: (i) NLI-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion to grow evidence clusters; (ii) reverse question construction to compose oblique cues; and (iii) a two-step quality evaluation pipeline with multi-model consensus filtering and structured constraint decomposition.

Result: The framework produces complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for both SFT/RL training and challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while maintaining difficulty comparable to strong evaluation benchmarks.

Conclusion: This automated approach effectively addresses the data bottleneck in multi-hop QA by generating training-ready datasets that preserve the challenging characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLM$_1$ is a multimodal spatial foundation model that bridges digital and physical spaces, enabling cross-embodiment control and outperforming existing models in both digital and physical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models have limitations: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces, VLAs lack robust high-level reasoning, and ELLMs are constrained to digital space with poor physical generalization. Unified models that operate seamlessly across spaces and embodiments are needed.

Method: Two-stage training: Stage I injects embodied knowledge into MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module via intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from MLLM to guide control without fine-tuning the backbone. Supported by self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six tasks.

Result: BLM$_1$ outperforms four model families (MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, GMLMs) achieving ~6% gains in digital tasks and ~3% gains in physical tasks across digital and physical benchmarks.

Conclusion: BLM$_1$ successfully integrates cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization, demonstrating robust performance across digital and physical environments with a single model instance.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

*Xin Yang,Yuhang Zhang,Wei Li,Xin Lin,Wenbin Zou,Chen Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniPlanner is the first multi-dataset planning framework for autonomous vehicles that achieves unified cross-dataset learning through three innovations: History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network, Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper, and Sparse-to-Dense paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning planning methods are confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in planning. The discovery that vehicular trajectory distributions and history-future correlations are consistent across datasets motivates multi-dataset integration.

Method: Three synergistic innovations: 1) HFTDN aggregates trajectory pairs from multiple datasets using historical similarity to retrieve relevant futures; 2) GFTM learns robust history-future correlations with gradient-free design to prevent shortcut learning; 3) S2D paradigm uses adaptive dropout during training and full prior utilization during inference.

Result: The framework enables unified cross-dataset learning and generates cross-dataset planning guidance while ensuring planning knowledge is safely transferable.

Conclusion: UniPlanner successfully addresses the limitations of single-dataset training by leveraging consistent trajectory patterns across datasets, providing a robust multi-dataset planning framework for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

*Weihua Cheng,Ersheng Ni,Wenlong Wang,Yifei Sun,Junming Liu,Wangyu Shen,Yirong Chen,Botian Shi,Ding Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MGA is a GUI agent that uses an "observe first, then decide" approach with structured memory to improve robustness and generalization in desktop and web interface interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents suffer from error propagation due to dependence on historical trajectories and local exploration bias from "decision-first, observation-later" mechanisms that overlook critical interface cues.

Method: MGA models each step as an independent context-rich environment state using a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and dynamically updated structured memory, following an "observe first, then decide" principle.

Result: Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer show MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The Memory-Driven GUI Agent successfully reframes GUI interaction around observation-first principles and demonstrates superior performance across various real-world applications and benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: Current LLMs struggle to effectively use the rapidly growing MCP ecosystem due to limited server coverage, manual curation requirements, and lack of training support, hindering real-world deployment.

Method: An automated web-agent-driven pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training that collects and filters data from thousands of servers and tools to create instruction-function call pairs and trajectories.

Conclusion: MCP-Flow provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP environments by automating large-scale data collection and training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform

### [182] [Investigating Intra-Abstraction Policies For Non-exact Abstraction Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24297)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses a weakness in Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) where state/action abstractions can cause multiple actions from the same parent to have identical UCB values, requiring tie-breaking. The authors propose and evaluate alternative intra-abstraction policies that outperform random tie-breaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS has sample efficiency issues that can be improved using abstractions, but current approaches like pruned OGA don't properly handle cases where multiple actions from the same parent fall into the same abstract node, leading to identical UCB values that require tie-breaking.

Method: The authors propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intra-abstraction policies to replace the implicit random tie-breaking used in state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms like pruned OGA.

Result: Several of the proposed intra-abstraction policies outperform the random tie-breaking policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Alternative intra-abstraction policies can significantly improve MCTS performance when dealing with abstract nodes containing multiple actions from the same parent, addressing a previously unnoticed issue in existing abstraction algorithms.

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

### [183] [Verifying Large Language Models' Reasoning Paths via Correlation Matrix Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24299)
*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Self-Indicator, a method that uses the correlation matrix rank between input problems and output reasoning paths as an indicator of reasoning correctness in LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to errors and hallucinations, but existing checking methods rely heavily on external resources like trained verifiers or elaborate prompts, leading to high computational overhead and domain-specific limitations.

Method: The method uses the rank of the correlation matrix between input problems and output reasoning paths as a correctness indicator. It's a plug-and-approach that reweights candidate reasoning paths without requiring external models or complex prompts.

Result: Self-Indicator achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones and improves accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%. It works across multiple LLMs of varying scales and model families.

Conclusion: The internal behaviors of LLMs already contain indicators of reasoning credibility, and the correlation matrix rank is a robust, computationally efficient method for verifying LLM outputs without external dependencies.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

*Deniz Gorur,Antoni Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent framework for claim verification using LLMs, where different agents generate evidence for and against claims through quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), showing improved forecasting accuracy with multiple agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance judgmental forecasting by treating it as claim verification and leveraging multiple LLM agents to provide diverse evidence and perspectives for assessing event plausibility.

Method: A multi-agent framework with three types of LLM agents: ArgLLM for generating/evaluating QBAFs, RbAM for relation-based argument mining from external sources, and RAG-ArgLLM combining retrieval-augmented generation with argument mining.

Result: Experiments on judgmental forecasting datasets showed that combining evidence from multiple agents (especially three agents) improves forecasting accuracy while providing explainable evidence combinations.

Conclusion: Multi-agent frameworks with LLMs can effectively support claim verification for judgmental forecasting by combining diverse evidence sources and improving accuracy through collaborative argumentation.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

TL;DR: This paper provides a comprehensive guide for using generative Large Language Models (gLLMs) like ChatGPT in quantitative content analysis for communication research, addressing seven critical challenges to ensure quality standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: gLLMs show great potential for content analysis by outperforming human coders in speed and cost, but their integration into communication research methodology remains underdeveloped with quality challenges.

Method: The paper synthesizes emerging research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a best-practice guide addressing seven critical challenges: codebook development, prompt engineering, model selection, parameter tuning, iterative refinement, validation, and performance enhancement.

Result: The research demonstrates that gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders on various coding tasks, decode implicit meanings, and be deployed with basic programming skills while requiring minimal annotated data.

Conclusion: The paper aims to make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to communication researchers while ensuring adherence to disciplinary quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research ethics.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

Method: Multi-agent system implementing modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation, incorporating perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation guided by PCS principles.

Result: VDSAgents consistently outperformed AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter across nine diverse datasets using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o backends.

Conclusion: Embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation is feasible and improves performance over existing end-to-end systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

### [187] [A Unified Geometric Space Bridging AI Models and the Human Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24342)
*Silin Chen,Yuzhong Chen,Zifan Wang,Junhao Wang,Zifeng Jia,Keith M Kendrick,Tuo Zhang,Lin Zhao,Dezhong Yao,Tianming Liu,Xi Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Brain-like Space, a unified geometric framework for comparing AI models' intrinsic organization with human brain networks, revealing that brain-likeness depends on pretraining paradigms and positional encoding rather than just modality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI systems organize information similarly to the human brain, and to create a common ground for comparing different AI models (vision, language, multimodal) beyond specific inputs and tasks.

Method: Mapping AI models' intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks, analyzing 151 Transformer-based models including large vision, language, and multimodal models.

Result: Discovered a continuous arc-shaped geometry in Brain-like Space showing gradual increase in brain-likeness; brain-likeness is shaped by pretraining paradigm (global semantic abstraction emphasis) and positional encoding (cross-modal fusion facilitation), not identical to downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for quantifying and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing deep organizational principles bridging machines and the brain.

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

*Pedram Fard,Alaleh Azhir,Neguine Rezaii,Jiazi Tian,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI ecosystem for personalized N-of-1 medical decision support that moves beyond average-patient models to provide transparent, equitable care for individual patients, especially those with rare conditions or underrepresented demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in medicine focus on average patients and fail at margins - patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This 'average patient fallacy' erodes equity and trust in medical AI.

Method: Multi-agent ecosystem clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities that use shared model libraries and evidence synthesis tools. Results converge in a coordination layer weighing reliability, uncertainty, and data density to create decision-support packets with risk estimates, confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence.

Result: Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk-coverage trade-offs. The system provides transparent decision support tailored to individual patients.

Conclusion: By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach aligns medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual, addressing challenges like computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit through caching, consensus checks, and adaptive trials.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

TL;DR: Policy Cards are a machine-readable standard for defining operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents at deployment, enabling runtime compliance and verifiable assurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-level AI governance frameworks and practical implementation by providing a standardized way to encode constraints that agents must follow during operation.

Method: Develop Policy Cards as a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations, evidentiary requirements, and mappings to assurance frameworks like NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and EU AI Act.

Result: Policy Cards can be automatically validated, version-controlled, and linked to runtime enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines, enabling verifiable compliance for autonomous agents.

Conclusion: Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism for integrating governance with engineering practice, enabling accountable autonomy at scale and forming a foundation for distributed assurance in multi-agent ecosystems.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

### [190] [Improving LLM Reasoning via Dependency-Aware Query Decomposition and Logic-Parallel Content Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24390)
*Xianjun Gao,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion is a novel LLM reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and parallel content expansion to overcome the efficiency-quality trade-off in real-time web applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning struggles to balance high-quality complex reasoning with low-latency requirements for interactive web services, creating a bottleneck due to inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies.

Method: Orion decomposes queries into two phases: key point generation (using retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting) and content parallel expansion (concurrently elaborating points based on dependency graphs), with pipeline scheduling across multiple queries.

Result: Orion achieves up to 4.33x higher token generation speed, 3.42x lower answer latency, and improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the dual requirements of efficiency and quality in LLM reasoning for real-time web applications through dependency-aware decomposition and parallel processing.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

*Jiarui Qin,Yunjia Xi,Junjie Huang,Renting Rui,Di Yin,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APTBench is a new benchmark framework that converts real-world agent tasks into multiple-choice/text completion questions to evaluate agentic capabilities during LLM pre-training, focusing on planning and action abilities in software engineering and deep research scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pre-training benchmarks focus on isolated static skills and fail to evaluate agentic capabilities, while agent benchmarks require multi-turn abilities that base models lack. There's a need for benchmarks that can assess agentic potential during pre-training to guide model development more effectively.

Method: APTBench converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models, focusing on core agentic abilities like planning and action across key scenarios including software engineering and deep research.

Result: APTBench provides more predictive signals of downstream agent performance compared to general-purpose benchmarks, while being significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.

Conclusion: APTBench addresses the gap in evaluating agentic capabilities during pre-training by providing a framework that can effectively assess and guide the development of LLMs' autonomous task execution potential in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Model (VLM) powered mobile agents show promise for digital automation but pose significant safety risks including system compromise and privacy leakage, yet detecting these risks in complex mobile environments remains underexplored.

Method: Introduced MobileRisk-Live as a dynamic sandbox environment with safety detection benchmark, and proposed OS-Sentinel - a hybrid framework combining Formal Verifier for system-level violations and VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions.

Result: OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics in safety detection performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides critical insights for developing safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents, establishing a foundation for mobile agent safety research.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Method: Introduces Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement.

Result: Experiments comparing simulated crime rates with real-world data show LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights aligning with real-world observations. Micro-level simulations reveal that well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal systems better protect vulnerable individuals' rights.

Conclusion: LLM-based legal society simulation is feasible and can provide valuable insights for legal theory development and administration, particularly showing the importance of transparent and adaptive legal systems for protecting vulnerable populations.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world

TL;DR: A pattern language for constructing actionable world models from structured data like DOM and web service descriptions, addressing verbosity and static API limitations through DOM transduction and hypermedia affordances recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software agents need actionable world models from structured data, but face challenges with verbose HTML being computationally intractable and static API integrations preventing adaptation to evolving services.

Method: Two complementary architectural patterns: DOM Transduction Pattern distills verbose DOM into compact task-relevant representations, and Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables dynamic discovery and integration of unknown web services at runtime.

Result: Provides a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain accurate world models from structured data.

Conclusion: The patterns enable scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources by allowing agents to efficiently build and update their internal world models.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for neuromorphic robotic control by analyzing surrogate gradient slopes and proposing a novel training approach using privileged guiding policies, achieving significant performance improvements in real-world drone control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neuromorphic computing offers energy efficiency for robotics, but SNNs face challenges in complex control tasks due to non-differentiable spiking neurons requiring surrogate gradients and stateful dynamics requiring sequence training, which is hindered by limited sequence lengths in reinforcement learning.

Method: Systematic analysis of surrogate gradient slope settings, showing shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude but reduce alignment with true gradients. Proposed novel training approach using privileged guiding policy to bootstrap learning while exploiting online environment interactions with spiking policy.

Result: In RL settings, shallower slopes or scheduled slopes led to 2.1x improvement in training and final deployed performance. Combined with adaptive slope schedule for drone position control, achieved average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques like Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC (which achieved at most -200 points).

Conclusion: This work advances both theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers, demonstrating successful application in real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
systems.

TL;DR: A cost-efficient pipeline for in-context learning that reduces LLM dependency by using cross-task examples for pseudo-labeling and graph-based label propagation to create demonstrations without additional LLM queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality examples for new or challenging tasks is costly and labor-intensive, creating a need for more efficient methods to generate in-context learning demonstrations.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use cross-task examples to prompt LLM for pseudo-labeling small target dataset, 2) Apply graph-based label propagation to spread labels to remaining examples without LLM queries, creating fully pseudo-labeled dataset for ICL demonstrations.

Result: Experiments across five tasks show strong performance while significantly reducing labeling costs compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully combines cross-task supervision flexibility with LLM-free propagation scalability, providing an effective solution for cost-efficient in-context learning demonstration generation.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

Motivation: GenAI promises transformative opportunities in healthcare but requires understanding what can and cannot be achieved. Current deployments need better integration with healthcare tasks and data management.

Method: Repositioning the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems, with semantic vector search, contextual querying, and effective data processing pipelines to support both upstream model training and downstream clinical applications.

Result: The proposed ecosystem enables sustainable integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge, supporting foundation models with high-quality multimodal data for pretraining and fine-tuning, while serving as a knowledge retrieval backend for task-specific inference.

Conclusion: A data-centric approach with the medical data ecosystem as the foundation enables effective deployment of GenAI for high-quality healthcare delivery, reducing cognitive burden on clinicians and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FunReason-MT is a novel data synthesis framework that generates high-quality multi-turn function calling training data for LLMs, addressing limitations of existing methods through environment-API graph interactions, advanced tool-query synthesis, and guided iterative chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data synthesis methods for function calling training are insufficient for real-world environments due to challenges in targeted model training, tool architecture isolation, and multi-turn logical dependencies. High-quality multi-turn training data is critical for developing advanced AI systems' tool-using capabilities.

Method: The framework employs three key components: 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to collect diverse high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify complex query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated Chain-of-Thought generation.

Result: A 4B model trained on FunReason-MT generated data achieved state-of-the-art performance on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3), outperforming most comparable-sized models and even closed-source models. Further improvements on BFCLv4 confirmed the framework's reliability.

Conclusion: FunReason-MT provides a robust and reliable source for agentic learning, effectively addressing the structural deficiencies in multi-turn function calling data synthesis and enabling superior performance in real-world tool-use scenarios.

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This review analyzes foundation models (FMs) for site-specific disease management in crops, covering large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and their integration with adaptive learning, reinforcement learning, and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to advance site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops through machine and deep learning, particularly leveraging foundation models that can integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators.

Method: The review screened approximately 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on LLMs and VLMs, and discussing their role in adaptive learning, reinforcement learning, and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying.

Result: Key findings include: FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; VLMs outpace LLMs with 5-10x increase in publications; RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying; addressing sim-to-real gap is critical; human-robot collaboration remains limited; multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

Conclusion: Foundation models are transforming crop disease management by enabling integrated visual-textual analysis and supporting advanced frameworks like digital twins and reinforcement learning, though challenges like sim-to-real gaps and limited human-robot collaboration need addressing for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling,
yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool
interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that
models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

*Shengjie Liu,Li Dong,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that integrates tool and document knowledge graphs to improve exemplar artifact generation by modeling dependencies between tools and procedural knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance exemplar artifact generation by uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools and documents, addressing the need for better modeling of tool interactions and procedural knowledge integration.

Method: Constructs tool knowledge graph from tool schemas using DeepResearch-inspired analysis, creates complementary knowledge graph from internal documents/SOPs, fuses both graphs, and employs deep-sparse integration strategy to align structural tool dependencies with procedural knowledge for plan generation.

Result: Experiments show the unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan generation, demonstrating successful integration of tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: Linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs provides significant benefits for tool-augmented reasoning and planning, enabling more effective exemplar artifact generation through dependency modeling.

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.
