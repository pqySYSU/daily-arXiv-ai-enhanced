### [1] [WildCap: Facial Appearance Capture in the Wild via Hybrid Inverse Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11237)
*Yuxuan Han,Xin Ming,Tianxiao Li,Zhuofan Shen,Qixuan Zhang,Lan Xu,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildCap enables high-quality facial appearance capture from smartphone videos in uncontrolled lighting by combining data-driven image conversion with model-based inverse rendering and a novel texel grid lighting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing facial appearance capture methods require controllable lighting, which increases cost and limits usability. There's a need for methods that work with in-the-wild smartphone videos.

Method: Proposes a hybrid inverse rendering framework: 1) SwitchLight data-driven method converts captured images to constrained conditions, 2) model-based inverse rendering, 3) texel grid lighting model to handle non-physical artifacts, 4) joint optimization with diffusion prior for reflectance maps.

Result: Achieves significantly better results than prior methods in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin.

Conclusion: WildCap enables high-quality facial appearance capture from ordinary smartphone videos, making professional-quality facial capture more accessible and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.

*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and categorizes them into Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report categories, achieving 94.62% text recognition rate on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical challenges in text image classification including changing lighting conditions, random orientation, curvature, partial text coverage, low resolution, and barely visible text in real-world scenarios.

Method: Four-step processing pipeline: 1) Image acquisition and preprocessing, 2) Text detection using DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus), 3) Text classification using BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers), 4) Results presentation via Python/PyQt5 UI. Supports gallery mode (browsing files) and live mode (camera feeds).

Result: Achieved 94.62% text recognition rate when tested for 10 hours on the Total-Text dataset, which includes high-resolution images representing various problematic conditions. The system effectively handles mixed-source text categorization in uncontrolled imaging environments.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology demonstrates practical effectiveness for text image classification across diverse document types (Invoice, Form, Letter, Report) even under challenging real-world imaging conditions, with a robust workflow connecting all processing stages.

Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.

*Ruining Li,Yuxin Yao,Chuanxia Zheng,Christian Rupprecht,Joan Lasenby,Shangzhe Wu,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Particulate is a feed-forward transformer network that directly infers articulated structure from a single static 3D mesh, predicting parts, kinematics, and motion constraints in seconds without per-object optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches for extracting articulated 3D models require time-consuming per-object optimization. There's a need for fast, feed-forward methods that can infer complete articulated structure from static meshes, including for AI-generated 3D assets.

Method: Uses a transformer network (Part Articulation Transformer) that processes input mesh point clouds to predict 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints with native multi-joint support. Trained end-to-end on diverse articulated 3D datasets, then lifts predictions to the input mesh during inference.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, generates fully articulated 3D models in seconds (vs. optimization-based methods), works with AI-generated 3D assets, and enables articulated object extraction from single images when combined with image-to-3D generators.

Conclusion: Particulate provides a fast, effective feed-forward solution for articulated structure inference that advances the field, enables new applications with AI-generated content, and introduces improved evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

### [4] [Moment-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting: Resolving Volumetric Occlusion with Order-Independent Transmittance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11800)
*Jan U. Müller,Robin Tim Landsgesell,Leif Van Holland,Patrick Stotko,Reinhard Klein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Extends 3D Gaussian Splatting with moment-based transmittance computation for accurate rendering of semi-transparent objects without ray tracing or per-pixel sorting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting has limitations in rendering complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects due to simplified alpha blending and coarse density approximations in its rasterizer.

Method: Uses moment-based order-independent transparency to characterize density distribution along camera rays with statistical moments. Computes per-pixel moments from contributing 3D Gaussians, reconstructs continuous transmittance functions, and samples within each Gaussian.

Result: Bridges gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving reconstruction and rendering quality.

Conclusion: Enables high-fidelity transmittance computation for 3D Gaussian representations without ray tracing or per-pixel sorting, enhancing rendering of semi-transparent objects.

Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.

*Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents text-guided approaches to improve fairness in facial gender classification by leveraging semantic information from image captions during training, using Image Text Matching guidance and Image Text fusion to reduce demographic bias without requiring demographic labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address demographic bias and fairness issues in facial gender classification algorithms, particularly the challenge of achieving equitable performance across different gender and racial groups in AI systems.

Method: The core methodology uses semantic information from image captions during training. Two main strategies: 1) Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance - trains models to discern fine-grained alignments between images and texts for enhanced multimodal representations; 2) Image Text fusion - combines both modalities into comprehensive representations. The technique operates without demographic labels and is application-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender and racial groups compared to existing methods. The methods show improved fairness without requiring demographic annotations.

Conclusion: The research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms by leveraging textual guidance. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing demographic bias in gender classification and present an interpretable, intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems.

Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.

The data, code, and model will be publicly available.

*Marshal Ashif Shawkat,Moidul Hasan,Taufiq Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a knowledge distillation method using teacher-student CNN framework to reduce spurious correlations in TB classification from chest X-rays without requiring bounding-box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TB remains a major global health issue, especially in resource-limited areas. While chest X-rays are accessible diagnostic tools, they require expert interpretation that's often unavailable. Existing machine learning models for TB classification suffer from spurious correlations and poor generalization, and creating large annotated datasets with bounding boxes is expensive and logistically challenging.

Method: The study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models (using ResNet50 architecture) in a teacher-student framework. The method reduces spurious correlations and localizes TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. The approach was trained on the TBX11k dataset.

Result: The proposed method achieved an impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. The student model consistently outperformed the teacher model, demonstrating improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation provides an effective approach for training TB classification models that reduce spurious correlations and localize abnormalities without expensive bounding-box annotations, offering improved robustness and potential for clinical deployment in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

*Chenjun Li,Cheng Wan,Laurin Lux,Alexander Berger,Richard B. Rosen,Martin J. Menten,Johannes C. Paetzold*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR) framework generates synthetic OCTA images with DR pathologies and corresponding reasoning texts, creating OCTA-100K-SVR dataset to train VLMs for interpretable medical diagnosis without requiring large-scale real image-text data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Vision-Language Models for detailed medical reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets, but specialized domains like OCTA imaging lack precise text descriptions with grounded pathology explanations.

Method: Introduces SVR framework that controllably synthesizes realistic retinal vasculature images with DR features (capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, tortuosity) and automatically generates granular reasoning texts, creating OCTA-100K-SVR dataset with 100,000 image-text pairs.

Result: A general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on OCTA-100K-SVR achieves 89.67% zero-shot balanced classification accuracy on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines, and significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization through human expert evaluation.

Conclusion: SVR framework successfully addresses data scarcity in specialized medical domains by generating synthetic training data, enabling VLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on real clinical data while providing interpretable reasoning and pathology localization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.

*Felix O'Mahony,Roberto Cipolla,Ayush Tewari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VDAWorld is a new world modeling framework that uses a Vision-Language Model as an intelligent agent to distill image-caption pairs into tractable abstract representations, then selects appropriate physics simulators to generate high-quality dynamic simulations across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative video models have fundamental limitations: they violate physical/logical rules, lack interactivity, and operate as opaque black boxes unsuitable for building structured, queryable worlds. There's a need for a new paradigm that overcomes these challenges.

Method: VDAWorld uses a Vision-Language Model as an intelligent agent to orchestrate the process. The VLM autonomously constructs grounded (2D/3D) scene representations by selecting from vision tools, then chooses compatible physics simulators (rigid body, fluid, etc.) to act upon the representation. The framework can infer latent dynamics from static scenes to predict plausible future states.

Result: The combination of intelligent abstraction and adaptive simulation results in a versatile world model capable of producing high-quality simulations across a wide range of dynamic scenarios.

Conclusion: VDAWorld represents a new paradigm for world modeling that addresses the limitations of generative video models by creating tractable, abstract representations optimized for simulation through intelligent vision-language orchestration and adaptive physics simulation.

Abstract: Generative video models, a leading approach to world modeling, face fundamental limitations. They often violate physical and logical rules, lack interactivity, and operate as opaque black boxes ill-suited for building structured, queryable worlds. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new paradigm focused on distilling an image caption pair into a tractable, abstract representation optimized for simulation. We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it. VDAWorld can then infer latent dynamics from the static scene to predict plausible future states. Our experiments show that this combination of intelligent abstraction and adaptive simulation results in a versatile world model capable of producing high quality simulations across a wide range of dynamic scenarios.

*Jack Brady,Andrew Dailey,Kristen Schang,Zo Vic Shong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper surveys the evolution of urban dynamics monitoring, focusing on event-based cameras as a promising technology for studying city dynamics while addressing privacy concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional urban monitoring methods have limitations, and there's a need for better practices to understand city dynamics. Event-based cameras offer unique capabilities that could address these challenges while maintaining privacy.

Method: The paper conducts a survey analyzing event-based cameras, their applications, advantages, challenges, and machine learning applications. It proposes multi-sensor fusion combining event-based cameras with other sensors like infrared, LiDAR, or vibration sensors.

Result: Event-based cameras are identified as a promising medium for capturing urban dynamics information due to their ability to work in low-light conditions and maintain privacy. Multi-sensor fusion approaches show potential to enhance event-based camera capabilities and overcome their limitations.

Conclusion: Event-based cameras represent an evolutionary step in urban monitoring technology, offering privacy-preserving capabilities for studying city dynamics, with multi-sensor fusion approaches providing enhanced potential for overcoming current limitations.

Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.

### [11] [Vision-Language Models for Infrared Industrial Sensing in Additive Manufacturing Scene Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11098)
*Nazanin Mahjourian,Vinh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-IRIS adapts vision-language models for zero-shot infrared industrial sensing by converting thermal images to RGB-compatible magma representations, enabling workpiece detection without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturing environments often have low-light conditions where conventional vision systems fail. Infrared cameras work well in these conditions but require labeled datasets for AI systems. Zero-shot learning with vision-language models offers a solution, but current VLMs can't understand infrared data since they're trained on RGB images.

Method: VLM-IRIS preprocesses infrared images from FLIR Boson sensors into RGB-compatible inputs using magma representation. It applies centroid prompt ensembling with CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder for zero-shot predictions without model retraining.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed, leveraging temperature differences between build plate and workpieces that are visible in thermal imaging.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring in industrial settings, enabling infrared camera integration with existing vision-language models.

Abstract: Many manufacturing environments operate in low-light conditions or within enclosed machines where conventional vision systems struggle. Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.

### [12] [VGent: Visual Grounding via Modular Design for Disentangling Reasoning and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11099)
*Weitai Kang,Jason Kuen,Mengwei Ren,Zijun Wei,Yan Yan,Kangning Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGent is a modular visual grounding system that separates reasoning from box prediction using a frozen MLLM encoder and detector-based decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual grounding models have limitations: MLLM-based auto-regressive decoding is slow and hallucination-prone, while re-alignment approaches compromise LLM's pretrained reasoning capabilities. There's a need for a system that preserves reasoning power while enabling efficient, accurate grounding.

Method: VGent uses a modular encoder-decoder architecture: (1) frozen MLLM encoder for untouched reasoning, (2) decoder that takes detector-proposed boxes as queries and selects targets via cross-attention on encoder states. Includes QuadThinker (RL-based multi-target reasoning enhancement), mask-aware labeling for detection-segmentation ambiguity, and global target recognition for improved proposal selection.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods. Boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

Conclusion: VGent successfully disentangles reasoning from localization, leveraging advances in both object detection and MLLMs. The modular design enables independent upgrades and avoids pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, providing an efficient and accurate visual grounding solution.

Abstract: Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

### [13] [Information-driven Fusion of Pathology Foundation Models for Enhanced Disease Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11104)
*Brennan Flannery,Thomas DeSilvio,Jane Nguyen,Satish E. Viswanath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Intelligent correlation-guided fusion of multiple pathology foundation models improves cancer grading/staging performance across kidney, prostate, and rectal cancers by creating compact, interpretable representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While foundation models show strong performance in pathology tasks, there's limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, and biological interpretation of features. The study aims to develop an information-driven fusion strategy to integrate multiple pathology FMs for better cancer diagnosis.

Method: Used diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519), prostate (490), and rectal (200) cancers. Evaluated tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE). Compared three fusion schemes: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features using patient-stratified cross-validation.

Result: Intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings consistently outperformed best single FMs and naive fusion across all three cancers. Global similarity metrics showed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces but lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information. Attention maps revealed intelligent fusion concentrated on tumor regions while reducing focus on benign areas.

Conclusion: Correlation-guided intelligent fusion of pathology foundation models creates compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in computational pathology tasks for cancer grading and staging.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEGO is a three-stage framework that adapts pre-trained image restoration models to out-of-distribution domains using a generative oracle to create pseudo-ground-truth data for fine-tuning, without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to domain gaps, and traditional adaptation methods require complex architectural changes or paired data which is unavailable for unseen domains.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) Get initial restorations from pre-trained model, 2) Use frozen large-scale generative oracle to refine estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths, 3) Fine-tune original model using mixed-supervision combining in-distribution data with new pseudo-pairs.

Result: LEGO effectively bridges domain gaps, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks without sacrificing original robustness or requiring architectural modifications.

Conclusion: LEGO provides a practical solution for post-training domain adaptation of image restoration models to unseen real-world degradations by converting unsupervised challenges into tractable pseudo-supervised problems using generative oracles.

Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.

*Bowen Wen,Shaurya Dewan,Stan Birchfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast-FoundationStereo achieves real-time stereo matching with strong zero-shot generalization by compressing foundation models through knowledge distillation, neural architecture search, and structured pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo foundation models have strong zero-shot generalization but are too slow for real-time applications, while efficient stereo architectures sacrifice robustness and require per-domain fine-tuning.

Method: Three-part acceleration strategy: (1) knowledge distillation to compress hybrid backbone into efficient student, (2) blockwise neural architecture search for optimal cost filtering, (3) structured pruning for iterative refinement. Plus automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs.

Result: Model runs over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

Conclusion: Fast-FoundationStereo bridges the gap between foundation models' generalization and real-time efficiency, achieving strong zero-shot performance at real-time frame rates.

Abstract: Stereo foundation models achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

*Yiwei Lyu,Chenhui Zhao,Soumyanil Banerjee,Shixuan Liu,Akshay Rao,Akhil Kondepudi,Honglak Lee,Todd C. Hollon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ItemizedCLIP is a framework that learns visual representations from itemized text supervision (multiple independent text items per image), achieving better zero-shot performance and interpretability than standard CLIP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many visual domains like medical imaging and remote sensing have itemized text annotations where multiple text items describe distinct, semantically independent findings within a single image. Standard multi-caption supervision assumes redundant/overlapping captions, which doesn't fit these domains where items are independent and non-redundant.

Method: ItemizedCLIP uses a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and tailored objectives that enforce: 1) item independence (distinct regions for distinct items), and 2) representation completeness (coverage of all items).

Result: Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one synthetic dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines.

Conclusion: ItemizedCLIP produces semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable representations that effectively handle itemized text supervision common in specialized domains like medical imaging and remote sensing.

Abstract: Training vision models with language supervision enables general and transferable representations. However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image. Such supervision differs from standard multi-caption supervision, where captions are redundant or highly overlapping. Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines. The resulting ItemizedCLIP representations are semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/ItemizedCLIP.

*Anatole Jacquin de Margerie,Alexis Roger,Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reproduction study of Monkey VLM confirms tiling improves high-resolution image understanding but finds performance varies by task and tile granularity, with global context providing additional benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reproducibility issues in complex multimodal models by transparently reproducing and critically analyzing the Monkey VLM approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling.

Method: Replicated the Monkey VLM's image tiling strategy using open checkpoints and reimplemented the training pipeline, then extended the analysis by investigating the effect of including global context.

Result: Confirmed the original finding that tiling effectively recovers local details, but found deviations in results depending on task type and tile granularity. Global context inclusion provided practical insights for future modeling.

Conclusion: The reproduction validates the core tiling approach of Monkey VLM while revealing important nuances about task-specific performance variations and the value of global context, providing guidance for future high-resolution multimodal models.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.

### [18] [Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression via Video Codec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11186)
*Qi Yang,Geert Van Der Auwera,Zhu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGSCV is a lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting compression method using video codecs with two-stage Morton scanning and MiniPLAS optimization for efficient 2D map generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GS compression methods using PLAS are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting deployment on lightweight devices. There's a need for more efficient compression that maintains quality across bitrates.

Method: Proposes LGSCV with: 1) Two-stage Morton scan (3D then 2D) for blockwise 2D map generation compatible with video codecs, 2) PCA dimensionality reduction for spherical harmonics, 3) MiniPLAS for fast primitive permutation within blocks, and 4) optimized codec CU size configuration.

Result: Achieves over 20% RD gain vs state-of-the-art, reduces 2D map generation to ~1 second, cuts encoding time by 50%, and maintains quality across bitrates especially at medium-to-low ranges.

Conclusion: LGSCV provides an efficient, high-performance GS compression solution suitable for lightweight devices by combining Morton scanning, PCA optimization, and MiniPLAS permutation with video codec compatibility.

Abstract: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%. The code is available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/LGSCV .

*Tri Le,Khang Nguyen,Baoru Huang,Tung D. Ta,Anh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADKnitter is a compositional CAD generation framework that creates complementary CAD parts following both geometric constraints of existing models and semantic constraints of text prompts, using geometry-guided diffusion sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD modeling is time-consuming and requires expertise. While 3D generation has advanced, existing methods focus on single-part generation which doesn't suit real-world applications where multiple parts need assembly under semantic and geometric constraints.

Method: Proposes CADKnitter framework with geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. Also creates KnitCAD dataset with 310,000+ CAD models, textual prompts, and assembly metadata providing semantic and geometric constraints.

Result: Intensive experiments show CADKnitter outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin in generating complementary CAD parts that satisfy both geometric and semantic constraints.

Conclusion: CADKnitter enables compositional CAD generation that better addresses real-world applications by generating parts that follow both geometric constraints of existing models and semantic constraints of design requirements.

Abstract: Crafting computer-aided design (CAD) models has long been a painstaking and time-intensive task, demanding both precision and expertise from designers. With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints. Intensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin.

### [20] [AutoRefiner: Improving Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models via Reflective Refinement Over the Stochastic Sampling Path](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11203)
*Zhengyang Yu,Akio Hayakawa,Masato Ishii,Qingtao Yu,Takashi Shibuya,Jing Zhang,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoRefiner is a novel noise refinement method designed specifically for autoregressive video diffusion models to improve sample fidelity through efficient feedforward noise modulation without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion models show promise for real-time applications but have room for improvement in sample fidelity. Existing inference-time alignment methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs, and naive extensions of text-to-image noise refiners fail for video models.

Method: AutoRefiner introduces two key designs: 1) Pathwise noise refinement that refines noise along stochastic denoising paths, and 2) Reflective KV-cache mechanism. The method serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs without requiring parameter updates.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner effectively enhances sample fidelity in AR-VDMs by refining noise along denoising paths, serving as an efficient plug-in solution.

Conclusion: AutoRefiner successfully addresses the limitations of existing noise refinement methods for AR-VDMs, providing an efficient way to improve sample fidelity without computational overhead of optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

### [21] [SmokeBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Wildfire Smoke Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11215)
*Tianye Qi,Weihao Li,Nick Barnes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmokeBench benchmark evaluates MLLMs on wildfire smoke detection and localization, revealing models struggle with early-stage smoke localization despite some success with large smoke areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire smoke is visually similar to clouds and challenging to detect early, creating a need to evaluate multimodal large language models' capabilities for safety-critical wildfire monitoring.

Method: Created SmokeBench benchmark with four tasks: smoke classification, tile-based localization, grid-based localization, and smoke detection. Evaluated seven MLLMs including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro.

Result: Some models can classify smoke when it covers large areas, but all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in early stages. Smoke volume strongly correlates with performance, while contrast has minor impact.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have critical limitations for safety-critical wildfire monitoring, highlighting the need for improved methods for early-stage smoke localization.

Abstract: Wildfire smoke is transparent, amorphous, and often visually confounded with clouds, making early-stage detection particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.

### [22] [VFMF: World Modeling by Forecasting Vision Foundation Model Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11225)
*Gabrijel Boduljak,Yushi Lan,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative forecasting method using autoregressive flow matching in vision foundation model feature space, enabling stochastic prediction of multiple future modalities while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: pixel-based forecasting is computationally intensive and not directly useful for decision-making, while deterministic regression on VFM features averages over plausible futures and fails to capture uncertainty. There's a need for efficient, stochastic forecasting that can predict multiple useful modalities.

Method: Introduces generative forecasting via autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Key innovation: encodes VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion, which preserves information better than PCA-based alternatives. This enables stochastic conditional generation of future states that can be decoded into multiple modalities.

Result: The method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities (semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, RGB) with matched architecture and compute. The latent space preserves information effectively for both forecasting and other applications like image generation.

Conclusion: Stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models, combining computational efficiency with the ability to capture uncertainty and generate multiple interpretable output modalities.

Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutureX is a Chain of Thought-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end autonomous driving planners by enabling future scene reasoning and trajectory refinement through a dual-mode system (Thinking vs. Instant) based on scene complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving planners rely solely on current scene representations, which can lead to suboptimal responses in dynamic traffic environments where ego actions affect future scenes. There's a need to model scene evolution and enable complex reasoning about future interactions.

Method: FutureX uses a Chain of Thought approach with an Auto-think Switch that assesses scene complexity. For complex scenes, it enters Thinking mode where a Latent World Model performs CoT-guided rollouts to predict future scene representations, which a Summarizer Module uses to refine motion plans. For simple scenes, it operates in Instant mode with forward-pass planning.

Result: FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans with fewer collisions while maintaining efficiency. It achieves substantial performance gains, including 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM benchmark.

Conclusion: The CoT-driven approach enables end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning through future scene reasoning and trajectory refinement, addressing limitations of current-scene-only planning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REST is the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework that addresses slow inference speeds of diffusion models through compact video latent space, ID-Context Cache mechanism, and Asynchronous Streaming Distillation training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have advanced talking head generation but suffer from slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms that limit real-time applications. There's a need for diffusion-based models that can operate in real-time streaming scenarios.

Method: 1. Learn compact video latent space through high spatiotemporal VAE compression for real-time generation. 2. Introduce ID-Context Cache mechanism (ID-Sink + Context-Cache) for key-value caching to maintain temporal consistency and identity coherence during streaming. 3. Propose Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy using non-streaming teacher with asynchronous noise schedule to supervise streaming student model and mitigate error accumulation.

Result: REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance, bridging the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches for real-time talking head generation.

Conclusion: REST demonstrates substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation by enabling diffusion-based models to operate in streaming scenarios with improved speed and performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

*Wentang Chen,Shougao Zhang,Yiman Zhang,Tianhao Zhou,Ruihui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoomPilot is a unified framework for controllable 3D indoor scene generation that parses text or CAD floor plans into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) to create interactive, physically consistent environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for indoor scene generation are either limited in input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that reduce controllability. There's a need for a unified framework that can handle diverse inputs while maintaining fine-grained control and producing interactive, functional scenes rather than just visually plausible layouts.

Method: RoomPilot introduces an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) as a shared semantic representation that can parse both textual descriptions and CAD floor plans. It uses a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments with realistic object behaviors, enabling coherent scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments validate RoomPilot's strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity compared to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts.

Conclusion: RoomPilot represents a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation by providing a unified framework that handles diverse inputs while maintaining interaction semantics and producing high-quality, interactive environments suitable for game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training.

Abstract: Generating controllable and interactive indoor scenes is fundamental to applications in game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training. Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method for incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition that addresses performance gaps and modality under-optimization through progressive prompt generation, cross-modal knowledge propagation, and dynamic output re-weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition faces challenges due to performance gaps between modalities and modality under-optimization problems, which are exacerbated by missing data. Existing methods struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal information when data is partially observed.

Method: Proposed Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method with: 1) Progressive prompt generation module with dynamic gradient modulator to produce concise modality semantic cues; 2) Cross-modal knowledge propagation that selectively amplifies consistent information using prompts; 3) Coordinator that dynamically re-weights modality outputs as a complement to balance strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 state-of-the-art methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved recognition accuracy by enhancing modality-specific features and boosting each modality's performance.

Conclusion: The Cross-modal Prompting method successfully addresses the challenges of incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition by emphasizing coherent information through enhanced modality-specific features and improved overall recognition accuracy, demonstrating effectiveness across various missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition (IMER) aims at understanding human intentions and sentiments by comprehensively exploring the partially observed multi-source data. Although the multi-modal data is expected to provide more abundant information, the performance gap and modality under-optimization problem hinder effective multi-modal learning in practice, and are exacerbated in the confrontation of the missing data. To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is designed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 SOTA methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models focus on visual quality but overlook latency and real-time performance, limiting their application in live streaming scenarios.

Method: Uses hybrid implicit signals (implicit facial representations + 3D implicit keypoints) for motion control, fewer-step appearance distillation for efficiency, and autoregressive micro-chunk streaming with sliding training and historical keyframe mechanisms.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models, enabling low-latency stable long-term video generation.

Conclusion: PersonaLive successfully addresses the latency limitations of diffusion-based portrait animation, making real-time streaming applications feasible with significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

### [28] [Do We Need Reformer for Vision? An Experimental Comparison with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11260)
*Ali El Bellaj,Mohammed-Amine Cheddadi,Rhassan Berber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are computationally expensive due to quadratic self-attention scaling. This paper investigates Reformer architecture with locality-sensitive hashing attention to reduce complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n). While Reformer shows better accuracy on small datasets like CIFAR-10, ViTs outperform in practical efficiency on larger, high-resolution settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Vision Transformers suffer from computational inefficiency because global self-attention scales quadratically with token count, limiting their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained applications. The researchers aim to explore more efficient alternatives.

Method: The paper investigates Reformer architecture as a vision backbone, combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention. This approach approximates global self-attention while reducing theoretical time complexity from O(n²) to O(n log n). The model is evaluated on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and a high-resolution medical imaging dataset.

Result: Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to ViT baseline. However, ViT consistently outperforms Reformer in practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across larger and higher-resolution settings. The theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention don't translate to meaningful computation gains for typical high-resolution image sequences.

Conclusion: Despite theoretical complexity improvements, Reformer's LSH-based attention doesn't provide practical efficiency benefits for typical high-resolution vision tasks. ViTs remain more efficient in real-world scenarios, suggesting that meaningful computation gains require substantially longer sequences than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

Abstract: Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.
  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.
  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

*Rezwana Sultana,Manzur Murshed,Kathryn Sheffield,Singarayer Florentine,Tsz-Kwan Lee,Shyh Wei Teng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery can effectively monitor invasive serrated tussock grass at landscape scale, achieving comparable accuracy to aerial imagery but with better cost-effectiveness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Serrated tussock is a highly invasive grass causing ecological and agricultural damage in Victoria, Australia. Current ground surveys are effective but not scalable for landscape monitoring, while aerial imagery is too expensive for large-scale applications.

Method: Developed 11 models using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery with various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Used random forest classifier to evaluate performance against aerial imagery baselines.

Result: Best Sentinel-2 model (M76*) achieved 68% Overall Accuracy and 0.55 Overall Kappa, slightly outperforming the best aerial imaging model (67% OA, 0.52 OK) on the same dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models offer a cost-effective, scalable alternative for landscape-scale invasive species monitoring, demonstrating comparable performance to higher-resolution aerial imagery.

Abstract: Invasive species pose major global threats to ecosystems and agriculture. Serrated tussock (\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset. These findings highlight the potential of multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models for scalable invasive species classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FilmWeaver is a novel framework for generating consistent multi-shot videos of arbitrary length using autoregressive diffusion with dual-level cache mechanisms for inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models struggle with multi-shot videos, facing challenges in maintaining character/background consistency across shots and generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count.

Method: Uses autoregressive diffusion paradigm for arbitrary-length generation. Key innovation is decoupling consistency into inter-shot and intra-shot aspects via dual-level cache: shot memory (caches keyframes from preceding shots) and temporal memory (retains frame history from current shot). Supports flexible multi-round user interaction.

Result: Method surpasses existing approaches on both consistency and aesthetic quality metrics. Demonstrates versatility by supporting downstream tasks like multi-concept injection and video extension. Includes development of comprehensive pipeline for constructing high-quality multi-shot video dataset.

Conclusion: FilmWeaver opens new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content by addressing critical limitations in multi-shot video generation.

Abstract: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

TL;DR: RcAE: A recursive autoencoder architecture for unsupervised industrial anomaly detection that progressively suppresses anomalies through iterative reconstruction, with cross-recursion tracking and detail preservation for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoencoder-based anomaly detection methods struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details due to single-pass decoding, which fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale.

Method: Proposes Recursive Autoencoder (RcAE) with iterative reconstruction to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Includes Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module to track inconsistencies across recursion steps, and Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures lost during reconstruction.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters, and offers substantially faster inference.

Conclusion: The recursive architecture provides practical and efficient anomaly detection for real-world applications, balancing performance with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection requires accurately identifying defects without labeled data. Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference. These results highlight the practicality and efficiency of our approach for real-world applications.

TL;DR: ARVAE is an autoregressive video autoencoder that decouples temporal and spatial information using flow fields and spatial compensation, enabling efficient video compression and reconstruction with arbitrary lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance in video reconstruction and generation tasks.

Method: ARVAE processes videos autoregressively, compressing each frame conditioned on its predecessor. It uses temporal-spatial decoupled representation with downsampled flow fields for temporal coherence and spatial relative compensation for new content. The encoder extracts temporal motion and spatial supplement from current and previous frames, while the decoder reconstructs frames from latent representations given the preceding frame.

Result: ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. It demonstrates strong potential for downstream video generation applications.

Conclusion: ARVAE effectively addresses the spatial-temporal entanglement problem in video autoencoders, offering high compression efficiency without information loss and enabling flexible processing of arbitrary-length videos for various applications.

Abstract: Video autoencoders compress videos into compact latent representations for efficient reconstruction, playing a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of video generation. However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. Moreover, evaluations on video generation tasks highlight its strong potential for downstream applications.

TL;DR: A novel machine unlearning approach for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that selectively erases target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge using Visual Knowledge Distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing machine unlearning methods are designed for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains underdeveloped. There's a need for approaches that can selectively remove sensitive visual information from MLLMs while maintaining their textual capabilities.

Method: Proposes disentangling visual and textual knowledge in MLLMs, then introduces Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) that uses intermediate visual representations as supervision signals instead of output-level supervision. Only fine-tunes visual components of MLLM for efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. First to evaluate robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses MLLM unlearning challenges by selectively erasing visual knowledge while preserving textual capabilities, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

*Tanu Singh,Pranamesh Chakraborty,Long T. Truong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based model for traffic accident detection achieves 88.3% accuracy by combining RGB and optical flow features, outperforming vision language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road traffic accidents are a major global cause of mortality, but current computer vision methods for accident detection have limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Existing approaches also neglect motion cues essential for understanding dynamic accident scenes.

Method: Proposed a transformer-based accident detection model using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture combines convolutional layers for local correlations within frames with transformers for sequential-temporal dependencies. Multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated, with concatenating RGB features with optical flow proving most effective.

Result: The model achieved 88.3% accuracy when using concatenated RGB and optical flow features. This approach outperformed vision language models (GPT, Gemini, LLaVA-NeXT-Video) in comparative evaluation.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures with integrated motion cues (RGB + optical flow) provide effective automated traffic accident detection, addressing limitations of traditional methods and outperforming current vision language models.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flowception is a non-autoregressive video generation framework that combines discrete frame insertion with continuous denoising, offering better long-term context handling and computational efficiency than autoregressive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of existing video generation methods: autoregressive approaches suffer from error accumulation/drift, while full-sequence flows are computationally expensive and less flexible with attention mechanisms.

Method: Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising, creating a non-autoregressive framework that can handle variable-length videos and learn video length jointly with content.

Result: Quantitative results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, with 3x reduction in FLOPs for training compared to full-sequence flows.

Conclusion: Flowception provides an efficient, flexible video generation framework that handles long-term context better, reduces computational costs, and seamlessly integrates tasks like image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional top-K frame selection methods score frames independently, leading to temporally clustered and visually redundant selections. Also, training lightweight selectors with static pseudo labels from MLLMs prevents dynamic adaptation to task objectives.

Method: 1) Chain-of-Thought approach guides SLM to generate task-specific implicit query vectors combined with multimodal features for dynamic scoring. 2) Continuous set-level objective function with relevance, coverage, and redundancy optimized via Gumbel-Softmax. 3) Student-teacher mutual learning aligns frame importance distributions between SLM selector and MLLM reasoner via KL divergence and cross-entropy.

Result: Experiments across Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end trainable framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional frame selection methods by enabling task-adaptive dynamic scoring, set-level optimization, and eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels through mutual learning.

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATMapTR is a novel online HD map construction model that effectively fuses satellite images with BEV features through gated feature refinement and geometry-aware fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD maps need real-time construction but suffer from low-quality input data due to limited onboard sensors and occlusions. Satellite images offer wide-area views but are degraded by shadows and occlusions, and prior fusion methods remain ineffective.

Method: Proposes SATMapTR with two key components: (1) gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues, and (2) geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuses satellite and BEV features at grid-to-grid level.

Result: Achieves highest mAP of 73.8 on nuScenes dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. Shows lower mAP degradation under adverse conditions and achieves nearly 3× higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Conclusion: SATMapTR effectively addresses challenges in satellite image fusion for HD map construction, demonstrating superior accuracy, robustness to adverse conditions, and extended perception capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Conclusion: Skeleton-Cache effectively improves generalization to unseen actions through training-free test-time adaptation using structured skeleton representations and LLM-guided semantic priors.

Abstract: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise dental diagnosis, creating a need for specialized dental AI systems.

Method: Built largest annotated multimodal dental dataset (120k+ images with detailed descriptions), trained MLLM on this dataset for visual understanding, then applied reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.

Result: Superior performance on intraoral/panoramic benchmarks and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters.

Conclusion: High-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

TL;DR: KeyframeFace introduces a large-scale multimodal dataset and LLM-based framework for text-to-3D-facial-animation with keyframe-level supervision, addressing limitations in semantic grounding and temporal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation, focusing mainly on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences.

Method: Created KeyframeFace dataset with 2,100 expressive scripts paired with videos, ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, emotions, manual keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations via LLMs/MLLMs. Proposed first text-to-animation framework leveraging LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis.

Result: KeyframeFace establishes a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation, with code and data publicly available.

Conclusion: The dataset and LLM-based framework together enable high-fidelity expressive animation by aligning LLM semantic understanding with interpretable ARKit coefficient structure.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D facial animation from natural language requires understanding both temporally structured semantics and fine-grained expression changes. Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

TL;DR: MetaCanvas is a lightweight framework that enables multimodal LLMs to directly reason and plan in spatial/spatiotemporal latent spaces for precise control over diffusion-based visual generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs have strong reasoning capabilities for understanding complex scenes but are underutilized in visual generation, where they're typically reduced to simple text encoders for diffusion models, creating a gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Method: MetaCanvas framework allows MLLMs to reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces, tightly interfacing with diffusion generators. It's implemented on three different diffusion backbones and evaluated across six generation tasks.

Result: MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines across text-to-image, text/image-to-video, image/video editing, and in-context video generation tasks requiring precise layouts, attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control.

Conclusion: Treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation, enabling more precise and structured control in visual generation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

*Junqiao Wang,Yuanfei Huang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First video flare removal method using physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis and Mamba-based temporal modeling to handle motion-independent spatiotemporal flare characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare removal research focuses on images, leaving video flare spatiotemporal characteristics unexplored. Video flare poses greater challenges due to complex independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content, causing flicker and artifacts in restoration.

Method: 1) Physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline simulating light source motion with optical flow and modeling temporal behaviors of scattering/reflective flares. 2) Video flare removal network with attention module for spatial flare suppression and Mamba-based temporal modeling for long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, eliminating need for multi-frame alignment.

Result: Method outperforms existing video-based restoration and image-based flare removal methods on both real and synthetic videos. Effectively removes dynamic flares while preserving light source integrity and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. First video flare dataset constructed for comprehensive evaluation.

Conclusion: Proposed approach successfully addresses motion-independent spatiotemporal flare characteristics in videos, providing effective dynamic flare removal with improved temporal consistency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Lens flare is a degradation phenomenon caused by strong light sources. Existing researches on flare removal have mainly focused on images, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of video flare remain largely unexplored. Video flare synthesis and removal pose significantly greater challenges than in image, owing to the complex and mutually independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content. This motion independence further affects restoration performance, often resulting in flicker and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline, which simulates light source motion using optical flow and models the temporal behaviors of both scattering and reflective flares. Meanwhile, we design a video flare removal network that employs an attention module to spatially suppress flare regions and incorporates a Mamba-based temporal modeling component to capture long range spatio-temporal dependencies. This motion-independent spatiotemporal representation effectively eliminates the need for multi-frame alignment, alleviating temporal aliasing between flares and scene content and thereby improving video flare removal performance. Building upon this, we construct the first video flare dataset to comprehensively evaluate our method, which includes a large set of synthetic paired videos and additional real-world videos collected from the Internet to assess generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing video-based restoration and image-based flare removal methods on both real and synthetic videos, effectively removing dynamic flares while preserving light source integrity and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency of scene.

Conclusion: FreqDINO effectively addresses DINOv3's limitations for ultrasound segmentation by incorporating frequency guidance for enhanced boundary perception and structural consistency, showing strong performance and generalization in clinical ultrasound applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound image segmentation is pivotal for clinical diagnosis, yet challenged by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities.

TL;DR: Proposed a temporal information exchange method for calving front delineation in SAR imagery using multiple frames from time series to improve performance on challenging seasonal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for calving front delineation struggle with seasonal conditions like ice mélange and snow-covered surfaces, requiring improved temporal consistency in predictions.

Method: Process multiple frames from satellite image time series in parallel, exchange temporal information between corresponding feature maps to stabilize predictions, integrated into Tyrion architecture.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art on CaFFe benchmark: Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

Conclusion: Temporal information exchange across multiple frames significantly improves calving front delineation accuracy, especially for challenging seasonal conditions, advancing glacier monitoring capabilities.

Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

*Fei Long,Yao Zhang,Jiaming Lv,Jiangtao Xie,Peihua Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TS-FSAR improves few-shot action recognition with a visual Ladder Side Network for efficient CLIP fine-tuning, Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching for modeling complex inter-frame dependencies, and a guiding module to regularize training under limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot action recognition methods have two key limitations: 1) set matching metrics rely on cosine similarity and only capture linear dependencies, missing nonlinear relationships and task-specific cues; 2) efficient CLIP adaptation via skip-fusion layers is difficult to optimize with limited data.

Method: TS-FSAR framework with three components: 1) visual Ladder Side Network (LSN) for efficient CLIP fine-tuning; 2) Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching (TS-DCM) using α-distance correlation to model both linear and nonlinear inter-frame dependencies with task prototypes; 3) Guiding LSN with Adapted CLIP (GLAC) module to regularize LSN using frozen CLIP for better α-distance correlation estimation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that TS-FSAR yields superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TS-FSAR effectively addresses limitations in few-shot action recognition by improving set matching with nonlinear dependency modeling and enhancing CLIP adaptation through better regularization under limited supervision.

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has recently made notable progress through set matching and efficient adaptation of large-scale pre-trained models. However, two key limitations persist. First, existing set matching metrics typically rely on cosine similarity to measure inter-frame linear dependencies and then perform matching with only instance-level information, thus failing to capture more complex patterns such as nonlinear relationships and overlooking task-specific cues. Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost. However, the newly introduced side layers are often difficult to optimize under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose TS-FSAR, a framework comprising three components: (1) a visual Ladder Side Network (LSN) for efficient CLIP fine-tuning; (2) a metric called Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching (TS-DCM), which uses $α$-distance correlation to model both linear and nonlinear inter-frame dependencies and leverages a task prototype to enable task-specific matching; and (3) a Guiding LSN with Adapted CLIP (GLAC) module, which regularizes LSN using the adapted frozen CLIP to improve training for better $α$-distance correlation estimation under limited supervision. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our TS-FSAR yields superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-arts.

*Kai Yao,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic security evaluation of model fingerprint detection for AI-generated images reveals significant vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, with removal attacks being highly effective and forgery attacks varying in success across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While model fingerprint detection techniques show promise for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, their robustness under adversarial conditions remains unexplored, creating a critical gap in understanding their security properties.

Method: Formalized threat models covering white- and black-box access with two attack goals (fingerprint removal and forgery). Implemented five attack strategies and evaluated 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators.

Result: Significant gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks highly effective (80%+ success in white-box, 50%+ in black-box). Forgery more challenging but success varies across models. Utility-robustness trade-off identified: highest accuracy methods often most vulnerable. No method achieved high robustness and accuracy across all threat models.

Conclusion: Current fingerprint detection techniques have significant security vulnerabilities. Need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, with identified promising approaches for advancing this goal.

Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Developed a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system (UW-SLD) for pipeline corrosion detection using multi-source information fusion and adaptive algorithms for robust defect reconstruction in challenging underwater environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater pipelines are highly susceptible to corrosion, posing safety risks and shortening service life. Manual inspection is unreliable, so intelligent real-time imaging systems are needed. Structured light 3D imaging can provide sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization, but underwater environments present challenges like distortions, sensor calibration issues, and disturbances.

Method: Developed UW-SLD system with: 1) Rapid distortion correction (FDC) for underwater image rectification; 2) Factor graph-based parameter optimization for extrinsic calibration between structured light and acoustic sensors; 3) Multi-mode 3D imaging strategy for pipeline geometric variability; 4) Multi-source information fusion and adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) for stable pose estimation; 5) Edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm combining pipeline edge detection network with enhanced point cloud registration for robust defect reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments under different operation modes, velocities, and depths demonstrated superior accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. The system provides stable pose estimation, high-accuracy measurements, and robust high-fidelity reconstruction of defect structures even under variable motion conditions.

Conclusion: The developed UW-SLD system achieves superior performance in underwater pipeline detection, providing a solid foundation for autonomous underwater pipeline inspection with reliable defect characterization capabilities in challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: Underwater pipelines are highly susceptible to corrosion, which not only shorten their service life but also pose significant safety risks. Compared with manual inspection, the intelligent real-time imaging system for underwater pipeline detection has become a more reliable and practical solution. Among various underwater imaging techniques, structured light 3D imaging can restore the sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization. Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification. To overcome the challenges of extrinsic calibration among underwater sensors, a factor graph-based parameter optimization method is proposed to estimate the transformation matrix between the structured light and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, a multi-mode 3D imaging strategy is introduced to adapt to the geometric variability of underwater pipelines. Given the presence of numerous disturbances in underwater environments, a multi-source information fusion strategy and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) are designed to ensure stable pose estimation and high-accuracy measurements. In particular, an edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates pipeline edge detection network with enhanced point cloud registration to achieve robust and high-fidelity reconstruction of defect structures even under variable motion conditions. Extensive experiments are conducted under different operation modes, velocities, and depths. The results demonstrate that the developed system achieves superior accuracy, adaptability and robustness, providing a solid foundation for autonomous underwater pipeline detection.

TL;DR: A fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular RGB videos that enhances Dynamic Gaussian Splatting priors using video segmentation, epipolar-error maps, and novel loss functions to improve reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a fully automatic system for reconstructing dynamic scenes from casually captured monocular RGB videos, overcoming limitations of previous methods in handling thin structures, floaters, and motion coherence.

Method: Enhances Dynamic Gaussian Splatting priors using video segmentation with epipolar-error maps to create object-level masks. These masks guide object-depth loss for sharper depth, support skeleton-based sampling with mask-guided re-identification for reliable 2D tracks. Adds virtual-view depth loss to remove floaters and scaffold-projection loss to tie motion nodes to tracks.

Result: The system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings.

Conclusion: The proposed fully automatic pipeline successfully improves dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos by enhancing priors in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting through novel segmentation, tracking, and loss functions.

Abstract: We introduce a fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured monocular RGB videos. Rather than designing a new scene representation, we enhance the priors that drive Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Video segmentation combined with epipolar-error maps yields object-level masks that closely follow thin structures; these masks (i) guide an object-depth loss that sharpens the consistent video depth, and (ii) support skeleton-based sampling plus mask-guided re-identification to produce reliable, comprehensive 2-D tracks. Two additional objectives embed the refined priors in the reconstruction stage: a virtual-view depth loss removes floaters, and a scaffold-projection loss ties motion nodes to the tracks, preserving fine geometry and coherent motion. The resulting system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARNet-v2 proposes a novel camouflaged object detection model with Channel Information Interaction Module for cross-channel feature enhancement and collaborative decoding architecture with boundary/region priors to address semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current COD methods have two critical issues: insufficient cross-channel information interaction within same-layer features, and inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries.

Method: 1) Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM) with horizontal-vertical integration mechanism for cross-channel feature reorganization and interaction. 2) Collaborative decoding architecture with Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules to generate boundary priors and object localization maps, using hybrid attention for feature calibration. 3) Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module for contextual feature enrichment.

Result: Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate state-of-the-art performance. The model also demonstrates adaptability across downstream tasks including salient object detection, polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial/road defect detection.

Conclusion: The proposed ARNet-v2 effectively addresses cross-channel information interaction and boundary-region co-modeling challenges in COD, achieving superior performance and demonstrating strong transferability to various downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep neural networks for semantic segmentation are limited to predefined classes and fail when encountering unknown objects in open-world scenarios like automated driving, where recognizing out-of-distribution objects is crucial for safety.

Method: The authors propose an evidence segmentation framework using a Wasserstein loss that captures distributional distances while respecting probability simplex geometry, combined with Kullback-Leibler regularization and Dice structural consistency terms.

Result: The approach leads to improved out-of-distribution segmentation performance compared to uncertainty-based approaches.

Conclusion: The evidence segmentation framework with Wasserstein loss provides a more effective solution for recognizing and segmenting unknown objects in open-world scenarios, which is essential for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve superior performance in semantic segmentation, but are limited to a predefined set of classes, which leads to failures when they encounter unknown objects in open-world scenarios. Recognizing and segmenting these out-of-distribution (OOD) objects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as automated driving. In this work, we present an evidence segmentation framework using a Wasserstein loss, which captures distributional distances while respecting the probability simplex geometry. Combined with Kullback-Leibler regularization and Dice structural consistency terms, our approach leads to improved OOD segmentation performance compared to uncertainty-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the N-Body Problem: how N individuals can parallelize tasks from a single egocentric video while respecting physical constraints, and proposes a structured prompting method for VLMs to achieve this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can intuitively parallelize complex activities, but current models struggle to learn this from observing a single person's video. The challenge is to assign video segments to multiple individuals while avoiding physically impossible scenarios like object conflicts or spatial collisions.

Method: Formalizes the N-Body Problem and proposes evaluation metrics for both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts, causal constraints). Introduces a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model to reason about 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce viable parallel execution.

Result: On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, the method for N=2 boosts action coverage by 45% over baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while reducing collision rates, object conflicts, and causal conflicts by 55%, 45%, and 55% respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed structured prompting approach enables VLMs to effectively solve the N-Body Problem, achieving significant improvements in both task coverage and feasibility constraints compared to naive baselines.

Abstract: Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution.

*Yilei Jiang,Zhen Wang,Yanghao Wang,Jun Yu,Yueting Zhuang,Jun Xiao,Long Chen*

TL;DR: FlowDC is a text-to-image editing method that handles complex editing with multiple targets by decoupling them into parallel sub-editing effects and decomposing velocity to preserve source structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image editing methods struggle with complex editing containing multiple targets. Single-round editing has long text following issues, while multi-round editing suffers from cumulative inconsistency. Neither can balance semantic alignment with source consistency effectively.

Method: FlowDC decouples complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during editing. It also decomposes velocity into components, decaying the orthogonal part to better preserve source structure.

Result: FlowDC shows superior results compared to existing methods on two benchmarks, including the newly constructed Complex-PIE-Bench for complex editing evaluation.

Conclusion: FlowDC effectively addresses complex text-to-image editing by parallel decoupling of editing effects and velocity decomposition, achieving better balance between semantic alignment and source consistency than previous approaches.

Abstract: With the surge of pre-trained text-to-image flow matching models, text-based image editing performance has gained remarkable improvement, especially for \underline{simple editing} that only contains a single editing target. To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench. On two benchmarks, FlowDC shows superior results compared with existing methods. We also detail the ablations of our module designs.

TL;DR: CRR framework transforms reconstruction to repairation for multi-class industrial anomaly detection, addressing identity mapping issues by training decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing anomalies, with feature masking and segmentation network for localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection is challenging due to unknown anomalous patterns. Separate models per class cause memory issues and limited generalizability. Conventional reconstruction networks suffer from identity mapping problems where they replicate inputs regardless of normality, leading to detection failures.

Method: Proposes Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR) framework: 1) Optimizes decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies, generating distinct representations for anomalies; 2) Uses feature-level random masking to ensure decoder representations contain sufficient local information; 3) Trains segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks to minimize detection errors from encoder-decoder discrepancies.

Result: Extensive experiments on industrial datasets show CRR effectively mitigates identity mapping issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.

Conclusion: CRR framework successfully addresses identity mapping problem in reconstruction-based anomaly detection, providing an effective unified solution for multi-class industrial anomaly detection with improved localization performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a challenging open-set task that aims to identify unknown anomalous patterns deviating from normal data distribution. To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output. Second, we implement feature-level random masking to ensure that the representations from decoder contain sufficient local information. Finally, to minimize detection errors arising from the discrepancies between feature representations from the encoder and decoder, we train a segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks, thereby enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets that CRR effectively mitigates the identity mapping issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have high computational overhead and cannot synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods suffer from error accumulation and quality degradation problems.

Method: Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB) allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation; Motion Condition Injection (MCI) enhances temporal coherence by using noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR) enables infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding.

Result: The 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

Conclusion: JoyAvatar successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling real-time inference and infinite-length video generation while maintaining high quality and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue causes 24% of road accidents, and yawning is an early indicator. Existing ML approaches suffer from noisy video annotations that limit accuracy.

Method: Developed semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification to create YawDD+ dataset. Trained MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector on this enhanced dataset.

Conclusion: Enhanced data quality enables accurate on-device yawning monitoring without server computation, providing practical solution for driver fatigue detection.

Abstract: Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24\% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, which we apply to YawDD, enabling more accurate model training. Training the established MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector architectures on YawDD+ improves frame accuracy by up to 6\% and mAP by 5\% over video-level supervision, achieving 99.34\% classification accuracy and 95.69\% detection mAP. The resulting approach deliver up to 59.8 FPS on edge AI hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano), confirming that enhanced data quality alone supports on-device yawning monitoring without server-side computation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS is a self-supervised learning framework for 3D point clouds that distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable points, preventing information leakage and addressing unbalanced semantics through Zipfian prototypes with a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL for 3D point clouds faces challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. Existing methods struggle with information leakage from masked regions and lack rich supervision beyond discrete token assignments.

Method: Proposes DOS framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. Introduces Zipfian prototypes with Zipf-Sinkhorn algorithm that enforces power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates target softmap sharpness during training.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, ScanNet200) without extra data or annotations.

Conclusion: Observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations, addressing key challenges in SSL for point clouds through information leakage prevention and balanced semantics handling.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.

*Weijian Ma,Shizhao Sun,Ruiyu Wang,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADMorph is an iterative framework for geometry-driven parametric CAD editing that uses pretrained foundation models to synchronize geometric shape changes with underlying parametric sequences while preserving structure, ensuring semantic validity, and maintaining shape fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: During iterative CAD design, geometric shape adjustments require synchronized edits to underlying parametric sequences, which must preserve original structure, ensure semantic validity, and maintain shape fidelity - all under scarce editing data triplets.

Method: CADMorph uses an iterative plan-generate-verify framework with pretrained domain-specific foundation models: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. Planning uses cross-attention maps to identify modification segments, generation infills masks with valid edits, and verification measures shape-latent distance to target.

Result: CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, supports downstream applications like iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement, and bypasses data-scarcity bottleneck by training without triplet data.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses geometry-driven parametric CAD editing by leveraging pretrained priors' geometric consciousness and design knowledge to handle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively through its three-stage approach.

Abstract: A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model encodes an object in two coupled forms: a parametric construction sequence and its resulting visible geometric shape. During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSA³D: A self-supervised assisted framework for automatic dental abutment design that eliminates separate pre-training/fine-tuning through dual-branch architecture and text-conditioned prompts, achieving state-of-the-art performance with half the training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual abutment design is tedious and time-consuming, while AI automation faces data scarcity issues. Traditional self-supervised learning requires separate pre-training and fine-tuning, resulting in high computational costs and long training times.

Method: Proposes SS$A^3$D with dual-branch architecture: reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scans and transfers structural knowledge to regression branch, which predicts abutment parameters under supervised learning. Includes Text-Conditioned Prompt module to incorporate clinical information (implant location, system, series) to guide network focus and constrain predictions.

Result: SS$A^3$D saves half the training time compared to traditional SSL methods while achieving higher accuracy. Achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods, significantly improving accuracy and efficiency of automated abutment design.

Conclusion: The proposed SS$A^3$D framework effectively addresses data scarcity in dental abutment design by eliminating separate pre-training/fine-tuning, reducing computational costs, and incorporating clinical information through text-conditioned prompts, resulting in more efficient and accurate automated abutment design.

Abstract: Abutment design is a critical step in dental implant restoration. However, manual design involves tedious measurement and fitting, and research on automating this process with AI is limited, due to the unavailability of large annotated datasets. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate data scarcity, its need for pre-training and fine-tuning results in high computational costs and long training times. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised assisted automatic abutment design framework (SS$A^3$D), which employs a dual-branch architecture with a reconstruction branch and a regression branch. The reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scan data and transfers the learned structural information to the regression branch. The regression branch then predicts the abutment parameters under supervised learning, which eliminates the separate pre-training and fine-tuning process. We also design a Text-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module to incorporate clinical information (such as implant location, system, and series) into SS$A^3$D. This guides the network to focus on relevant regions and constrains the parameter predictions. Extensive experiments on a collected dataset show that SS$A^3$D saves half of the training time and achieves higher accuracy than traditional SSL methods. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of automated abutment design.

TL;DR: VGGT is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in one pass. This paper analyzes whether VGGT learns geometric concepts like traditional methods or relies on appearance-based priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether VGGT builds upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods or primarily relies on learned appearance-based data-driven priors, and to uncover how geometric understanding emerges within its representations.

Method: Systematic analysis through probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, performing interventions, spatial input masking, and perturbation experiments to examine how VGGT implements its functionality and assess robustness.

Result: VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. The model internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Conclusion: VGGT develops geometric understanding through its attention mechanisms, combining learned data priors with implicit geometric reasoning, bridging traditional geometry-based approaches with modern data-driven foundation models.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Abstract: Achieving compositional alignment between textual descriptions and generated images - covering objects, attributes, and spatial relationships - remains a core challenge for modern text-to-image (T2I) models. Although diffusion-based architectures have been widely studied, the compositional behavior of emerging Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models is still largely unexamined.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering clinical applications of deep learning models. While most state-of-the-art methods require fully-supervised learning with large annotated datasets, semi-supervised learning offers a promising alternative to reduce labeling costs while maintaining performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DTeethSAM adapts SAM2 for 3D teeth segmentation using 2D rendering, 2D-3D projection, and three learnable modules plus DGAP plugins to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D teeth segmentation is critical for digital dentistry but challenging due to real-world dentition complexity. Existing methods need improvement in accuracy and efficiency for practical clinical applications.

Method: Adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth by: 1) rendering 3D models into 2D images from predefined views, 2) using SAM2 for 2D segmentation, 3) reconstructing 3D results via 2D-3D projection, 4) adding three learnable modules (prompt embedding generator, mask refiner, mask classifier), and 5) incorporating Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's encoder.

Result: Achieved 91.90% IoU on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark with high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in 3D teeth segmentation.

Conclusion: 3DTeethSAM successfully adapts the foundation model SAM2 for 3D dental segmentation through innovative 2D-3D projection and lightweight learnable modules, demonstrating superior performance and practical potential for digital dentistry applications.

Abstract: 3D teeth segmentation, involving the localization of tooth instances and their semantic categorization in 3D dental models, is a critical yet challenging task in digital dentistry due to the complexity of real-world dentition. In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process. Our method has been validated on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark, achieving an IoU of 91.90% on high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel benchmark for evaluating in-context 3D scene understanding of foundation models without finetuning, using the 3D Multi-View ImageNet dataset to test segmentation of novel views based on key-query view contrast.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations rely on downstream finetuning with task-specific components, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. There's a need for benchmarks that directly probe dense visual features without finetuning for real-world applications like robotics and autonomous driving.

Method: Extends the Hummingbird framework for 2D scene understanding to 3D using the MVImgNet dataset. Given images of objects from specific angles (keys), the method benchmarks segmentation performance on novel views (queries). Performance is categorized into easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on key-query view contrast differences.

Result: Benchmarked 8 state-of-the-art foundation models. DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark effectively isolates and evaluates the intrinsic 3D reasoning capabilities of foundation models without finetuning, revealing differences in how various models handle viewpoint changes and providing insights for improving 3D spatial understanding in real-world applications.

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream finetuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no finetuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

*Fabian Fuchs,Mario Ruben Fernandez,Norman Ettrich,Janis Keuper*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextSeisNet introduces in-context learning for seismic demultiple processing, using spatially related example pairs to achieve better lateral consistency and user control compared to traditional methods and U-Net baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional seismic processing methods face challenges with noisy data and manual parameter tuning, while existing deep learning approaches suffer from spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack user control.

Method: ContextSeisNet uses in-context learning by conditioning predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs - neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows task-specific learning at inference time without retraining.

Result: On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms U-Net quantitatively and shows enhanced spatial coherence. On field data, it achieves superior lateral consistency compared to traditional Radon demultiple and U-Net, with improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. It achieves comparable performance despite being trained on 90% less data.

Conclusion: ContextSeisNet establishes a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks, offering flexibility through user-defined examples and improved data efficiency.

Abstract: Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents are evaluated mostly on commodity software (Word, Excel), but professional CAD suites promise higher economic return and remain the weakest performance domain for agents, far from replacing expert EDA engineers.

Method: Created GUI-EDA dataset with 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains (2,000+ screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA experts), benchmarked 30+ mainstream GUI agents, and developed EDAgent with reflection mechanism for specialized EDA performance.

Conclusion: This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains (EDA), offering new avenue for advancing EDA productivity and demonstrating feasibility of AI agents in complex engineering workflows.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents adopt an end-to-end paradigm that maps a screenshot to an action sequence, thereby automating repetitive tasks in virtual environments. However, existing GUI agents are evaluated almost exclusively on commodity software such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Professional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) suites promise an order-of-magnitude higher economic return, yet remain the weakest performance domain for existing agents and are still far from replacing expert Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) engineers. We therefore present the first systematic study that deploys GUI agents for EDA workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale dataset named GUI-EDA, including 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains, comprising 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA scientists and engineers during real-world component design; (2) a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, demonstrating that EDA tasks constitute a major, unsolved challenge; and (3) an EDA-specialized metric named EDAgent, equipped with a reflection mechanism that achieves reliable performance on industrial CAD software and, for the first time, outperforms Ph.D. students majored in Electrical Engineering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gaussian-based explicit representation replaces neural implicit representations for 3D medical image reconstruction, providing 5-10× speed-up via closed-form analytical solution instead of stochastic sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution 3D reconstruction from motion-corrupted 2D fetal MRI is crucial for neurodevelopmental diagnosis, but current implicit neural representations suffer from computational bottlenecks requiring expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling.

Method: Shift from neural implicit representations to Gaussian explicit representations, parameterizing 3D volume as anisotropic Gaussian primitives, leveraging closure under convolution to derive closed-form analytical solution (covariance addition) for forward model.

Result: Matches reconstruction quality of state-of-the-art self-supervised SVR frameworks while achieving 5-10× speed-up on neonatal and fetal data, with convergence often reached in under 30 seconds.

Conclusion: Gaussian-based explicit representation enables fast, high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for clinical translation, particularly for real-time fetal 3D MRI applications.

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FactorPortrait is a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that transfers facial expressions and head movements from a driving video to a single portrait image while enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary camera viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to create a method for lifelike portrait animation that provides disentangled control over facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints from minimal input (single portrait image and driving video).

Method: Uses a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from driving video, injects them into video diffusion transformer via expression controller, employs Plücker ray maps and normal maps for camera/head pose control, and trains on a large-scale synthetic dataset with diverse camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expressions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

Conclusion: FactorPortrait successfully enables controllable portrait animation with disentangled control over facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We introduce FactorPortrait, a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that enables lifelike synthesis from disentangled control signals of facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints. Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

*Luca Cazzola,Ahed Alboody*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineMIC adapts Text-to-Motion models for Human Activity Recognition by using CLIP text embeddings to bridge the domain gap, enabling few-shot action synthesis with only 10 samples per class and achieving +23.1% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of annotated motion datasets creates a bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition. While Text-to-Motion models offer scalable synthetic data, their focus on artistic motion differs from HAR's need for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions, creating a significant domain gap.

Method: KineMIC is a transfer learning framework that adapts T2M diffusion models to HAR domains. It uses a kinetic mining strategy leveraging CLIP text embeddings to establish semantic correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data, providing soft supervision for kinematic distillation and transforming generalist T2M models into specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generators.

Result: Validated using HumanML3D as source T2M dataset and NTU RGB+D 120 subset as target HAR domain with only 10 samples per action class. The approach generates significantly more coherent motions and provides robust data augmentation, delivering a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

Conclusion: KineMIC successfully bridges the domain gap between generalist Text-to-Motion models and Human Activity Recognition requirements, enabling effective few-shot action synthesis and providing substantial performance improvements for HAR classifiers through synthetic data augmentation.

Abstract: The acquisition cost for large, annotated motion datasets remains a critical bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLV-Net is a visual prompt-guided multimodal image understanding framework that uses bounding box cues to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions, with context-aware modeling of inter-object relationships for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning methods struggle with user-relevant region steering using simple text prompts, and face challenges with visually similar objects and rich inter-object relationships in large-scale aerial imagery.

Method: Proposes CLV-Net with Context-Aware Mask Decoder to model inter-object relationships, and Semantic and Relationship Alignment module with Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss and Relationship Consistency Loss for fine-grained discrimination and alignment.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on two benchmark datasets, establishing new state-of-the-art results with effective user intent capture and precise multimodal outputs.

Conclusion: CLV-Net successfully addresses challenges in visual prompt-guided multimodal image understanding by integrating context-aware modeling and cross-modal alignment, producing intention-aligned outputs for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in image understanding have enabled methods that leverage large language models for multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results. The model effectively captures user intent and produces precise, intention-aligned multimodal outputs.

*Qiushi Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth Copy Paste is a multimodal, depth-aware augmentation framework that generates realistic face detection training samples by intelligently pasting full-body person instances into semantically compatible backgrounds using depth guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional copy-paste augmentation produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics, limiting face detection robustness under challenging conditions.

Method: Uses BLIP and CLIP for semantic/visual coherence assessment to retrieve suitable backgrounds, integrates SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything for non-occluded region extraction, and employs depth-guided sliding window placement for optimal depth continuity and scale alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show Depth Copy Paste generates more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared to traditional copy-paste and depth-free methods.

Conclusion: Depth Copy Paste addresses limitations of traditional augmentation by ensuring physical consistency through multimodal semantic assessment and depth-aware placement, resulting in more effective training data for robust face detection.

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditMGT is a new image editing framework using Masked Generative Transformers that achieves localized editing by preserving non-target regions, outperforming diffusion models in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image editing have a fundamental limitation: their global denoising process causes unintended modifications in non-target regions because they conflate local editing targets with full-image context. The authors seek an alternative approach that can preserve non-relevant areas during editing.

Method: The authors propose EditMGT, the first MGT-based image editing framework. They leverage MGT's cross-attention maps for localization, develop a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme for precise region identification, and introduce region-hold sampling to restrict token flipping to low-attention areas. They adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an editing model via attention injection without adding parameters, trained on their new CrispEdit-2M dataset.

Result: EditMGT achieves similarity performance with diffusion models while being 6 times faster and using fewer than 1B parameters. It shows 3.6% improvement on style change tasks and 17.6% improvement on style transfer tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Masked Generative Transformers provide a superior alternative to diffusion models for image editing due to their localized decoding paradigm, enabling precise editing while preserving non-target regions. EditMGT demonstrates that MGTs can achieve better editing quality with significantly faster inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.

*Yilmaz Korkmaz,Jay N. Paranjape,Celso M. de Melo,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Referring Change Detection (RCD), a novel approach that uses natural language prompts to detect specific types of changes in remote sensing images, overcoming limitations of traditional change detection methods that don't distinguish change types or rely on rigid semantic classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional change detection methods identify all changes without distinguishing types, which may not align with specific user needs. Semantic change detection methods have rigid class definitions and fixed architectures that limit dataset mixing and model reuse across tasks.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: (1) RCDNet - a cross-modal fusion network for referring change detection that integrates language understanding with visual analysis, and (2) RCDGen - a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that creates realistic post-change images and change maps using only pre-change images, without needing semantic segmentation masks.

Result: Experiments across multiple datasets show the framework enables scalable and targeted change detection, addressing challenges of limited annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets.

Conclusion: The RCD framework provides a flexible, scalable solution for targeted change detection in remote sensing by leveraging natural language prompts and synthetic data generation, overcoming limitations of traditional methods and enabling more user-specific applications.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection. Project website is here: https://yilmazkorkmaz1.github.io/RCD.

*Yan Zhang,Han Zou,Lincong Feng,Cong Xie,Ruiqi Yu,Zhenpeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel approach to music-to-dance generation by reframing it as music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis, using pose sequences encoded as one-hot images and modeled with a DiT-style backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key challenge is generating temporally coherent, rhythm-aligned 2D poses from music, especially under complex, high-variance in-the-wild distributions, as existing pose-to-video models can already translate pose sequences into photorealistic dance videos.

Method: Reframe music-to-dance generation as music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis: encode 2D pose sequences as one-hot images, compress with pretrained image VAE, model with DiT-style backbone. Introduce time-shared temporal indexing for synchronization and reference-pose conditioning for subject-specific body proportions and long-horizon generation.

Result: Experiments on large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference. Ablations validate contributions of representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of generating rhythm-aligned, temporally coherent 2D dance poses from music by leveraging advances from text-to-image models and introducing novel synchronization and conditioning techniques.

Abstract: Recent pose-to-video models can translate 2D pose sequences into photorealistic, identity-preserving dance videos, so the key challenge is to generate temporally coherent, rhythm-aligned 2D poses from music, especially under complex, high-variance in-the-wild distributions. We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

TL;DR: Weak-to-strong generalization method for automated training of Mask-RCNN with efficient channel attention to segment overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex IF whole-slide images without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent whole-slide images without requiring human annotations, especially for new instruments/protocols, and to provide automated quality assessment in production environments where manual proofreading is impractical.

Method: Multi-head extension of Mask-RCNN with efficient channel attention using weak-to-strong generalization methodology with pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion for automated training without human annotations.

Result: Benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed significant improvement. Code, sample images, and high-resolution segmentation results provided openly for community adoption.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables de novo segmentation of new image classes from new instruments/protocols without human annotations, with automated quality self-diagnosis for production environments.

Abstract: We present a weak to strong generalization methodology for fully automated training of a multi-head extension of the Mask-RCNN method with efficient channel attention for reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent (IF) whole-slide images (WSI), and present evidence for pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, the key phenomena underlying weak to strong generalization. This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.

Motivation: Visual generation using Visual Foundation Model representations offers a unified pathway for visual understanding, perception, and generation, but training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within VFM representation space remains unexplored.

Method: Scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework to support text-to-image synthesis directly in VFM feature domain using a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench, validating the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of representation-driven visual generation, with full open-source release of models, training pipelines, and pre-trained weights to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

*Mohammad Dehghanmanshadi,Wallapak Tavanapong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InST-based style transfer for biomedical microscopy images improves cell counting performance by reducing domain gap between synthetic and real data, achieving up to 37% lower MAE than hard-coded synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, but traditional domain adaptation methods struggle with complex textures and visual patterns of real samples.

Method: Adapt Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework to biomedical microscopy by combining latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones while preserving content structure.

Result: Models trained with InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37% lower MAE than hard-coded synthetic data, 52% reduction compared to Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE), and outperform real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements with DACS and CutMix.

Conclusion: InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data, offering scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

### [83] [MatAnyone 2: Scaling Video Matting via a Learned Quality Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11782)
*Peiqing Yang,Shangchen Zhou,Kai Hao,Qingyi Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) to assess alpha matte quality without ground truth, uses it to create a large-scale real-world video matting dataset (VMReal), and proposes a reference-frame training strategy for improved video matting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is limited by small datasets and lack of realistic data. Existing methods using segmentation data often produce segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details due to insufficient boundary supervision.

Method: 1) Develop a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality without ground truth, producing pixel-wise evaluation maps. 2) Use MQE for online training feedback and offline data curation to build VMReal dataset (28K clips, 2.4M frames). 3) Introduce reference-frame training strategy incorporating long-range frames beyond local windows.

Result: Created VMReal dataset (28K clips, 2.4M frames). MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing all prior methods across all metrics.

Conclusion: The MQE enables effective quality assessment without ground truth, facilitates large-scale dataset creation, and combined with reference-frame training, leads to superior video matting performance that addresses both semantic stability and fine boundary details.

Abstract: Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.

*Wentao Jiang,Vamsi Varra,Caitlin Perez-Stable,Harrison Zhu,Meredith Apicella,Nicole Nyamongo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trustworthy frequency-aware segmentation framework for quantifying vitiligo extent in clinical photos, combining domain-adaptive pre-training, architectural refinements with high-frequency spectral gating, and uncertainty estimation for clinical reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate quantification of vitiligo extent in clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response, requiring trustworthy automated segmentation methods that can handle subtle textures and provide reliable uncertainty estimates for clinical use.

Method: Three synergistic pillars: (1) Data-efficient training with domain-adaptive pre-training on ISIC 2019 dataset and ROI-constrained dual-task loss; (2) Architectural refinement using ConvNeXt V2 encoder enhanced with High-Frequency Spectral Gating module and stem-skip connections; (3) Clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation for pixel-wise uncertainty maps.

Result: Superior performance with Dice score of 85.05%, significantly reduced boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming CNN (ResNet-50, UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. High reliability with zero catastrophic failures and interpretable entropy maps.

Conclusion: The proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment, providing trustworthy segmentation with uncertainty quantification for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.

*Yang Fei,George Stoica,Jingyuan Liu,Qifeng Chen,Ranjay Krishna,Xiaojuan Wang,Benlin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM2VideoX distills structure-preserving motion priors from SAM2 into CogVideoX using bidirectional feature fusion and Local Gram Flow loss, achieving state-of-the-art video generation quality with improved motion fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic, structure-preserving motion for articulated and deformable objects (like humans and animals) remains challenging for video diffusion models. Current approaches rely on noisy motion representations (optical flow, skeletons) and scaling training data hasn't solved physically implausible transitions.

Method: Two key innovations: (1) bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX); (2) Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together.

Result: SAM2VideoX achieves consistent gains: +2.60% on VBench (95.51% vs REPA's 92.91%), 21-22% lower FVD scores, and 71.4% human preference over prior baselines. Specifically reduces FVD to 360.57, representing 21.20% and 22.46% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully distills structure-preserving motion priors from tracking models into diffusion models, enabling more realistic and physically plausible video generation for articulated and deformable objects, setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-RGBX is the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing that unifies video inverse rendering, photorealistic synthesis from intrinsic representations, and keyframe-based editing conditioned on intrinsic channels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale video generation models lack a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (albedo, normal, material, irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations.

Method: V-RGBX uses an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. It unifies three capabilities: video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels.

Result: Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. It surpasses prior methods in applications including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting.

Conclusion: V-RGBX presents the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse applications and superior performance compared to prior methods through its unified approach to intrinsic representation understanding and manipulation.

Motivation: ASR is increasingly used to document clinical encounters, but its reliability in multilingual and demographically diverse Indian healthcare contexts remains largely unknown, creating a need for systematic evaluation.

Method: Conducted systematic audit comparing leading ASR models (Indic Whisper, Whisper, Sarvam, Google speech to text, Gemma3n, Omnilingual, Vaani, Gemini) on real-world clinical interview data spanning Kannada, Hindi, and Indian English, evaluating transcription accuracy across languages, speakers, and demographic subgroups.

Result: Substantial variability across models and languages, with some systems performing competitively on Indian English but failing on code-mixed or vernacular speech; systematic performance gaps tied to speaker role and gender were uncovered.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for culturally and demographically inclusive ASR development for healthcare ecosystem in India, raising concerns about equitable deployment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly used to document clinical encounters, yet its reliability in multilingual and demographically diverse Indian healthcare contexts remains largely unknown. In this study, we conduct the first systematic audit of ASR performance on real world clinical interview data spanning Kannada, Hindi, and Indian English, comparing leading models including Indic Whisper, Whisper, Sarvam, Google speech to text, Gemma3n, Omnilingual, Vaani, and Gemini. We evaluate transcription accuracy across languages, speakers, and demographic subgroups, with a particular focus on error patterns affecting patients vs. clinicians and gender based or intersectional disparities. Our results reveal substantial variability across models and languages, with some systems performing competitively on Indian English but failing on code mixed or vernacular speech. We also uncover systematic performance gaps tied to speaker role and gender, raising concerns about equitable deployment in clinical settings. By providing a comprehensive multilingual benchmark and fairness analysis, our work highlights the need for culturally and demographically inclusive ASR development for healthcare ecosystem in India.

TL;DR: Benchmarking four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, W2v-BERT) across 13 African languages with varying data amounts reveals their different performance characteristics in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: African languages face limited labeled ASR data and lack systematic guidance on model selection, data scaling, and decoding strategies. While large pre-trained systems exist, their comparative performance in African low-resource contexts hasn't been studied systematically.

Method: Benchmarked four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Analyzed model behavior under varying conditions and evaluated external language model decoding strategies.

Result: MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively with additional data, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. External language model decoding yields improvements in some cases but plateaus or introduces errors depending on acoustic-text resource alignment.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights into ASR system design for underrepresented languages by highlighting interactions between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain, and resource availability. Offers guidance on model selection based on available data resources.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages remains constrained by limited labeled data and the lack of systematic guidance on model selection, data scaling, and decoding strategies. Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources. By highlighting the interaction between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain, and resource availability, this study offers practical and insights into the design of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance large language models' ability to perform complex biomedical QA tasks by developing a specialized retrieval-augmented approach that can efficiently retrieve and rank relevant biomedical documents for precise, context-aware response generation.

Method: Combines semantic and lexical search for document retrieval, followed by supervised fine-tuning. The model retrieves and ranks biomedical documents efficiently to enable precise response generation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of semantic search-based retrieval combined with LLM fine-tuning for biomedical applications, showing significant improvements over existing approaches across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have significantly enhanced the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex question-answering (QA) tasks. In this paper, we introduce MedBioRAG, a retrieval-augmented model designed to improve biomedical QA performance through a combination of semantic and lexical search, document retrieval, and supervised fine-tuning. MedBioRAG efficiently retrieves and ranks relevant biomedical documents, enabling precise and context-aware response generation. We evaluate MedBioRAG across text retrieval, close-ended QA, and long-form QA tasks using benchmark datasets such as NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, MedQA, PubMedQA, and BioASQ. Experimental results demonstrate that MedBioRAG outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models and the GPT-4o base model in all evaluated tasks.

*Xin Sun,Zhongqi Chen,Xing Zheng,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Bowen Song,Zilei Wang,Weiqiang Wang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KBQA-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework for knowledge base question answering that shifts from text imitation to interactive optimization, achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KBQA approaches suffer from two main failures: generating hallucinated queries without verifying schema existence, and rigid template-based reasoning that lacks true comprehension of the knowledge graph environment.

Method: KBQA-R1 treats KBQA as a multi-turn decision process where the model learns to navigate the knowledge base using actions. It uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine strategies based on execution feedback, and introduces Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS) to address cold-start challenges by aligning reasoning traces with ground-truth action sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions demonstrate that KBQA-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively grounding LLM reasoning in verifiable execution.

Conclusion: KBQA-R1 successfully shifts the paradigm from text imitation to interaction optimization via reinforcement learning, addressing the limitations of current approaches and achieving superior performance by grounding LLM reasoning in concrete execution feedback.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) challenges models to bridge the gap between natural language and strict knowledge graph schemas by generating executable logical forms. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced this field, current approaches often struggle with a dichotomy of failure: they either generate hallucinated queries without verifying schema existence or exhibit rigid, template-based reasoning that mimics synthesized traces without true comprehension of the environment. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{KBQA-R1}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from text imitation to interaction optimization via Reinforcement Learning. Treating KBQA as a multi-turn decision process, our model learns to navigate the knowledge base using a list of actions, leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine its strategies based on concrete execution feedback rather than static supervision. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS)}, a data synthesis method that resolves cold-start challenges by strictly aligning reasoning traces with ground-truth action sequences. Extensive experiments on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions demonstrate that KBQA-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively grounding LLM reasoning in verifiable execution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiScript30k extends the Multi30k dataset to include Arabic, Spanish, Ukrainian, and Chinese (Simplified/Traditional) translations, addressing the limitation of original Multi30k's European language focus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original Multi30k dataset only covers four European languages (Czech, English, French, German), limiting multimodal machine translation research to Latin-script European languages and stalling progress on diverse language families and scripts.

Method: Created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B model, producing over 30,000 sentences translated into Arabic, Spanish, Ukrainian, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese.

Result: Similarity analysis shows >0.8 cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence <0.000251 for most languages (except Traditional Chinese comparable to previous extensions). COMETKiwi scores show mixed performance: Arabic translation comparable to ArEnMulti30k, but Ukrainian translation 6.4% lower than Multi30k-Uk.

Conclusion: MultiScript30k successfully extends multimodal translation resources to diverse scripts and language families, though translation quality varies compared to existing specialized extensions, providing valuable data for broader MMT research.

Abstract: Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \(30000\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\_Hans and Zh\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \(0.8\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \(0.000251\) for all languages supported except Zh\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work. ArEnMulti30k scores nearly equal MultiScript30k-Ar, but Multi30k-Uk scores $6.4\%$ greater than MultiScript30k-Uk per split.

*Alan Gerber,Sam Cooperman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an iMessage analyzer tool to extract insights from locally stored iMessage data, answering research questions about topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As society increasingly relies on short-form electronic communication, it's important to understand what messaging data can reveal about users. Apple provides a locally stored file containing iMessage data on Mac, creating an opportunity to analyze personal messaging patterns that are typically inaccessible in other platforms.

Method: The researchers created an iMessage text message analyzer tool that extracts and analyzes data from the locally stored iMessage database file on Mac computers. The tool enables analysis of message content and metadata to answer specific research questions.

Result: The paper demonstrates how the analyzer can answer five main research questions: topic modeling (identifying conversation themes), response times (analyzing reply patterns), reluctance scoring (measuring engagement levels), and sentiment analysis (assessing emotional tone).

Conclusion: The iMessage analyzer successfully extracts valuable insights from locally stored messaging data and shows potential for future studies on iMessage data, enabling users to better understand their own communication patterns and providing a tool for researchers.

Abstract: What is your messaging data used for? While many users do not often think about the information companies can gather based off of their messaging platform of choice, it is nonetheless important to consider as society increasingly relies on short-form electronic communication. While most companies keep their data closely guarded, inaccessible to users or potential hackers, Apple has opened a door to their walled-garden ecosystem, providing iMessage users on Mac with one file storing all their messages and attached metadata. With knowledge of this locally stored file, the question now becomes: What can our data do for us? In the creation of our iMessage text message analyzer, we set out to answer five main research questions focusing on topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis. This paper uses our exploratory data to show how these questions can be answered using our analyzer and its potential in future studies on iMessage data.

### [93] [Explanation Bias is a Product: Revealing the Hidden Lexical and Position Preferences in Post-Hoc Feature Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11108)
*Jonathan Kamp,Roos Bakker,Dominique Blok*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes biases in feature attribution methods for language model explanations, proposing a framework to evaluate lexical and position biases across different methods and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature attribution methods provide token-level insights but produce inconsistent explanations due to underlying biases, leading to user mistrust or inappropriate trust in their utility.

Method: Developed a model- and method-agnostic framework with three evaluation metrics to systematically assess lexical and position biases. Tested on two transformers: first with controlled pseudo-random classification on artificial data, then with semi-controlled causal relation detection on natural data.

Result: Found that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in model comparison - models scoring high on one type score low on the other. Methods producing anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased themselves.

Conclusion: The framework reveals systematic biases in attribution methods, showing trade-offs between lexical and position biases, and suggests that anomalous explanations may indicate underlying method biases.

Abstract: Good quality explanations strengthen the understanding of language models and data. Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both the lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other. We also find signs that methods producing anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased themselves.

*Evren Ayberk Munis,Deniz Yılmaz,Arianna Muti,Çağrı Toraman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FIBER is a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in LLMs across single- and multi-entity settings in English, Italian, and Turkish, revealing language-dependent inference biases and performance differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating factual knowledge in LLMs are limited to single-entity facts and monolingual data, creating a need for comprehensive multilingual evaluation tools that can assess both single- and multi-entity factual knowledge across different languages.

Method: Created FIBER benchmark with sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Used this benchmark to examine prompt language effects on entity selection bias and compare performance on multi-entity vs single-entity questions across different model sizes.

Result: Prompt language influences model output, especially for entities associated with countries corresponding to that language (31% of topics show bias >0.5). Turkish prompts show higher bias than Italian in 83% of topics. Models struggle more with multi-entity than single-entity questions. English achieves highest performance, while Turkish and Italian have lower scores. Larger models (Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-7B) outperform smaller 3B-4B models.

Conclusion: FIBER reveals significant language-dependent biases in LLMs' factual knowledge and highlights challenges with multi-entity reasoning. The benchmark provides a valuable tool for comprehensive multilingual evaluation of factual knowledge, showing that both language and model size significantly impact factual reliability.

Abstract: Large language models are widely used across domains, yet there are concerns about their factual reliability and biases. Factual knowledge probing offers a systematic means to evaluate these aspects. Most existing benchmarks focus on single-entity facts and monolingual data. We therefore present FIBER, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in single- and multi-entity settings. The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores. Larger models, including Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, show consistently better performance than smaller 3B-4B models.

Abstract: Multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU) involves two tasks: multiple intent detection and slot filling, which jointly handle utterances containing more than one intent. Owing to this characteristic, which closely reflects real-world applications, the task has attracted increasing research attention, and substantial progress has been achieved. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review of existing studies on multi-intent SLU. To this end, this paper presents a survey of recent advances in multi-intent SLU. We provide an in-depth overview of previous research from two perspectives: decoding paradigms and modeling approaches. On this basis, we further compare the performance of representative models and analyze their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and outline promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will offer valuable insights and serve as a useful reference for advancing research in multi-intent SLU.

*Yun-Chung Liu,Rui Yang,Jonathan Chong Kai Liew,Ziran Yin,Henry Foote,Christopher J. Lindsell,Chuan Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage dynamic few-shot learning approach using LLMs to improve efficiency and performance in systematic review title/abstract screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic reviews are crucial for evidence-based medicine but title/abstract screening has become increasingly time-consuming and resource-intensive due to rapid growth of research publications.

Method: Two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach: first uses low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances with high-performance LLM to balance performance and computational costs.

Result: Evaluated across 10 systematic reviews, demonstrating strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate systematic review process.

Conclusion: The DFSL approach effectively improves efficiency and performance of LLMs in systematic review screening, offering practical benefits for evidence synthesis workflows.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are a key component of evidence-based medicine, playing a critical role in synthesizing existing research evidence and guiding clinical decisions. However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.

*Mrinal Rawat,Arkajyoti Chakraborty,Neha Gupta,Roberto Pieraccini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-based approach improves reasoning and tool use in LLMs by learning from task outcomes, outperforming SFT models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT struggles with generalization when data distribution changes, and collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT is costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. Reasoning-focused models show better generalization but need scalable training methods.

Method: Proposes RL pipeline where LLMs generate reasoning steps to guide tool invocation and answer generation. Uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards based on tool accuracy and answer correctness to iteratively refine reasoning and actions.

Result: Achieves 1.5% relative improvement over SFT model (without explicit thinking) and 40% gain compared to base Qwen3-1.7B model. Improves both reasoning quality and tool invocation precision.

Conclusion: RL can effectively unify reasoning and action learning to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents, addressing SFT limitations in generalization and reasoning trace collection.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.

### [99] [AdaSD: Adaptive Speculative Decoding for Efficient Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11280)
*Kuan-Wei Lu,Ding-Yong Hong,Pangfeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSD is a hyperparameter-free speculative decoding method that dynamically adjusts generation length and token acceptance during inference using adaptive thresholds based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance, achieving up to 49% speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have high inference latency due to large parameter sizes. Existing speculative decoding methods require additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis before deployment, limiting their practicality.

Method: AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one for stopping candidate token generation and another for token acceptance. Both thresholds are updated in real-time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance between draft and target model distributions.

Result: AdaSD achieves up to 49% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2% on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: AdaSD provides a practical, hyperparameter-free solution for efficient LLM inference that works with off-the-shelf models without requiring pre-analysis or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their increasing parameter sizes significantly slow down inference. Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49\% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2\%, making it a practical solution for efficient and adaptive LLM inference.

### [100] [CIP: A Plug-and-Play Causal Prompting Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations under Long-Context Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11282)
*Qingsen Ma,Dianyun Wang,Ran Jing,Yujun Sun,Zhenbo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIP is a lightweight causal prompting framework that reduces hallucinations in LLMs by constructing causal relation sequences to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence, improving factual grounding and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often hallucinate when processing long and noisy retrieval contexts because they rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships. This leads to unreliable outputs and poor factual grounding.

Method: CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. It uses causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning to suppress non-causal reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments across seven mainstream language models show CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability: 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, fourfold increase in effective information density, and up to 55.1% reduction in end-to-end response latency.

Conclusion: Causal reasoning may serve as a promising paradigm for improving the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models, with CIP demonstrating significant improvements in factual grounding and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate when processing long and noisy retrieval contexts because they rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships. We propose CIP, a lightweight and plug-and-play causal prompting framework that mitigates hallucinations at the input stage. CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density. API level profiling further shows that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces end to end response latency by up to 55.1 percent. These results suggest that causal reasoning may serve as a promising paradigm for improving the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models.

TL;DR: qa-FLoRA is a query-adaptive, training-free method for dynamically fusing LoRA adapters using distributional divergence between base model and adapters, eliminating need for composite training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods either use static weights (equal relevance) or require data-intensive supervised training for every LoRA combination, making them inefficient for handling complex multi-domain queries.

Method: Proposes qa-FLoRA that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between base model and respective adapters, without requiring training data or domain samples.

Result: Outperforms static fusion by ~5-6% and training-free baselines by ~7-10% across nine multilingual composite tasks in mathematics, coding, and medical domains, while closing gap with supervised baselines.

Conclusion: qa-FLoRA provides an effective, interpretable, and readily applicable solution for robust multi-domain adaptation of LLMs through query-adaptive LoRA fusion without training data requirements.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models for specialized tasks often requires domain-specific parameter-efficient finetuning through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze judicial reasoning at scale and refute claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe by developing automated methods for detecting and classifying judicial reasoning.

Method: Created MADON dataset of 272 Czech Supreme Court decisions with expert annotations; adapted transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain via continued pretraining; used asymmetric loss and class weighting for dataset imbalance; developed three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based ML.

Result: Best models achieved 82.6% macro-F1 for detecting argumentative paragraphs, 77.5% macro-F1 for classifying legal argument types, and 83.2% macro-F1 for classifying decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic.

Conclusion: Legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification, challenges prevailing narratives about CEE formalism, and shows potential for computational legal studies; methodology is replicable across jurisdictions with all resources publicly available.

Abstract: Courts must justify their decisions, but systematically analyzing judicial reasoning at scale remains difficult. This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability. Empirically, we challenge prevailing narratives about CEE formalism. This work shows that legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification and shows the potential of legal argument mining for other important tasks in computational legal studies. Our methodology is easily replicable across jurisdictions, and our entire pipeline, datasets, guidelines, models, and source codes are available at https://github.com/trusthlt/madon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different data selection strategies affect fine-tuning performance in machine translation tasks for open large language models, particularly examining the sensitivity of models to data quality during fine-tuning.

Method: Used Japanese-English translation corpora to compare five data selection methods: TF-IDF (lexical), COMET Kiwi (semantic), QuRate (semantic), FD-Score (geometry-based), and random selection, under controlled training conditions.

Result: Semantic selectors (COMET Kiwi, QuRate) consistently outperformed lexical (TF-IDF) and geometry-based (FD-Score) heuristics. Even when selected data differed by less than 3%, the impact on model performance was substantial, demonstrating high sensitivity to data quality.

Conclusion: Data selection strategy is crucial for machine translation fine-tuning, with semantic-based methods providing superior performance. The findings highlight the extreme sensitivity of LLM fine-tuning to data quality, where even minor differences in selected data can lead to significant performance variations.

Abstract: We investigated the impact of data selection on machine translation fine-tuning for open LLMs. Using Japanese-English corpora, we compare five selectors: TF-IDF, COMET Kiwi, QuRate, FD-Score, and random selection, under controlled training conditions.

TL;DR: A clip selection method for video summarization that uses lightweight video captioning and LLM selection to identify key moments, achieving near-reference performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with long videos where important visual information gets lost, and there's a need for cost-effective tools to analyze lengthy video content.

Method: Divide video into short clips, generate compact visual descriptions using lightweight video captioning model, then use LLM to select K most relevant clips for multimodal summary.

Result: Achieves summarization performance close to reference clips (less than 6% of movie), captures substantially more relevant video information than random selection, maintains low computational cost.

Conclusion: Proposed clip selection method effectively identifies key video moments for multimodal summaries while being computationally efficient, addressing challenges of information loss in long videos.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.

TL;DR: CLINIC is a comprehensive multilingual benchmark that evaluates language model trustworthiness in healthcare across 5 dimensions (truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, privacy) through 18 tasks spanning 15 languages, revealing significant shortcomings in factual correctness, bias, and security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language models are predominantly trained in high-resource languages and lack reliable evaluation of trustworthiness in multilingual healthcare settings, creating barriers to real-world adoption in global healthcare contexts with linguistic diversity.

Method: Developed CLINIC benchmark that systematically evaluates language models across five trustworthiness dimensions: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy. Operationalized through 18 diverse tasks spanning 15 languages covering major continents, addressing critical healthcare topics like diseases, prevention, diagnostics, treatments, surgeries, and medications.

Result: Extensive evaluation reveals that language models struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: CLINIC highlights critical shortcomings in language model trustworthiness for healthcare applications and lays the foundation for enhancing global reach and safety of language models across diverse languages in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Integrating language models (LMs) in healthcare systems holds great promise for improving medical workflows and decision-making. However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable construction of patient journeys by extracting structured clinical timelines from electronic health records in Hebrew, addressing the need for medical language processing in Hebrew while maintaining privacy through de-identification.

Method: Based on DictaBERT 2.0 architecture with continual pre-training on over 5 million de-identified hospital records. Introduced two new datasets for evaluation: one from internal medicine/emergency departments and another from oncology, both annotated for event temporal relations. Used vocabulary adaptation for token efficiency.

Result: The model achieves strong performance on both new temporal relation datasets. Vocabulary adaptation improves token efficiency. De-identification does not compromise downstream performance, supporting privacy-conscious model development.

Conclusion: The Hebrew medical language model successfully extracts structured clinical timelines for patient journey construction, demonstrates that de-identification maintains performance, and is made available for research use under ethical restrictions.

Abstract: We present a new Hebrew medical language model designed to extract structured clinical timelines from electronic health records, enabling the construction of patient journeys. Our model is based on DictaBERT 2.0 and continually pre-trained on over five million de-identified hospital records. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce two new datasets -- one from internal medicine and emergency departments, and another from oncology -- annotated for event temporal relations. Our results show that our model achieves strong performance on both datasets. We also find that vocabulary adaptation improves token efficiency and that de-identification does not compromise downstream performance, supporting privacy-conscious model development. The model is made available for research use under ethical restrictions.

*Mohor Banerjee,Nadya Yuki Wangsajaya,Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff,Min Sen Tan,Zachary Choy Kit Chun,Alvin Chan Guo Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hallucination-reduction methods (CoVe, DoLa, RAG) have opposing effects on LLM creativity: CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG has minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many methods reduce LLM hallucinations, their impact on creative generation remains unexplored, creating a critical gap for AI-assisted scientific discovery which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation.

Method: Investigated three hallucination-reduction techniques (Chain of Verification, Decoding by Contrasting Layers, Retrieval-Augmented Generation) across multiple LLM families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B-70B parameters) using two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4).

Result: Methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity: CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact.

Conclusion: Findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications where balancing factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.

### [109] [Visualizing token importance for black-box language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11573)
*Paulius Rauba,Qiyao Wei,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DBSA is a model-agnostic method for auditing black-box LLMs by analyzing output sensitivity to each input token without distributional assumptions, enabling practical visual exploration of token dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for auditing tools for black-box LLMs in high-stakes domains (legal, medical, compliance) where existing methods focus on isolated aspects like bias detection. The challenge is understanding how outputs depend on each input token when dealing with stochastic LLMs and inaccessible API endpoints.

Method: Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA) - a lightweight, model-agnostic procedure that evaluates output sensitivity for each input token without making distributional assumptions about the LLM. It's designed as a plug-and-play tool for practitioners.

Result: DBSA enables quick visual exploration of LLM reliance on specific input tokens and can identify sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing interpretability methods, as demonstrated through illustrative examples.

Conclusion: DBSA provides a practical solution for auditing black-box LLMs by analyzing token-level sensitivities, addressing the need for comprehensive understanding of model behavior in real-world applications with inaccessible API endpoints.

Abstract: We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.

### [110] [Bounding Hallucinations: Information-Theoretic Guarantees for RAG Systems via Merlin-Arthur Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11614)
*Björn Deiseroth,Max Henning Höth,Kristian Kersting,Letitia Parcalabescu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training framework treats RAG as an interactive proof system using Merlin-Arthur protocol to improve evidence grounding and reduce hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems treat retrieval as weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence, leading to unsupported answers, hallucinations, and reliance on spurious evidence.

Method: Adapts Merlin-Arthur protocol: Arthur (generator LLM) trains on questions with Merlin providing helpful evidence and Morgana injecting adversarial context, using XAI to identify influential evidence.

Result: M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, reject behavior, and reduced hallucinations across three RAG datasets and two model families.

Conclusion: Autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides principled path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents as verifiable evidence rather than suggestions.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.

*Keerthana Murugaraj,Salima Lamsiyah,Marten During,Martin Theobald*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper applies BERTopic, a neural topic modeling approach using transformer embeddings, to analyze historical newspaper discourse on nuclear power and safety from 1955-2018, overcoming limitations of traditional methods like LDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling methods like LDA struggle with historical newspaper archives due to topic evolution, OCR noise, and large text volumes, failing to capture the complexity and dynamic nature of historical discourse.

Method: The study employs BERTopic, a neural topic modeling approach that leverages transformer-based embeddings to extract and classify topics from historical newspaper articles (1955-2018) about nuclear power and safety.

Result: The approach successfully analyzes topic distributions and traces their temporal evolution, revealing long-term trends and shifts in public discourse, including co-occurrence of nuclear power and weapons themes and their changing importance over time.

Conclusion: BERTopic demonstrates scalability and contextual sensitivity as an alternative to traditional methods, offering richer insights into historical discourses from newspaper archives, with contributions to historical, nuclear, and social science research.

Abstract: Extracting coherent and human-understandable themes from large collections of unstructured historical newspaper archives presents significant challenges due to topic evolution, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) noise, and the sheer volume of text. Traditional topic-modeling methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often fall short in capturing the complexity and dynamic nature of discourse in historical texts. To address these limitations, we employ BERTopic. This neural topic-modeling approach leverages transformerbased embeddings to extract and classify topics, which, despite its growing popularity, still remains underused in historical research. Our study focuses on articles published between 1955 and 2018, specifically examining discourse on nuclear power and nuclear safety. We analyze various topic distributions across the corpus and trace their temporal evolution to uncover long-term trends and shifts in public discourse. This enables us to more accurately explore patterns in public discourse, including the co-occurrence of themes related to nuclear power and nuclear weapons and their shifts in topic importance over time. Our study demonstrates the scalability and contextual sensitivity of BERTopic as an alternative to traditional approaches, offering richer insights into historical discourses extracted from newspaper archives. These findings contribute to historical, nuclear, and social-science research while reflecting on current limitations and proposing potential directions for future work.

*Sergey Pankratov,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper establishes tight lower bounds on runtime for deterministic speculative generation in LLMs by modeling token generation as branching random walks, proving theoretical limits on parallel token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speculative generation accelerates LLM inference through parallel verification of draft tokens, but fundamental limits on achievable speedup remain poorly understood, motivating theoretical analysis of these bounds.

Method: Draws parallel between token generation and branching random walks to analyze optimal draft tree selection, proving mathematical bounds on expected tokens predicted per speculative iteration under basic assumptions.

Result: Proves that expected number of successfully predicted tokens per iteration is bounded by (μ + μ₂)log(P)/μ² + O(1), where P is verifier capacity, μ is expected entropy, and μ₂ is expected second log-moment.

Conclusion: Provides first tight lower bounds on speculative generation runtime, offers insights into parallel token generation limits, guides future speculative decoding system design, with empirical validation on Llama models confirming theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Speculative generation has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging parallelism to verify multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\mathbb{E}[X] \leq (μ+ μ_{(2)})\log(P )/μ^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $μ$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $μ_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment. This result provides new insights into the limits of parallel token generation, and could guide the design of future speculative decoding systems. Empirical evaluations on Llama models validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the tightness of our bounds in practical settings.

TL;DR: SUMFORU is a steerable review summarization framework that aligns summaries with user personas for personalized purchase decisions, outperforming generic LLM summarizers through persona-aware fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online product reviews contain rich but noisy information that overwhelms users, and existing LLM-based summarizers are too generic and don't account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility for personalized decision-making.

Method: SUMFORU integrates a high-quality data pipeline from Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals.

Result: The framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings (rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics), demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment, and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories.

Conclusion: The results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems that can effectively account for individual user preferences in review summarization.

Abstract: Online product reviews contain rich but noisy signals that overwhelm users and hinder effective decision-making.

Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories.

### [114] [CORL: Reinforcement Learning of MILP Policies Solved via Branch and Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11169)
*Akhil S Anand,Elias Aarekol,Martin Mziray Dalseg,Magnus Stalhane,Sebastien Gros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORL framework uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune MILP schemes end-to-end for better real-world operational performance, treating MILP solving as a differentiable stochastic policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MILP models for combinatorial sequential decision making often fail in real-world performance due to inaccurate modeling of stochastic problems. Existing machine learning approaches rely on supervised learning with optimal decisions and surrogate gradients.

Method: CORL framework casts MILP solved by branch-and-bound as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL, enabling end-to-end fine-tuning on real-world data to maximize operational performance.

Result: Validated in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example as a proof of concept.

Conclusion: The CORL framework demonstrates a novel approach to improve MILP performance in real-world applications by using reinforcement learning for end-to-end optimization rather than relying on supervised learning with optimal solutions.

Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.

### [115] [Deep Learning--Accelerated Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search for Real-time Freight Bundling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11187)
*Haohui Zhang,Wouter van Heeswijk,Xinyu Hu,Neil Yorke-Smith,Martijn Mes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid learning-search pipeline combining Transformer-based constructive policy with Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search solves the combinatorial bundling problem in online freight exchanges with <2% optimality gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online Freight Exchange Systems need efficient combinatorial bundling of transportation jobs, but current methods struggle with coupling bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency requirements.

Method: Model the problem as multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP). Propose a learning-accelerated hybrid search pipeline: Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy paired with Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search metaheuristic within rolling-horizon scheme.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving <2% optimality gap in total revenue relative to best exact baseline method.

Conclusion: First work to show Deep Neural Network-based constructors can reliably provide high-quality seeds for multi-start improvement heuristics, with broad applicability beyond m1-PDSTSP to selective traveling salesperson and pickup/delivery problems.

Abstract: Online Freight Exchange Systems (OFEX) play a crucial role in modern freight logistics by facilitating real-time matching between shippers and carrier. However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish that a Deep Neural Network-based constructor can reliably provide high-quality seeds for (multi-start) improvement heuristics, with applicability beyond the \textit{m1-PDSTSP} to a broad class of selective traveling salesperson problems and pickup and delivery problems.

*Dongwon Jung,Peng Shi,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FutureWeaver is a framework for optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets, using modularized collaboration and dual-level planning to enhance performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While test-time computation scaling improves LLM performance, existing techniques don't work well in multi-agent systems - there are no principled mechanisms to allocate compute for collaboration, extend test-time scaling to multi-agent interactions, or distribute compute under budget constraints.

Method: FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration as callable functions encapsulating reusable multi-agent workflows, automatically derived through self-play reflection. It uses a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over current task state while speculating on future steps.

Result: Experiments on complex agent benchmarks show FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

Conclusion: FutureWeaver successfully addresses the gap in test-time compute allocation for multi-agent systems, providing a principled framework that enables effective collaboration and optimization under budget constraints.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A-LAMP is an LLM-based framework that automatically converts natural language task descriptions into MDP formulations and trained RL policies through verifiable stages, outperforming single LLMs and maintaining task optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying RL to real-world tasks requires manual conversion of informal descriptions to formal MDPs, environment implementation, and policy training, which is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives that impede training.

Method: Introduces A-LAMP, an agentic LLM-based framework that decomposes the process into verifiable stages: MDP modeling, coding, and training, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline.

Result: A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than single state-of-the-art LLMs across classic control and custom RL domains. Even lightweight variants built on smaller models approach performance of much larger models.

Conclusion: A-LAMP successfully automates RL task formulation and policy generation while preserving task optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability for real-world RL applications.

Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world tasks requires converting informal descriptions into a formal Markov decision process (MDP), implementing an executable environment, and training a policy agent. Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based trip planning agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans that don't meet real-world requirements.

Method: TriFlow uses a progressive three-stage pipeline: retrieval, planning, and governance. It employs rule-LLM collaboration to assemble constraint-consistent itineraries and performs bounded iterative refinement for global feasibility and personalization.

Result: Achieved 91.1% final pass rate on TravelPlanner benchmark and 97% on TripTailor benchmark, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TriFlow successfully addresses limitations of existing LLM-based trip planning agents by unifying structured reasoning with language flexibility, demonstrating superior constraint satisfaction and efficiency in real-world trip planning scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.

TL;DR: CAPTURE is a comprehensive CAPTCHA benchmark for Large Visual Language Models covering 4 main types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors, revealing poor LVLM performance on CAPTCHA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAPTCHA benchmarks are limited and customized for specific research objectives, lacking comprehensive coverage of CAPTCHA types and dedicated evaluation for LVLMs.

Method: Introduced CAPTURE benchmark with extensive class variety, large-scale data, and LVLM-tailored labels covering 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors.

Result: Current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs when evaluated by this comprehensive benchmark.

Conclusion: CAPTURE fills gaps in previous research by providing comprehensive data and LVLM-specific evaluation, highlighting LVLMs' limitations in CAPTCHA solving despite their strong multi-modal capabilities.

Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.

TL;DR: A framework for LLM-based agents that provides explicit behavioral guidance in RL environments through task profiling, verifiable reasoning, and constraint-compliant generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models show strong reasoning abilities but lack reliability and verifiability in multi-turn tasks, especially when interacting with environments.

Method: Three-component framework: 1) lightweight task profiler selects reasoning/generation strategies, 2) reasoning module learns verifiable observation-action mappings, 3) generation module enforces constraint-compliant outputs via validation or deterministic synthesis.

Result: The components co-evolve as the agent interacts with the environment, yielding trustworthy behavior in RL environments with defined observation, action, and reward signals.

Conclusion: The framework enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance, improving reliability and verifiability in multi-turn tasks within structured environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.

*Shuowei Cai,Yansong Ning,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentBalance is a framework for constructing cost-effective multi-agent systems under explicit token-cost and latency budgets using a backbone-then-topology design approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based multi-agent systems focus on communication topologies and agent backbones but rarely optimize under explicit token-cost and latency budgets, leading to suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding constraints for large-scale deployment.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Backbone-oriented agent generation with LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching; 2) Adaptive MAS topology generation with agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis.

Result: Achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets respectively, with strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks using 14 candidate LLM backbones.

Conclusion: AgentBalance enables practical, budget-aware deployment of multi-agent systems, functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, and generalizes well to unseen LLMs for cost-effective web-scale applications.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

### [122] [Back to the Baseline: Examining Baseline Effects on Explainability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11433)
*Agustin Martin Picard,Thibaut Boissin,Varshini Subhash,Rémi Cadène,Thomas Fel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a critical flaw in popular XAI fidelity metrics (Insertion/Deletion) - baseline choice biases evaluation results, and proposes a new model-dependent baseline that better removes information without creating out-of-distribution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI evaluation using Insertion and Deletion metrics suffers from baseline selection bias, where different baselines favor different attribution methods, leading to contradictory results about which method is optimal.

Method: The authors analyze baseline properties (information removal and OOD avoidance), test existing baselines, and introduce a novel model-dependent baseline using feature visualization techniques to create a baseline that removes information without producing overly OOD images.

Result: Existing baselines show a trade-off: they either remove information well but produce OOD images, or avoid OOD issues but fail to remove information effectively. The proposed baseline improves this trade-off compared to existing alternatives.

Conclusion: Baseline choice significantly impacts XAI evaluation, and the proposed model-dependent baseline offers a better solution by balancing information removal with OOD avoidance, providing more reliable attribution method comparisons.

Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

*Pranav Ramanathan,Thomas Prellberg,Matthew Lewis,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First systematic comparison of classical optimization (ILP) vs AI methods (PatternBoost transformer and PPO reinforcement learning) for the No-Three-In-Line problem, showing ILP optimal up to 19×19 grids while AI methods are competitive on smaller instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The No-Three-In-Line problem is a famous combinatorial geometry challenge where classical methods like ILP guarantee optimal solutions but face exponential scaling with grid size, while recent AI advances offer promising pattern-based approximations that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Applied PatternBoost transformer learning and PPO reinforcement learning to the No-Three-In-Line problem for the first time, comparing them against traditional Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization methods.

Result: ILP achieved provably optimal solutions up to 19×19 grids. PatternBoost matched optimal performance up to 14×14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieved perfect solutions on 10×10 grids but failed at 11×11 due to constraint violations.

Conclusion: Classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

*Kris A. G. Wyckhuys*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSeek outperforms ChatGPT in agroecological crop protection knowledge generation, showing larger literature coverage, more solutions, and higher accuracy, but both models have hallucination issues requiring human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of generative AI in agri-food science, specifically assessing how well large language models can generate accurate scientific knowledge about agroecological crop protection for globally limiting pests, weeds, and diseases.

Method: Compared two LLMs (DeepSeek vs. free-tier ChatGPT) on nine globally limiting agricultural problems. Assessed factual accuracy, data consistency, and knowledge breadth/completeness. Evaluated literature corpus size, biological control agents reported, efficacy estimates, and laboratory-to-field data consistency.

Result: DeepSeek consistently outperformed ChatGPT: screened 4.8-49.7× larger literature, reported 1.6-2.4× more biological control agents/solutions, showed 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, better lab-field consistency, and more realistic effects. Both models hallucinated (fabricated references/agents), reported implausible ecological interactions, confused nomenclatures, and omitted key data, but correctly identified low-resolution efficacy trends.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for agroecological knowledge generation with DeepSeek outperforming ChatGPT, both require rigorous human oversight due to hallucination issues. When properly supervised, they could become powerful tools for farm-level decision-making and scientific creativity in agri-food systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BAID is a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI text detectors that systematically assesses bias across 7 sociolinguistic categories using 200k+ samples, revealing consistent performance disparities against underrepresented groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI text detectors lack systematic evaluation across broader sociolinguistic factors, with only isolated cases of bias documented (particularly against English Language Learners). There's a need for comprehensive bias assessment before deployment in educational and professional contexts.

Method: Developed BAID framework with 200k+ samples spanning 7 bias categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. Created synthetic versions of each sample using carefully crafted prompts to preserve content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Evaluated 4 open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors using this dataset.

Result: Found consistent disparities in detection performance across all evaluated detectors, with particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. The framework revealed systematic bias patterns that weren't apparent in isolated evaluations.

Conclusion: BAID provides a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasizes the critical need for bias-aware evaluation before deploying these tools for public use. The systematic framework reveals hidden biases that could disproportionately impact marginalized groups.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.

Conclusion: EmeraldMind provides an effective framework for automated greenwashing detection that offers transparent, evidence-based assessments and responsibly abstains when claims cannot be verified, addressing a critical need in sustainability-focused AI systems.

Abstract: As AI and web agents become pervasive in decision-making, it is critical to design intelligent systems that not only support sustainability efforts but also guard against misinformation. Greenwashing, i.e., misleading corporate sustainability claims, poses a major challenge to environmental progress. To address this challenge, we introduce EmeraldMind, a fact-centric framework integrating a domain-specific knowledge graph with retrieval-augmented generation to automate greenwashing detection. EmeraldMind builds the EmeraldGraph from diverse corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reports, surfacing verifiable evidence, often missing in generic knowledge bases, and supporting large language models in claim assessment. The framework delivers justification-centric classifications, presenting transparent, evidence-backed verdicts and abstaining responsibly when claims cannot be verified. Experiments on a new greenwashing claims dataset demonstrate that EmeraldMind achieves competitive accuracy, greater coverage, and superior explanation quality compared to generic LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.

*Yuan Shen,Xiaojun Wu,Linghua Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show functional decline in extracting medical info from noisy clinical data, similar to metabolic dysfunction, with Qwen3-Max performing best and GPT-4o making serious PE risk misjudgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to extract core medical information from noisy patient complaints and verify if they exhibit functional decline analogous to MASLD in clinical scenarios.

Method: Cross-sectional analysis using 20 standardized medical probes across 5 dimensions with 4 LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, Qwen3-Max), assessed via double-blind inverse rating by clinicians against gold-standard answers.

Result: All models showed functional defects, with Qwen3-Max best overall and Gemini 2.5 worst. Most models collapsed under extreme noise. GPT-4o made severe misjudgment in PE risk assessment secondary to DVT.

Conclusion: First empirical confirmation of LLMs exhibiting metabolic dysfunction-like features when processing clinical info, proposing "AI-MASLD" concept. LLMs need human supervision as auxiliary tools due to significant gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI benchmarks are static and easily memorized by large language models, creating a disconnect between benchmark results and real-world performance. Rapid evolution in models, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target that traditional benchmarks cannot address.

Method: The paper proposes a shift from static benchmarks to continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks that incorporate evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms. It introduces the concept of "AI Benchmark Carpentry" - systematic education and training programs to develop expertise in benchmark design and use, based on experiences from MLCommons, educational initiatives, and DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium.

Result: The analysis identifies key barriers: high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware but offer limited guidance for diverse real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Benchmarking must become dynamic, transparent, reproducible, and interpretable to keep pace with AI evolution. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels. Community efforts should support application-relevant comparisons for informed, context-sensitive decisions, ensuring responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment.

Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.

*Chutian Ma,Grigorii Pomazkin,Giacinto Paolo Saggese,Paul Smith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A structural causal model for energy demand prediction that incorporates weather and calendar factors, revealing season-dependent temperature sensitivity and winter variance patterns, with a Bayesian model achieving state-of-the-art 3.84% MAPE performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operations and industrial consumers, but existing correlation-based methods fail to capture the complex causal interdependencies between weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) and calendar information that affect daily schedules.

Method: Proposed a structural causal model to explain causal relationships between variables, performed full causal analysis to validate beliefs, then built a Bayesian model that incorporates learned causal insights as prior knowledge.

Result: The causal model revealed important insights: energy demand responds to temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity, and exhibits lower variance in winter due to decoupling between temperature changes and activity patterns. The Bayesian model achieved state-of-the-art 3.84% MAPE on test data and demonstrated strong robustness with 3.88% average MAPE in cross-validation across two years.

Conclusion: The structural causal modeling approach successfully captures complex causal relationships in energy demand prediction, leading to improved predictive performance and robustness compared to correlation-based methods, with practical implications for grid management and energy planning.

Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.

TL;DR: TxAgent is an AI system for therapeutic decision-making that uses iterative RAG with a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model and a biomedical tool suite, evaluated in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge where it won the Excellence Award in Open Science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Therapeutic decision-making requires robust multi-step reasoning with reliable biomedical knowledge, but general-purpose RAG systems lack the safety constraints needed for medical applications where both reasoning trace and tool invocation accuracy are critical.

Method: TxAgent uses a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model with iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse) integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources.

Result: The system was evaluated in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge using metrics assessing correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality, demonstrating performance gains through improved tool-retrieval strategies and winning the Excellence Award in Open Science.

Conclusion: TxAgent addresses therapeutic reasoning challenges through agentic AI methods with iterative RAG and specialized biomedical tools, showing that retrieval quality for function calls significantly influences overall model performance in high-stakes medical applications.

Abstract: Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/.
