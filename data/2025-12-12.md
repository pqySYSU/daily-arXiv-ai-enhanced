### [1] [Neuromorphic Eye Tracking for Low-Latency Pupil Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09969)
*Paul Hueber,Luca Peres,Florian Pitters,Alejandro Gloriani,Oliver Rhodes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a neuromorphic SNN approach for event-based eye tracking that achieves 3.7-4.1px mean error while reducing model size by 20x and compute by 850x compared to ANN variants, enabling 3.9-4.9 mW power consumption with 3 ms latency for wearable AR/VR applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional frame-based eye tracking pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution, which are critical for seamless AR/VR interactions. While neuromorphic sensors and SNNs offer promise, existing approaches are too specialized or underperform compared to modern ANNs.

Method: The authors create neuromorphic versions of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models by replacing recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity.

Result: The SNN models achieve 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the specialized Retina system (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x compared to the closest ANN variant. The efficient variants are projected to operate at 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz.

Conclusion: High-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be successfully redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains while maintaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment in AR/VR applications.

Abstract: Eye tracking for wearable systems demands low latency and milliwatt-level power, but conventional frame-based pipelines struggle with motion blur, high compute cost, and limited temporal resolution. Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.

### [2] [ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031)
*Woojin Lee,Hyugjae Chang,Jaeho Moon,Jaehyup Lee,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABBSPO is a weakly supervised oriented object detection framework that improves scale estimation through adaptive bounding box scaling and uses symmetry priors for better orientation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HBox-supervised OOD methods have limitations in scale estimation when comparing GT HBoxes directly with predicted RBox circumscribed rectangles, and orientation prediction can collapse when all augmented view predictions are incorrect.

Method: Proposes two key components: 1) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) to appropriately scale GT HBoxes for better RBox size prediction, and 2) Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits aerial object symmetry for self-supervised learning to prevent learning collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments show ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing weakly supervised oriented object detection methods.

Conclusion: ABBSPO effectively addresses scale estimation and orientation prediction issues in HBox-supervised OOD, providing an efficient and accurate weakly supervised solution for oriented object detection.

Abstract: Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

### [3] [Diffusion Is Your Friend in Show, Suggest and Tell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10038)
*Jia Cheng Hu,Roberto Cavicchioli,Alessandro Capotondi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SST combines diffusion models with autoregressive generation for image captioning, using diffusion to provide suggestions to autoregressive models, achieving SOTA results on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown strong results in computer vision but haven't outperformed autoregressive models in discrete domains like language generation. The authors propose combining both approaches to leverage diffusion's bidirectional/refining capabilities with autoregressive models' strong linguistic structure.

Method: Show, Suggest and Tell (SST) uses diffusion models to provide suggestions to autoregressive generation rather than replacing it. The diffusion model offers bidirectional and refining capabilities while the autoregressive model maintains linguistic structure.

Result: SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on COCO without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model SOTA results by 1.5 and 2.5 points respectively. Extensive experiments show positive correlation between suggestion quality and caption quality.

Conclusion: Combining diffusion models with autoregressive generation through suggestion mechanisms is a promising research direction that leverages the strengths of both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results in image captioning.

Abstract: Diffusion Denoising models demonstrated impressive results across generative Computer Vision tasks, but they still fail to outperform standard autoregressive solutions in the discrete domain, and only match them at best. In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

### [4] [MetaVoxel: Joint Diffusion Modeling of Imaging and Clinical Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10041)
*Yihao Liu,Chenyu Gao,Lianrui Zuo,Michael E. Kim,Brian D. Boyd,Lisa L. Barnes,Walter A. Kukull,Lori L. Beason-Held,Susan M. Resnick,Timothy J. Hohman,Warren D. Taylor,Bennett A. Landman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion framework that models the complete distribution of brain MRI scans and clinical metadata, enabling unified zero-shot inference for multiple medical AI tasks without task-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for medical imaging are typically trained for specific predictive tasks with fixed input-output directions, requiring separate models for different applications. This limits flexibility and clinical applicability.

Method: MetaVoxel uses a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that learns a single diffusion process spanning all variables (imaging data and clinical metadata), capturing the complete joint distribution rather than conditional distributions.

Result: A single MetaVoxel model trained on >10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans with clinical metadata from nine datasets performs image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction with performance comparable to established task-specific baselines.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models, enabling flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining, which could broaden clinical applicability.

Abstract: Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.

### [5] [Independent Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10067)
*Jiahao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDE method improves compositional generalization in vision-language models by learning connections between individual words and image features, with two model variants using disentangled representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large-scale vision-language models struggle with human-like compositional generalization despite success in tasks like image captioning and conditioned image generation.

Method: Independent Density Estimation (IDE) learns connections between individual words and corresponding image features. Two models: one uses fully disentangled visual representations, another uses VAE for partially disentangled features. Also includes entropy-based compositional inference method.

Result: Models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models across various datasets.

Conclusion: IDE effectively addresses compositional generalization challenges in vision-language models through disentangled feature learning and word-level connections.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language models have achieved remarkable results in various domains, such as image captioning and conditioned image generation. Neverthe- less, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like composi- tional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy- based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TraceFlow is a framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes using a novel Gaussian splatting representation and hybrid rendering pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses two key challenges in rendering dynamic specular scenes: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling, which are essential for realistic rendering of complex dynamic environments with specular surfaces.

Method: Proposes Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic geometry/material modeling, Dynamic Environment Gaussian, and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse/specular components using rasterization and ray tracing, with coarse-to-fine training strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks show TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

Conclusion: TraceFlow successfully addresses key challenges in dynamic specular scene rendering through its novel Gaussian representation and hybrid rendering approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in producing realistic specular reflections.

Abstract: We present TraceFlow, a novel framework for high-fidelity rendering of dynamic specular scenes by addressing two key challenges: precise reflection direction estimation and physically accurate reflection modeling. To achieve this, we propose a Residual Material-Augmented 2D Gaussian Splatting representation that models dynamic geometry and material properties, allowing accurate reflection ray computation. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Environment Gaussian and a hybrid rendering pipeline that decomposes rendering into diffuse and specular components, enabling physically grounded specular synthesis via rasterization and ray tracing. Finally, we devise a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve optimization stability and promote physically meaningful decomposition. Extensive experiments on dynamic scene benchmarks demonstrate that TraceFlow outperforms prior methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, producing sharper and more realistic specular reflections in complex dynamic environments.

### [7] [What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10794)
*Jaskirat Singh,Xingjian Leng,Zongze Wu,Liang Zheng,Richard Zhang,Eli Shechtman,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iREPA improves generative model training by focusing on spatial structure rather than global semantic information when aligning representations from pretrained vision encoders to diffusion features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates what aspect of target representations matters for generation in representation alignment methods - whether it's global semantic information or spatial structure. Current wisdom assumes stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation, but this assumption is challenged.

Method: The authors conduct large-scale empirical analysis across 27 vision encoders and model scales. They then introduce iREPA with two simple modifications: replacing the standard MLP projection layer with a convolution layer, and adding a spatial normalization layer for external representations to better transfer spatial information.

Result: Results show that spatial structure, not global semantic performance, drives generation performance. iREPA consistently improves convergence speed across diverse vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT, etc.) with minimal code changes (<4 lines).

Conclusion: The work challenges prevailing assumptions about representation alignment, showing that spatial structure is more important than global semantics for generation. This motivates revisiting the fundamental mechanisms of representational alignment for improved generative model training.

Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes hierarchical instance tracking task with new benchmark dataset of 2,765 entities in 552 videos across 40 categories, showing current models struggle with this challenging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tracking methods focus on individual objects without considering hierarchical relationships between objects and their parts. There's a need for tracking that maintains these structural relationships for more comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: Introduces hierarchical instance tracking task and creates first benchmark dataset with 2,765 unique entities tracked in 552 videos across 40 object/part categories. Evaluates seven variants of four existing models adapted to this new task.

Result: The new dataset proves challenging for current models, as evaluation of adapted model variants shows significant difficulty in maintaining hierarchical relationships while tracking instances.

Conclusion: Hierarchical instance tracking is a novel and challenging task that requires new approaches beyond current tracking methods. The introduced benchmark dataset enables future research in this direction.

Abstract: We propose a novel task, hierarchical instance tracking, which entails tracking all instances of predefined categories of objects and parts, while maintaining their hierarchical relationships. We introduce the first benchmark dataset supporting this task, consisting of 2,765 unique entities that are tracked in 552 videos and belong to 40 categories (across objects and parts).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCTM achieves 85.14% bitrate reduction for edge-cloud split inference by compressing intermediate features, enabling efficient deployment in bandwidth-limited applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of DNNs faces compute constraints, while cloud offloading has latency/bandwidth/privacy issues. Edge-cloud splitting offers balance but creates bandwidth overhead from transmitting intermediate features.

Method: Developed Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM) as part of MPEG's FCM standard, creating bitstream syntax and codec pipeline specifically for compressing intermediate neural network features.

Result: Achieved average 85.14% bitrate reduction across multiple vision tasks while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating significant bandwidth savings.

Conclusion: FCM provides scalable, interoperable solution for efficient deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited, privacy-sensitive consumer applications through standardized feature compression.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.

### [10] [Latent Chain-of-Thought World Modeling for End-to-End Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10226)
*Shuhan Tan,Kashyap Chitta,Yuxiao Chen,Ran Tian,Yurong You,Yan Wang,Wenjie Luo,Yulong Cao,Philipp Krahenbuhl,Marco Pavone,Boris Ivanovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCDrive introduces latent chain-of-thought reasoning for autonomous driving, using action-aligned latent tokens instead of natural language to improve reasoning efficiency and driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models for autonomous driving use natural language for chain-of-thought reasoning, but text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning about driving actions and their outcomes.

Method: Proposes Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive) that expresses CoT in a latent language using action-proposal tokens (same vocabulary as output actions) and world model tokens (grounded in learned latent world model). Uses cold start supervision with ground-truth future rollouts followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning post-training.

Result: On large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: Latent chain-of-thought reasoning in an action-aligned space is more efficient than natural language reasoning for autonomous driving, leading to improved performance, safety, and inference speed.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for autonomous driving explore inference-time reasoning as a way to improve driving performance and safety in challenging scenarios. Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities. On a large-scale end-to-end driving benchmark, LCDrive achieves faster inference, better trajectory quality, and larger improvements from interactive reinforcement learning compared to both non-reasoning and text-reasoning baselines.

### [11] [Emerging Standards for Machine-to-Machine Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10230)
*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva,Borko Furht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCM (Feature Coding for Machines) compresses neural features for machine-to-machine communication, reducing bandwidth while maintaining accuracy close to edge inference, with existing codecs like HEVC performing comparably to newer VVC for machine tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-to-machine systems rely on pixel-based video streaming optimized for humans, which is bandwidth-intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. There's a need for more efficient, private, and scalable communication for machine vision applications.

Method: Two approaches: VCM (Video Coding for Machines) applies task-aware coding in pixel domain, while FCM (Feature Coding for Machines) compresses intermediate neural features. FCM reduces bitrate, preserves privacy, and supports compute offload by encoding features rather than pixels.

Result: FCM maintains accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. H.265/HEVC and H.266/VVC achieve almost identical machine task performance (1.39% BD-Rate increase when replacing VVC with HEVC), while H.264/AVC yields 32.28% BD-Rate increase compared to VVC. For tracking tasks, codec choice has minimal impact, with HEVC even outperforming VVC.

Conclusion: FCM enables efficient machine-to-machine communication with reduced bandwidth and privacy preservation. Existing hardware for deployed codecs (like HEVC) can support machine-to-machine communication without performance degradation, making FCM practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.

### [12] [Multi-dimensional Preference Alignment by Conditioning Reward Itself](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10237)
*Jiho Jang,Jinyoung Kim,Kyungjune Baek,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCDPO addresses reward conflicts in diffusion model alignment by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective with conditional preference vectors, enabling independent optimization of multiple reward axes within a single network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DPO formulations have a fundamental limitation: they aggregate diverse evaluation axes (like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment) into a single scalar reward using the Bradley-Terry model, creating reward conflicts where models unlearn desirable features from globally non-preferred samples.

Method: Proposes Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO) with a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective that explicitly injects preference outcome vectors as conditions during training, allowing independent optimization for each reward axis. Also introduces dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions.

Result: Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate superior performance on benchmarks. The conditional framework enables dynamic, multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

Conclusion: MCDPO effectively resolves reward conflicts in diffusion model alignment by enabling disentangled optimization of multiple reward dimensions, providing a more flexible and effective approach than standard DPO formulations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback has emerged as a standard for aligning diffusion models. However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.

### [13] [Solving Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Learning from an Auto-Annotation Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10244)
*Tian Liu,Anwesha Basu,James Caverlee,Shu Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT enables effective semi-supervised few-shot learning by addressing VLM's flat probability distributions through classifier initialization and temperature tuning, achieving performance close to supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) has neglected powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) despite their availability, while related FSL methods have successfully exploited them. Real-world auto-annotation applications require leveraging these open-source resources.

Method: Proposes Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which uses classifier initialization and temperature tuning to address VLM's flat probability distributions. This enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune VLMs using limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant noisy data from VLM's pretraining set.

Result: SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by ~5 accuracy points on five SSFSL benchmarks. Remarkably, SWIFT even rivals supervised learning that uses ground truth labels for all unlabeled data.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that simple techniques like classifier initialization and temperature tuning can effectively address VLM's flat probability distributions, enabling successful SSFSL with VLMs and achieving performance comparable to supervised learning.

Abstract: Semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) formulates real-world applications like ''auto-annotation'', as it aims to learn a model over a few labeled and abundant unlabeled examples to annotate the unlabeled ones. Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\sim$5 accuracy points. SWIFT even rivals supervised learning, which finetunes VLMs with the unlabeled data being labeled with ground truth!

### [14] [RobustSora: De-Watermarked Benchmark for Robust AI-Generated Video Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10248)
*Zhuo Wang,Xiliang Liu,Ligang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustSora benchmark evaluates watermark robustness in AIGC video detection, revealing 2-8pp performance variations under watermark manipulation across different model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AIGC video detection benchmarks overlook the influence of digital watermarks embedded by generative models, potentially allowing detectors to rely on these patterns rather than genuine content features.

Method: Created RobustSora benchmark with 6,500 videos across four categories (Authentic-Clean, Authentic-Spoofed, Generated-Watermarked, Generated-DeWatermarked) and two evaluation tasks testing watermark removal and fake watermark detection.

Result: Experiments with ten models show performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation: transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp).

Conclusion: Findings reveal partial watermark dependency in AIGC video detectors, highlighting the need for watermark-aware training strategies, with RobustSora providing essential tools for advancing robust detection research.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated video technologies poses challenges to information integrity. While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies. RobustSora provides essential tools to advance robust AIGC detection research.

*Eunho Lee,Chaehyeon Song,Seunghoon Jeong,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THE-Pose is a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that uses topological priors from surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion to overcome limitations of existing 3D graph convolution methods, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D graph convolution methods for category-level object pose estimation focus only on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. They lack global context needed to handle intra-class variations robustly.

Method: THE-Pose extracts consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain via surface embedding, then uses a Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module to adaptively integrate these topological features with point-cloud features, bridging 2D image context with 3D geometric structure.

Result: On the REAL275 dataset, THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics. The framework shows stability for unseen or complicated objects even under significant occlusions.

Conclusion: THE-Pose demonstrates that leveraging topological priors through surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion effectively overcomes limitations of existing 3D-GC methods, providing more robust category-level 6D pose estimation by combining 2D image context with 3D geometric structure.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation requires both global context and local structure to ensure robustness against intra-class variations. However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

Conclusion: GDKVM provides an effective solution for echocardiography video segmentation that balances accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications requiring real-time analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac chambers in echocardiography sequences is crucial for the quantitative analysis of cardiac function, aiding in clinical diagnosis and treatment. The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods rely solely on visual features which suffer from insufficient discriminability and are vulnerable to long-tail data distributions, creating a bottleneck for effective novel class discovery.

Method: Multimodal framework combining visual-textual semantics and prototype-guided clustering; jointly optimizes known class image/text features to model cluster centers; uses dual-phase discovery mechanism with semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering to dynamically separate known/novel samples.

Result: Achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes on CIFAR-100 dataset compared to current methods; demonstrates unique resilience to long-tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

Conclusion: LLM-NCD successfully breaks the bottleneck of visual-only NCD approaches by leveraging multimodal semantics, significantly improving novel class discovery performance and addressing the critical challenge of long-tail distributions.

Abstract: Novel Class Discovery aims to utilise prior knowledge of known classes to classify and discover unknown classes from unlabelled data. Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.

### [18] [Sample-wise Adaptive Weighting for Transfer Consistency in Adversarial Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10275)
*Hongsin Lee,Hye Won Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAAD improves adversarial distillation by reweighting training examples based on adversarial transferability, addressing robust saturation where stronger teachers don't always yield more robust students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial distillation methods often fail to effectively transfer robustness from state-of-the-art robust teachers to compact students, with stronger teachers not necessarily yielding more robust students (robust saturation phenomenon).

Method: Proposes Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD) that reweights training examples by their measured adversarial transferability (fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples effective against teacher) without additional computational cost.

Result: SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Conclusion: Adversarial transferability is a key factor in successful robustness transfer, and SAAD effectively addresses robust saturation by adaptively reweighting training examples based on transferability measurements.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation in the standard min-max adversarial training framework aims to transfer adversarial robustness from a large, robust teacher network to a compact student. However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HongsinLee/saad.

*Yixin Wan,Lei Ke,Wenhao Yu,Kai-Wei Chang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionEdit is a new dataset and benchmark for motion-centric image editing, with MotionNFT as a fine-tuning framework that improves motion editing quality in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing datasets focus on static appearance changes and lack high-quality motion edits. Motion-centric editing is scientifically challenging and practically important for applications like video synthesis and animation.

Method: 1) Created MotionEdit dataset with realistic motion transformations from continuous videos. 2) Developed MotionEdit-Bench benchmark with generative, discriminative, and preference metrics. 3) Proposed MotionNFT framework that computes motion alignment rewards to guide models toward accurate motion transformations during fine-tuning.

Result: MotionEdit-Bench shows motion editing is challenging for current SOTA diffusion models. MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity for FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit without sacrificing general editing ability.

Conclusion: MotionEdit addresses a critical gap in motion-centric image editing, providing both a benchmark and effective fine-tuning framework (MotionNFT) that significantly improves motion editing performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce MotionEdit, a novel dataset for motion-centric image editing-the task of modifying subject actions and interactions while preserving identity, structure, and physical plausibility. Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.
  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1 Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit show that MotionNFT consistently improves editing quality and motion fidelity of both base models on the motion editing task without sacrificing general editing ability, demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Xiaoxue Wu,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Yu Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShotDirector is a framework for controllable multi-shot video generation that integrates precise camera control with hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting to achieve film-like shot transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods focus on low-level visual consistency but neglect intentional film-editing patterns and cinematographic language, resulting in mere sequential shot changes without coherent narrative expression.

Method: Proposes ShotDirector with: 1) camera control module using 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings for precise camera information injection, 2) shot-aware mask mechanism with hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns for fine-grained content control.

Result: Creates ShotWeaver40K dataset capturing film-like editing pattern priors, develops evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation, and demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ShotDirector effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance to achieve film-like controllable shot transitions, addressing limitations in current multi-shot video generation approaches.

Abstract: Shot transitions play a pivotal role in multi-shot video generation, as they determine the overall narrative expression and the directorial design of visual storytelling. However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangled360 is a 3D-aware technology that combines direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° view synthesis for medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction, outperforming existing methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current techniques either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across different contexts, particularly in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction applications.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting backbone to differentiate isotropic/anisotropic contributions, dual-branch conditioning (CT intensity for volumetric data, normalized camera embeddings for RGB scenes), and hybrid pose-agnostic anchoring for scale ambiguity and structural realism.

Result: Superior SSIM and LPIPS performance on Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets, with runtime assessments confirming viability for interactive applications.

Conclusion: Disentangled360 enables mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation without scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations, integrating preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering.

Abstract: We introduce Disentangled360, an innovative 3D-aware technology that integrates the advantages of direction disentangled volume rendering with single-image 360° unique view synthesis for applications in medical imaging and natural scene reconstruction. In contrast to current techniques that either oversimplify anisotropic light behavior or lack generalizability across various contexts, our framework distinctly differentiates between isotropic and anisotropic contributions inside a Gaussian Splatting backbone. We implement a dual-branch conditioning framework, one optimized for CT intensity driven scattering in volumetric data and the other for real-world RGB scenes through normalized camera embeddings. To address scale ambiguity and maintain structural realism, we present a hybrid pose agnostic anchoring method that adaptively samples scene depth and material transitions, functioning as stable pivots during scene distillation. Our design integrates preoperative radiography simulation and consumer-grade 360° rendering into a singular inference pipeline, facilitating rapid, photorealistic view synthesis with inherent directionality. Evaluations on the Mip-NeRF 360, RealEstate10K, and DeepDRR datasets indicate superior SSIM and LPIPS performance, while runtime assessments confirm its viability for interactive applications. Disentangled360 facilitates mixed-reality medical supervision, robotic perception, and immersive content creation, eliminating the necessity for scene-specific finetuning or expensive photon simulations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient-VLN reduces training overhead in Vision-Language Navigation by using progressive/recursive memory mechanisms and dynamic mixed policy, achieving SOTA performance with 282 GPU hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs show promise in VLN but face high training overhead from processing long observation sequences and exploration-efficiency trade-offs in DAgger data aggregation.

Method: Two memory mechanisms: progressive memory (dynamic token allocation to recent observations) and learnable recursive memory (key-value cache of learnable tokens as memory state). Plus dynamic mixed policy to balance exploration-efficiency trade-off.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR) with only 282 H800 GPU hours, dramatically reducing training overhead compared to SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Efficient-VLN effectively addresses training efficiency challenges in VLN through innovative memory mechanisms and policy design, enabling practical development of MLLMs for navigation tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising potential in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN). However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR). Critically, our model consumes merely 282 H800 GPU hours, demonstrating a dramatic reduction in training overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning is effective for WSSS in digital pathology, demonstrating the value of vision-language alignment and multi-scale processing for improved region discovery under weak supervision.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology seeks to reduce annotation cost by learning from image-level labels, yet it remains limited by inter-class homogeneity, intra-class heterogeneity, and the region-shrinkage effect of CAM-based supervision.

Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes.

TL;DR: A prototype learning framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in histopathology that combines CONCH's morphology-aware representations, SegFormer's spatial cues, and text-guided semantic alignment to generate high-quality pseudo masks without dense annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current WSSS methods in histopathology rely on classification backbones that often only localize the most discriminative regions, failing to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. There's a need to combine the complementary strengths of vision-language models (rich semantic alignment) and modern segmentation backbones (fine-grained spatial cues) under weak supervision constraints.

Method: Proposes a prototype learning framework that integrates: 1) morphology-aware representations from CONCH, 2) multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and 3) text-guided semantic alignment. Uses text-guided prototype initialization with pathology descriptions for more complete pseudo-masks, and structural distillation to transfer spatial knowledge from SegFormer while preserving morphological patterns.

Result: Outperforms existing WSSS methods on BCSS-WSSS datasets, producing high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improving localization completeness, and enhancing semantic consistency across tissue types while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation models and lightweight adapters.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully integrates complementary strengths of vision-language models and segmentation backbones for WSSS in histopathology, achieving better performance through text-guided prototype initialization and structural distillation without requiring dense annotations.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) in histopathology relies heavily on classification backbones, yet these models often localize only the most discriminative regions and struggle to capture the full spatial extent of tissue structures. Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.

### [26] [EchoingPixels: Cross-Modal Adaptive Token Reduction for Efficient Audio-Visual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10324)
*Chao Gong,Depeng Wang,Zhipeng Wei,Ya Guo,Huijia Zhu,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingPixels is a token reduction framework for Audio-Visual LLMs that uses cross-modal attention to dynamically reduce tokens from a combined audio-visual pool, achieving 2-3x speedup with only 5-20% of original tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AV-LLMs face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Existing unimodal token reduction methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies, and static token budgets per modality are suboptimal due to distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video.

Method: EchoingPixels introduces Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2) that co-attends to joint multimodal streams and reduces tokens from a combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. It also includes Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain temporal relationships for sparsely selected tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments show EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of original tokens, with 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the token reduction bottleneck in AV-LLMs by enabling early audio-visual interaction and adaptive token allocation across modalities while preserving temporal modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) face prohibitive computational overhead from massive audio and video tokens. Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StainNet is a vision transformer-based foundation model specifically designed for special stain pathology images, trained on 1.4M patches from 20K+ WSIs, addressing limitations of existing H&E-focused models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pathology foundation models are primarily pre-trained on H&E-stained images, which limits their effectiveness for clinical applications involving special stains like immunohistochemistry that are frequently used in practice.

Method: Proposed StainNet, a specialized foundation model based on vision transformer architecture using self-distillation SSL, trained on over 1.4 million patch images from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database.

Result: Demonstrated strong performance on slide-level liver malignancy classification and two public ROI-level datasets, with additional validation through few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations showing advantages over larger PFMs.

Conclusion: StainNet addresses the gap in specialized foundation models for special stain pathology images, providing improved performance for clinical applications involving non-H&E stains and making model weights publicly available.

Abstract: Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Filament segmentation is crucial for biological analysis but suffers from data shortage due to the extreme difficulty of manual pixel-level annotation of dense, geometrically complex filaments like microtubules and actin filaments.

Method: Proposes a conditional generative framework based on Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filament microscopy images from binary masks, with a novel filament-aware structural loss to improve structural similarity in synthetic images.

Result: The approach demonstrated effectiveness and outperformed existing models trained without synthetic data, showing improved performance in filament segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed conditional generative framework with filament-aware structural loss successfully addresses the data shortage problem in filament segmentation by generating realistic synthetic training data, leading to improved segmentation performance.

Abstract: Thin and elongated filamentous structures, such as microtubules and actin filaments, often play important roles in biological systems. Segmenting these filaments in biological images is a fundamental step for quantitative analysis. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the performance of filament segmentation. However, there is a big challenge in acquiring high quality pixel-level annotated dataset for filamentous structures, as the dense distribution and geometric properties of filaments making manual annotation extremely laborious and time-consuming. To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks. We also propose a filament-aware structural loss to improve the structure similarity when generating synthetic images. Our experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and outperformed existing model trained without synthetic data.

TL;DR: HD-CLIP is a plug-and-play module that decomposes low-quality images into semantic and ordinal degradation embeddings to guide diffusion models for real-world image super-resolution, improving generalization across diverse unknown degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution faces challenges with unknown and complex coupled degradations. Existing methods assume known degradation severity and use CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity information, limiting their generalization ability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes HD-CLIP (Hierarchical Degradation CLIP) that decomposes low-quality images into semantic embedding and ordinal degradation embedding capturing ordered relationships. Integrated into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). Uses semantic cues for generative restoration while degradation cues suppress hallucinations and artifacts.

Result: HD-CLIP significantly improves detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets. As a plug-and-play module, it can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training.

Conclusion: HD-CLIP addresses limitations of existing methods by capturing both semantic and ordinal degradation information, enabling better generalization across unknown real-world degradations while suppressing artifacts in diffusion-based super-resolution.

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) aims to recover high-quality images from low-quality inputs degraded by unknown and complex real-world factors. Real-world scenarios involve diverse and coupled degradations, making it necessary to provide diffusion models with richer and more informative guidance. However, existing methods often assume known degradation severity and rely on CLIP text encoders that cannot capture numerical severity, limiting their generalization ability. To address this, we propose \textbf{HD-CLIP} (\textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}egradation CLIP), which decomposes a low-quality image into a semantic embedding and an ordinal degradation embedding that captures ordered relationships and allows interpolation across unseen levels. Furthermore, we integrated it into diffusion models via classifier-free guidance (CFG) and proposed classifier-free projection guidance (CFPG). HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts. As a \textbf{plug-and-play module}, HD-CLIP can be seamlessly integrated into various super-resolution frameworks without training, significantly improving detail fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSPlan benchmark evaluates VLMs on error-prone visual sequential planning tasks, revealing their limitations in error detection and step completion. Proposed SGI method improves performance by 5.2% through intermediate reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong reasoning capabilities but remain unexplored in visual sequential planning, especially in handling non-optimal/erroneous steps. There's a need to evaluate VLMs' ability to detect and correct errors in multi-step action sequences toward goals.

Method: Proposed Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) with 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction, and object reorganization. Evaluates Error Detection and Step Completion abilities. Introduced Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI) - a training-free method that adds intermediate reasoning steps between initial and goal states to help VLMs reason about sequences.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs (Intern-VLM, Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan despite using advanced reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs. SGI method yields average performance gain of 5.2% and generalizes to traditional planning tasks like Plan-Bench and VQA.

Conclusion: VLMs have significant limitations in error-prone visual sequential planning. The proposed SGI method effectively enhances VLMs' reasoning about sequences through intermediate steps, improving both corrective sequential planning and generalization to traditional planning tasks.

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive complex reasoning capabilities but remain largely unexplored in visual sequential planning, i.e., executing multi-step actions towards a goal. Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion generation methods rely on fixed skeletal templates, preventing generalization to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies.

Method: Introduces OmniZoo dataset (140 species, 32,979 sequences with multimodal annotations) and a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework. Core innovation is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling fusion with textual semantics.

Result: The method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions given text prompts and target skeletons. It enables cross-species motion style transfer and works with arbitrary skeletal topologies.

Conclusion: OmniZoo addresses the core limitations of current motion generation by providing both large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and a unified framework that generalizes across arbitrary skeletal topologies while maintaining text-driven control and cross-species transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Motion generation is fundamental to computer animation and widely used across entertainment, robotics, and virtual environments. While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.

TL;DR: TranSamba is a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation that efficiently captures 3D context with linear complexity scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches for medical imaging rely on 2D encoders that neglect the volumetric nature of the data, limiting their ability to capture 3D context effectively.

Method: TranSamba combines Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks that use state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices, enhancing pairwise self-attention within slices for better object localization.

Result: TranSamba achieves new state-of-the-art performance across three datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies while maintaining linear time complexity with input volume depth and constant memory usage.

Conclusion: TranSamba effectively addresses the limitations of 2D approaches for volumetric medical segmentation by providing efficient 3D context modeling with superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation offers a label-efficient solution to train segmentation models for volumetric medical imaging. However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TranSamba establishes new state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse modalities and pathologies.

TL;DR: mmCounter uses mmWave radar to count static people in dense indoor spaces by detecting ultra-low frequency breathing and micro-movements, achieving accurate counting without prior knowledge of person count.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mmWave radars struggle with detecting static people in dense groups due to spatial resolution limits and reliance on movement. Current breathing rate estimation methods assume known person count, which is unrealistic for real-world counting scenarios.

Method: Novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline that extracts ultra-low frequency (<1 Hz) signals from breathing and micro-scale body movements, differentiates these from background noise and static objects, and maps signal sources to individual people for counting.

Result: 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments; 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in untested environments. Can count up to 7 people in 3 square meters with minimal spacing.

Conclusion: mmCounter successfully addresses the challenge of counting static people in dense indoor environments using mmWave radar, overcoming limitations of existing approaches by focusing on ultra-low frequency physiological signals rather than movement.

Abstract: mmWave radars struggle to detect or count individuals in dense, static (non-moving) groups due to limitations in spatial resolution and reliance on movement for detection. We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments. It can count up to seven individuals in a three square meter space, such that there is no side-by-side spacing and only a one-meter front-to-back distance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex VideoQA tasks.

Method: Equip MLLMs with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, and propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools to progressively localize key areas in videos.

Result: STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework represent an important step toward building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) task serves as a critical playground for evaluating whether foundation models can effectively perceive, understand, and reason about dynamic real-world scenarios. However, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with simultaneously modeling spatial relationships within video frames and understanding the causal dynamics of temporal evolution on complex and reasoning-intensive VideoQA task. In this work, we equip MLLM with a comprehensive and extensible Video Toolkit, to enhance MLLM's spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities and ensure the harmony between the quantity and diversity of tools. To better control the tool invocation sequence and avoid toolchain shortcut issues, we propose a Spatiotemporal Reasoning Framework (STAR) that strategically schedules temporal and spatial tools, thereby progressively localizing the key area in the video. Our STAR framework enhances GPT-4o using lightweight tools, achieving an 8.2% gain on VideoMME and 4.6% on LongVideoBench. We believe that our proposed Video Toolkit and STAR framework make an important step towards building autonomous and intelligent video analysis assistants.

### [35] [Visual Funnel: Resolving Contextual Blindness in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10362)
*Woojun Jung,Jaehoon Go,Mingyu Jeon,Sunjae Yoon,Junyeong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Funnel addresses "Contextual Blindness" in MLLMs by creating a hierarchical portfolio of image crops based on attention entropy, preserving both fine details and global context without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual perception despite good reasoning capabilities. Existing crop-based methods cause "Contextual Blindness" - a structural disconnect between high-fidelity details from crops and global context from original images, limiting performance in precision-demanding tasks.

Method: Visual Funnel: a training-free, two-step approach. 1) Contextual Anchoring: identifies region of interest in single forward pass. 2) Entropy-Scaled Portfolio: constructs hierarchical context by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers, preserving focal detail to broader surroundings.

Result: Significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Adding more unstructured crops provides limited or detrimental benefits, confirming hierarchical structure is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Conclusion: The limitation stems from lack of "Structural Diversity" rather than information quantity. Visual Funnel's hierarchical portfolio effectively addresses Contextual Blindness by preserving both fine details and global context through structured multi-scale cropping.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, but often fail to perceive fine-grained visual details, limiting their applicability in precision-demanding tasks. While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: "Contextual Blindness". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P2S is a novel zero-shot framework for long video moment retrieval that addresses computational inefficiency in search phases and high-cost verification in refine phases through adaptive span generation and query decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) face limitations: supervised methods have poor scalability and generalization despite high resource consumption, while zero-shot methods suffer from candidate explosion in search phases and require costly VLM verification in refine phases.

Method: P2S introduces two key innovations: (1) Adaptive Span Generator to prevent candidate explosion in the search phase, and (2) Query Decomposition to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification, making it a training-free framework.

Result: P2S outperforms supervised state-of-the-art methods by significant margins, achieving +3.7% on R5@0.1 on the MAD benchmark, making it the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos.

Conclusion: P2S successfully addresses the dual challenges of ZLVMR by providing an efficient, training-free solution that eliminates candidate explosion in search phases and avoids costly VLM verification in refine phases, achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot Long Video Moment Retrieval (ZLVMR) is the task of identifying temporal segments in hour-long videos using a natural language query without task-specific training. The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \textbf{P}oint-\textbf{to}-\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases. P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification. To our knowledge, P2S is the first zero-shot framework capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming supervised state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin (e.g., +3.7\% on R5@0.1 on MAD).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoherentGS is a novel framework that enables high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images by combining deblurring and diffusion priors, breaking the vicious cycle between sparse views and motion blur in 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, but real-world applications often have sparse and motion-blurred data. These issues create a vicious cycle where sparse views can't resolve motion blur, and motion blur erases details needed for view alignment, leading to catastrophic reconstruction failures.

Method: CoherentGS uses a dual-prior strategy combining two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and photometric guidance, and a diffusion model for geometric priors to fill unobserved regions. The framework includes consistency-guided camera exploration and depth regularization for geometric plausibility.

Result: The method was evaluated on synthetic and real-world scenes with as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images.

Conclusion: CoherentGS successfully addresses the challenging problem of 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images by breaking the vicious cycle between these degradations, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods through a novel dual-prior generative approach.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a state-of-the-art method for novel view synthesis. However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaLiFlow: First joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR fusion, addressing radar noise/sparsity challenges with novel cross-modal fusion and loss functions, outperforming single-modal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D radar is cheaper and more weather-robust than LiDAR with point-wise velocity detection, but radar-LiDAR fusion for scene flow estimation is unexplored due to radar noise/low resolution and lack of suitable datasets.

Method: Created Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset from public automotive data with preprocessing for radar denoising and label generation. Proposed RaLiFlow framework with Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module integrating radar dynamic cues via local cross-attention, plus specialized loss functions to handle unreliable radar data and enhance instance-level consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods on the repurposed scene flow dataset.

Conclusion: The first successful radar-LiDAR fusion framework for scene flow estimation demonstrates effective cross-modal integration despite radar challenges, opening new possibilities for robust 3D motion estimation in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Recent multimodal fusion methods, integrating images with LiDAR point clouds, have shown promise in scene flow estimation. However, the fusion of 4D millimeter wave radar and LiDAR remains unexplored. Unlike LiDAR, radar is cheaper, more robust in various weather conditions and can detect point-wise velocity, making it a valuable complement to LiDAR. However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas. Extensive experiments on the repurposed scene flow dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing LiDAR-based and radar-based single-modal methods by a significant margin.

*Alberto Rota,Elena De Momi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised deep learning pipeline for feature matching in endoscopic surgery images, using novel-view synthesis for ground truth and contrastive learning to adapt DINOv2 for surgical domain matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical endoscopy requires precise pixel-level correspondences for 3D reconstruction and tracking, but faces challenges like weak perspective cues, tissue reflections, and deformable anatomy that degrade conventional computer vision techniques. Deep learning models trained on natural scenes need adaptation for surgical domains.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised pipeline using novel-view synthesis to generate ground-truth correspondences, then employs contrastive learning with triplets to augment DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer. The model produces embeddings for direct matching via cosine similarity thresholding.

Result: The pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SCARED datasets, achieving improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to related work.

Conclusion: The framework enables more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy by providing robust feature correspondences despite domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Accurate spatial understanding is essential for image-guided surgery, augmented reality integration and context awareness. In minimally invasive procedures, where visual input is the sole intraoperative modality, establishing precise pixel-level correspondences between endoscopic frames is critical for 3D reconstruction, camera tracking, and scene interpretation. However, the surgical domain presents distinct challenges: weak perspective cues, non-Lambertian tissue reflections, and complex, deformable anatomy degrade the performance of conventional computer vision techniques. While Deep Learning models have shown strong performance in natural scenes, their features are not inherently suited for fine-grained matching in surgical images and require targeted adaptation to meet the demands of this domain. This research presents a novel Deep Learning pipeline for establishing feature correspondences in endoscopic image pairs, alongside a self-supervised optimization framework for model training. The proposed methodology leverages a novel-view synthesis pipeline to generate ground-truth inlier correspondences, subsequently utilized for mining triplets within a contrastive learning paradigm. Through this self-supervised approach, we augment the DINOv2 backbone with an additional Transformer layer, specifically optimized to produce embeddings that facilitate direct matching through cosine similarity thresholding. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our pipeline surpasses state-of-the-art methodologies on the SCARED datasets improved matching precision and lower epipolar error compared to the related work. The proposed framework constitutes a valuable contribution toward enabling more accurate high-level computer vision applications in surgical endoscopy.

Method: Proposes FROW benchmark for detailed evaluation of LVLMs using GPT-4o. Introduces optimization strategy from two perspectives: data construction (mosaic data combining multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data from real-world Q&A) and training process (incorporating fine-grained data into pre-training).

Conclusion: The FROW benchmark addresses the gap in fine-grained recognition evaluation for LVLMs, and the proposed optimization strategies effectively improve model performance on fine-grained recognition tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable progress, enabling sophisticated vision-language interaction and dialogue applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on reasoning tasks, often neglecting fine-grained recognition, which is crucial for practical application scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Fine-grained Recognition Open World (FROW) benchmark, designed for detailed evaluation of LVLMs with GPT-4o. On the basis of that, we propose a novel optimization strategy from two perspectives: \textit{data construction} and \textit{training process}, to improve the performance of LVLMs. Our dataset includes mosaic data, which combines multiple short-answer responses, and open-world data, generated from real-world questions and answers using GPT-4o, creating a comprehensive framework for evaluating fine-grained recognition in LVLMs. Experiments show that mosaic data improves category recognition accuracy by 1\% and open-world data boosts FROW benchmark accuracy by 10\%-20\% and content accuracy by 6\%-12\%. Meanwhile, incorporating fine-grained data into the pre-training phase can improve the model's category recognition accuracy by up to 10\%.

*Ge Zhang,Chunyang Wang,Bo Xiao,Xuelian Liu,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive dual-weight gravitational point cloud denoising method achieving high accuracy, edge preservation, and real-time performance through octree partitioning, adaptive voxel filtering, and gravitational scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR point clouds suffer from noise that degrades object detection accuracy. Existing methods trade off computational efficiency for accuracy or vice versa, failing to achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance simultaneously.

Method: 1) Octree spatial partitioning for parallel acceleration; 2) Adaptive voxel occupancy statistics and kNN density estimation to remove isolated/low-density noise; 3) Gravitational scoring function combining density weights with adaptive distance weights to distinguish noise from object points.

Result: Experiments on Stanford 3D Repository, CADC dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR show consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance across various noise conditions while reducing single-frame processing time.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios, effectively balancing denoising quality with computational efficiency.

Abstract: High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube has intensified multimodal hate speech spread, where harmful cues emerge subtly across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research focuses only on video-level classification, leaving temporal localization largely unaddressed, especially under weak supervision where only video-level labels are available.

Result: Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip datasets show MultiHateLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in temporal localization task, producing fine-grained frame-level predictions despite using only coarse video-level labels.

Conclusion: MultiHateLoc successfully addresses the challenging task of weakly-supervised multimodal hate localization, providing interpretable frame-level predictions and outperforming existing methods while relying solely on video-level supervision.

Abstract: The rapid growth of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has intensified the spread of multimodal hate speech, where harmful cues emerge subtly and asynchronously across visual, acoustic, and textual streams. Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision. Despite relying solely on coarse labels, MultiHateLoc produces fine-grained, interpretable frame-level predictions. Experiments on HateMM and MultiHateClip show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the localisation task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad model for off-road road network extraction, addressing domain gaps and topological errors in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for vectorized road extraction work well in urban settings but fail in off-road environments due to domain gaps, lack of large-scale datasets, and structural weaknesses in node-centric approaches that are fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions.

Method: Two complementary approaches: 1) Release WildRoad - a global off-road road network dataset created with a dedicated interactive annotation tool; 2) Introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor) - a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.

Result: MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. The streamlined pipeline yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability.

Conclusion: The WildRoad dataset and MaGRoad's path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in wild terrains, addressing limitations of existing urban-focused approaches.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced vectorized road extraction in urban settings, yet off-road environments remain underexplored and challenging. A significant domain gap causes advanced models to fail in wild terrains due to two key issues: lack of large-scale vectorized datasets and structural weakness in prevailing methods. Models such as SAM-Road employ a node-centric paradigm that reasons at sparse endpoints, making them fragile to occlusions and ambiguous junctions in off-road scenes, leading to topological errors.This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a gloabal off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.

*Xiao Chen,Zhongjing Du,Jiazhen Huang,Xu Jiang,Li Lu,Jingyan Jiang,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes NCTTA, a novel Test-Time Adaptation method that addresses performance degradation under domain shifts by leveraging Neural Collapse theory and introducing Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+) to identify and correct feature-classifier misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Test-Time Adaptation methods lack theoretical insights into why performance degrades under domain shifts, and unreliable pseudo-labels during adaptation exacerbate this problem. The authors aim to provide a theoretical foundation and practical solution for better feature-classifier alignment during TTA.

Method: The authors extend Neural Collapse to sample-wise level, discovering NC3+ phenomenon. They propose NCTTA which uses hybrid targets blending geometric proximity (based on NC3+ alignment) with predictive confidence to mitigate unreliable pseudo-labels during adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments show NCTTA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 14.52% improvement over Tent on ImageNet-C, demonstrating enhanced robustness to domain shifts.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretical insights into TTA performance degradation through NC3+ and offers a practical solution (NCTTA) that effectively addresses feature-classifier misalignment under domain shifts, significantly improving adaptation performance.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) enhances model robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data by updating the model online during inference, yet existing methods lack theoretical insights into the fundamental causes of performance degradation under domain shifts. Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose NCTTA, a novel feature-classifier alignment method with hybrid targets to mitigate the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels, which blends geometric proximity with predictive confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NCTTA in enhancing robustness to domain shifts. For example, NCTTA outperforms Tent by 14.52% on ImageNet-C.

### [47] [Error-Propagation-Free Learned Video Compression With Dual-Domain Progressive Temporal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10450)
*Han Li,Shaohui Li,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Xinlong Pan,Haipeng Wang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified-transform video compression framework with dual-domain temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to eliminate error propagation while maintaining competitive rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the dilemma in learned video compression between inaccurate temporal alignment with error propagation (separate-transform framework) and inferior motion estimation/compensation without error propagation (unified-transform framework).

Method: Dual-domain progressive temporal alignment: coarse pixel-domain alignment for simple motion, refined latent-domain alignment using Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer for complex motion. QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation with dynamic expert assignment based on target quality and content.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while successfully eliminating error propagation.

Conclusion: Proposed framework enables quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression through dual-domain temporal alignment and adaptive quantization.

Abstract: Existing frameworks for learned video compression suffer from a dilemma between inaccurate temporal alignment and error propagation for motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC). The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.

*Khurram Ashfaq,Muhammad Tariq Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid Shape-from-Focus method combining traditional DDL kernels for focus volume computation with lightweight GRU-based refinement and learned upsampling for high-quality depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning SFF methods use heavy feature encoders and simple aggregation that introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in depth maps. The authors aim to address these issues with a more efficient and accurate approach.

Method: Hybrid framework: 1) Compute multi-scale focus volumes using traditional Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels to capture long-range directional focus variations; 2) Feed focus volumes into lightweight multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module for iterative refinement; 3) Use learned convex upsampling module within recurrent network to reconstruct high-resolution depth maps.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework effectively combines traditional focus volume computation with lightweight deep learning refinement, resulting in more accurate and artifact-free depth estimation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Shape-from-Focus (SFF) is a passive depth estimation technique that infers scene depth by analyzing focus variations in a focal stack. Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.

Conclusion: TaP addresses a critical limitation in FSS by enhancing encoder generalization to novel classes, paving the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems. The method is computationally efficient and model-agnostic.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes in query images using only a small annotated support set. While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blink is a dynamic visual token resolution framework for MLLMs that emulates human "blink-like" scanning by selectively allocating more computation to salient visual regions, enhancing visual perception efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs have limited visual perception compared to humans who efficiently perceive scenes through dynamic scanning and focusing on salient regions. The authors investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior and find they naturally attend to different visual regions across layers, suggesting selective computation allocation could enhance perception.

Method: Blink framework with two modules: 1) Saliency-guided scanning that estimates visual token importance using attention maps, and 2) Dynamic token resolution that extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module, then drops extended tokens when they lose focus in subsequent layers.

Result: Extensive experiments validate Blink's effectiveness in enhancing both visual perception and multimodal understanding, demonstrating improved performance through adaptive computation allocation.

Conclusion: Blink successfully emulates human-inspired dynamic visual processing within MLLMs, balancing broad exploration with fine-grained focus to enhance visual perception efficiently in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various vision-language tasks, yet their visual perception remains limited. Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential "blink-like" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs using autoregressive Transformers have limited ability to accurately ground objects in 2D image space due to tokenization limitations, creating a need for better spatial representation.

Method: GETok integrates specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens: grid tokens partition image plane into spatial anchors, and offset tokens enable precise iterative refinement of localization predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show GETok achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

Conclusion: GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning by embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens while maintaining the autoregressive architecture.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in vision understanding and reasoning. However, the autoregressive Transformer architecture used by MLLMs requries tokenization on input images, which limits their ability to accurately ground objects within the 2D image space. This raises an important question: how can sequential language tokens be improved to better ground objects in 2D spatial space for MLLMs? To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GETok achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various referring tasks in both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and long-tail distribution problems in isolated sign language recognition, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive and standard classification approaches struggle with overfitting to frequent classes while failing on rare ones.

Method: Proposes a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for skeleton-based encoder, using episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on proximity to dynamic class prototypes. Integrates Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics.

Result: Achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on WLASL test set, outperforming standard classification baseline with identical backbone architecture by over 13%. Also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization with nearly 30% accuracy on unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The prototypical training strategy effectively addresses data scarcity where standard classification fails, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data through metric learning paradigm and strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is critical for bridging the communication gap between the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community and the hearing world. However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.

Conclusion: AVI-Edit provides an effective framework for audio-synchronized video instance editing with improved spatial and temporal control, addressing key limitations in current video editing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation highlight that realistic audio-visual synchronization is crucial for engaging content creation. However, existing video editing methods largely overlook audio-visual synchronization and lack the fine-grained spatial and temporal controllability required for precise instance-level edits. In this paper, we propose AVI-Edit, a framework for audio-sync video instance editing. We propose a granularity-aware mask refiner that iteratively refines coarse user-provided masks into precise instance-level regions. We further design a self-feedback audio agent to curate high-quality audio guidance, providing fine-grained temporal control. To facilitate this task, we additionally construct a large-scale dataset with instance-centric correspondence and comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVI-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, condition following, and audio-visual synchronization.

TL;DR: Symmetric U-Net architecture for all-in-one image restoration achieves state-of-the-art performance with simpler design than complex existing methods, using aligned feature scales and streamlined cross-scale propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing all-in-one image restoration methods rely on complex architectures (Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. The authors reveal that well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to effectively unleash these cues.

Method: Proposes SymUNet, a symmetric U-Net architecture that aligns feature scales across encoder-decoder and enables streamlined cross-scale propagation. This preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, making simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient. Also proposes SE-SymUNet variant that integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors.

Result: SymUNet achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. Both SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for all-in-one image restoration, validated through extensive experiments on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: A symmetric U-Net architecture with aligned feature scales and streamlined cross-scale propagation is sufficient for state-of-the-art all-in-one image restoration, providing a simpler and stronger foundation than complex existing methods. The semantic-enhanced variant further improves performance through direct semantic injection from CLIP features.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to handle diverse degradations (e.g., noise, blur, adverse weather) within a unified framework, yet existing methods increasingly rely on complex architectures (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts, diffusion models) and elaborate degradation prompt strategies. In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods. Both baselines SymUNet and SE-SymUNet establish simpler and stronger foundations for future advancements in all-in-one image restoration.

TL;DR: A salient object detection framework designed for diverse weather conditions using a noise indicator fusion module to embed weather-aware priors into the encoder, compatible with mainstream SOD decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions and overlook degradation from weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios, creating a need for robust SOD under diverse weather conditions.

Method: Proposes a SOD framework with specific encoder and replaceable decoder, introduces one-hot vector as noise indicator for different weather types, designs Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM) that takes semantic features and noise indicator as dual inputs, inserted between encoder stages for adaptive feature modulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on WXSOD dataset with varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30%), three encoder and seven decoder configurations show the proposed framework (especially NIFM-enhanced encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to vanilla encoder.

Conclusion: The proposed SOD framework effectively handles weather-induced noise through weather-aware priors embedded via NIFM, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy in diverse weather conditions while maintaining compatibility with existing SOD decoders.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the semantic gap in remote sensing image retrieval and overcome limitations of existing VLM methods that require costly domain-specific training, while lacking benchmarks for evaluating VLM-generated text in zero-shot retrieval contexts.

Method: Introduce RSRT dataset with structured captions, then propose TRSLLaVA - a training-free approach that reformulates cross-modal retrieval as text-to-text matching, using rich text descriptions as queries against VLM-generated captions in a unified textual embedding space.

Result: Achieves mean Recall of 42.62% on RSITMD, nearly doubling the 23.86% of standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models, showing competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

Conclusion: High-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval, validating that training-free methods can achieve competitive results with supervised approaches.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval of remote sensing (RS) images is a critical task fundamentally challenged by the \textquote{semantic gap}, the discrepancy between a model's low-level visual features and high-level human concepts. While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models. This validates that high-quality semantic representation through structured text provides a powerful and cost-effective paradigm for remote sensing image retrieval.

Abstract: We propose Track and Caption Any Motion (TCAM), a motion-centric framework for automatic video understanding that discovers and describes motion patterns without user queries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOCR-Inspector is a VLM-based framework for fine-grained error detection and quality assessment in document parsing, using hierarchical error classification and Chain-of-Checklist reasoning to evaluate real-world parsing performance beyond standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for document parsing models have dataset-specific biases that lead to inconsistent rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Current metrics provide only overall scores, obscuring specific error patterns, making comprehensive quality assessment in real-world scenarios challenging.

Method: DOCR-Inspector formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection using VLM-as-a-Judge. It analyzes document images and parsed outputs, identifies errors across 28 predefined types, and uses Chain-of-Checklist reasoning for hierarchical quality assessment. The system is trained on DOCRcase-200K dataset.

Result: DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and leading open-source models on DOCRcaseBench (882 real-world cases with manual annotations). The quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing refinement, making it both a practical evaluator and driver for improving parsing systems.

Conclusion: DOCR-Inspector addresses the challenge of reliable document parsing assessment in real-world scenarios through fine-grained error analysis, offering a comprehensive evaluation framework that goes beyond standard benchmark limitations and enables systematic improvement of parsing systems.

Abstract: Document parsing aims to transform unstructured PDF images into semi-structured data, facilitating the digitization and utilization of information in diverse domains. While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models focus on surface geometry and appearance but neglect internal physical properties like volumetric density, which are crucial for predicting object behavior in robotics and simulation. The main limitation has been the lack of large-scale real-world data for physical property estimation.

Method: Introduced XDen-1K dataset with 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, providing high-resolution 3D geometric models with part-level annotations and biplanar X-ray scans. Developed a novel optimization framework to recover volumetric density fields from sparse X-ray views, and enhanced segmentation networks with X-ray conditioning.

Result: The dataset enables accurate volumetric density estimation and improves center-of-mass prediction accuracy. When integrated with segmentation networks, it enhances volumetric segmentation performance. Downstream robotics experiments show increased success rates in manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: XDen-1K serves as a foundational resource and benchmark for physically grounded visual inference, bridging the gap between surface appearance and internal physical properties, with demonstrated benefits for embodied AI applications like robotic manipulation.

Abstract: A deep understanding of the physical world is a central goal for embodied AI and realistic simulation. While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.

Motivation: Current zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods rely on large-scale models and cloud inference, causing high latency, energy consumption, and deployment risks (connectivity, cost, data governance) that conflict with practical robotics constraints requiring on-device inference with limited compute.

Method: Combines foundation model visual features with geometric filtering: computes similarity maps between template DINO descriptors and scene patches, establishes mutual correspondences by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to object model coordinates, recovers poses via correspondence-driven RANSAC, and ranks poses using a weighted geometric alignment metric considering reprojection consistency and spatial support.

Result: Achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). Requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones.

Conclusion: Geo6DPose advances practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment by trading model scale for geometric reliability, addressing latency, energy, and deployment constraints of real-world robotics applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in zero-shot 6D object pose estimation has been driven largely by large-scale models and cloud-based inference. However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS).

Method: SHARP uses a neural network to regress parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation from a single photograph in a single feedforward pass (under 1 second on GPU). The resulting metric 3D Gaussian representation supports absolute scale and can be rendered in real time for nearby views.

Result: SHARP achieves robust zero-shot generalization across datasets, sets new SOTA on multiple benchmarks, reduces LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus best prior models, and lowers synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: SHARP demonstrates that high-quality photorealistic view synthesis from single images is achievable with efficient 3D Gaussian representations, offering significant improvements in quality, speed, and generalization over previous approaches.

Abstract: We present SHARP, an approach to photorealistic view synthesis from a single image. Given a single photograph, SHARP regresses the parameters of a 3D Gaussian representation of the depicted scene. This is done in less than a second on a standard GPU via a single feedforward pass through a neural network. The 3D Gaussian representation produced by SHARP can then be rendered in real time, yielding high-resolution photorealistic images for nearby views. The representation is metric, with absolute scale, supporting metric camera movements. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARP delivers robust zero-shot generalization across datasets. It sets a new state of the art on multiple datasets, reducing LPIPS by 25-34% and DISTS by 21-43% versus the best prior model, while lowering the synthesis time by three orders of magnitude.

*Matias Cosarinsky,Nicolas Gaggion,Rodrigo Echeveste,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces uncertainty estimation methods for anatomical landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, releasing a large dataset with per-node uncertainty estimates to enhance robustness and safe clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, but prior work has focused on pixel-level uncertainty while landmark-based segmentation with topological guarantees remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective.

Method: The authors use hybrid neural network architectures combining standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, leveraging their variational latent space to derive two complementary uncertainty measures: latent uncertainty (from learned distribution parameters) and predictive uncertainty (from multiple stochastic output predictions).

Result: Both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity in controlled corruption experiments, reflecting global and local degradation. The uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions compared to manual ground-truth and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset.

Conclusion: The work establishes uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-rays, supported by the release of CheXmask-U dataset with 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations and per-node uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for the safe clinical deployment of medical image segmentation systems, enabling the identification of unreliable predictions and supporting human oversight. While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceDrive is a spatial-aware VLM-based autonomous driving framework that uses explicit positional encodings for 3D spatial information instead of textual digit tokens, improving spatial reasoning and planning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision language models (VLMs) struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships, which is essential for autonomous driving systems interacting with the physical world. This limitation hinders their ability to perform accurate spatial reasoning for driving tasks.

Method: SpaceDrive treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings rather than textual digit tokens. It uses a universal positional encoder for all 3D coordinates from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D positional encodings augment 2D visual tokens and serve as task-agnostic coordinate representations, replacing digit-wise numerical tokens for both inputs and outputs.

Result: SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark among existing VLM-based methods.

Conclusion: By explicitly encoding spatial information as positional encodings rather than textual tokens, SpaceDrive enables better spatial reasoning and direct trajectory coordinate regression, significantly improving autonomous driving performance compared to existing VLM-based approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods built on vision language models (VLMs) have undergone rapid development driven by their universal visual understanding and strong reasoning capabilities obtained from the large-scale pretraining. However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.

Abstract: Depth estimation in videos is essential for visual perception in real-world applications. However, existing methods either rely on simple frame-by-frame monocular models, leading to temporal inconsistencies and inaccuracies, or use computationally demanding temporal modeling, unsuitable for real-time applications. These limitations significantly restrict general applicability and performance in practical settings. To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

Conclusion: The interleaved reasoning paradigm successfully bridges motion understanding and generation, demonstrating that assessment and refinement tasks enable bidirectional knowledge flow and improve motion generation performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion-aware large language models have shown remarkable promise for unifying motion understanding and generation tasks. However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks. Cross-evaluator testing further validates its effectiveness. Code & Data: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/IRG-MotionLLM/tree/main.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based simulation of coronary blood flow provides valuable hemodynamic markers, such as pressure gradients, for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches.

TL;DR: GLAT-IRM: A graph-based transformer with iterative refinement for prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images, improving patch selection and spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prostate cancer grading from WSIs is challenging due to large image scale, tissue heterogeneity, and difficulty selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing methods using random/static patch selection include redundant/non-informative regions that degrade performance.

Method: Propose Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) with Iterative Refinement Module (IRM). IRM iteratively refines patch selection using pretrained ResNet50 for local features and foundation model for importance scoring. GLAT models tissue connectivity via graph where patches are nodes, uses graph Laplacian constraints for spatial consistency, and learnable filtering to enhance discriminative features. Convex aggregation dynamically adjusts patch importance for WSI-level representation.

Result: Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset show the model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GLAT-IRM framework effectively addresses challenges in prostate cancer grading by improving patch selection through iterative refinement and enhancing spatial consistency through graph-based modeling, resulting in superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Wang Lu,Jindong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEPL method enhances domain generalization robustness against label noise by leveraging intermediate features with multiple probing classifiers and ensemble inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization methods degrade when encountering noisy labels due to spurious feature enlargement in deep layers, creating a need for noise-robust approaches.

Method: Self-Ensemble Post Learning (SEPL) with feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference, using semi-supervised algorithms for probing classifiers and crowdsourcing inference for integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show SEPL enhances robustness of existing methods and exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: SEPL effectively addresses the challenge of noisy labels in domain generalization by diversifying features through intermediate representations and ensemble techniques.

Abstract: While computer vision and machine learning have made great progress, their robustness is still challenged by two key issues: data distribution shift and label noise. When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.

Conclusion: PoseGAM successfully eliminates the need for explicit feature matching in 6D object pose estimation while effectively incorporating geometry information, resulting in superior performance and generalization capabilities for unseen objects.

Abstract: 6D object pose estimation, which predicts the transformation of an object relative to the camera, remains challenging for unseen objects. Existing approaches typically rely on explicitly constructing feature correspondences between the query image and either the object model or template images.

Built upon recent multi-view-based foundation model architectures, the method integrates object geometry information through two complementary mechanisms: explicit point-based geometry and learned features from geometry representation networks. In addition, we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset containing more than 190k objects under diverse environmental conditions to enhance robustness and generalization.

TL;DR: SWiT-4D is a method that converts monocular videos into animated 3D assets with 4D meshes by leveraging image-to-3D diffusion priors and adding temporal modeling through a sliding-window transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a challenge in converting monocular videos to high-quality 4D meshes due to limited 4D datasets, while image-to-3D generation has strong priors from extensive datasets that could be leveraged for video-to-4D tasks.

Method: SWiT-4D uses a sliding-window transformer that integrates with any DiT-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving single-image forward process. It includes an optimization-based trajectory module for global translation recovery in static-camera videos.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency with minimal data (single short video for fine-tuning). It outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness on various benchmarks including C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency and practical deployability for 4D mesh generation from monocular videos by effectively leveraging image-to-3D priors while requiring minimal 4D supervision.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 4D content generation, the conversion of monocular videos into high-quality animated 3D assets with explicit 4D meshes remains considerably challenging. The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion capture pipelines are limited to specific species or templates, creating a gap for handling arbitrary 3D assets. The authors formalize this as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap) to enable scalable, prompt-driven motion capture for any rigged 3D asset.

Method: A reference-guided, factorized framework with three learnable modules: (1) Reference Prompt Encoder extracts per-joint queries from asset skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) Video Feature Extractor computes visual descriptors and reconstructs coarse 4D deforming mesh; (3) Unified Motion Decoder fuses cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories, followed by constraint-aware inverse kinematics to recover asset-specific rotations.

The system is validated using Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips providing standardized skeleton-mesh-render triads.

Conclusion: MoCapAnything enables scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets, bridging the gap between video and joint space while supporting cross-species retargeting across diverse rig configurations.

Abstract: Motion capture now underpins content creation far beyond digital humans, yet most existing pipelines remain species- or template-specific. We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in table extraction has been limited by lack of annotated data, especially for multi-page table structure recognition.

Method: Created PubTables-v2 dataset supporting multiple table extraction tasks, including first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. Used this dataset to evaluate domain-specialized VLMs and develop POTATR (Page-Object Table Transformer), an image-to-graph extension of Table Transformer for page-level table extraction.

Result: PubTables-v2 enables evaluation of current vision-language models on challenging table extraction tasks. The dataset demonstrates usefulness for benchmarking and model development, with POTATR showing promise for comprehensive page-level table extraction.

Conclusion: PubTables-v2 addresses the data bottleneck in table extraction research, providing a valuable benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition and enabling development of more advanced models like POTATR for comprehensive document understanding.

Abstract: Table extraction (TE) is a key challenge in visual document understanding. Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.

*Peiying Zhang,Nanxuan Zhao,Matthew Fisher,Yiran Xu,Jing Liao,Difan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DuetSVG is a multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and SVG tokens end-to-end, using visual predictions to guide SVG decoding for better quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based SVG generation methods produce only text and lack visual signals during decoding, leading to poor handling of complex semantics and producing visually unappealing or geometrically incoherent SVGs.

Method: DuetSVG is a unified multimodal model trained on both image and SVG datasets that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. It uses a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method outperforms existing approaches, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

Conclusion: Joint multimodal generation of both visual and SVG representations with test-time visual guidance significantly improves SVG generation quality compared to text-only approaches.

Abstract: Recent vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches have achieved impressive results on SVG generation. However, because they generate only text and lack visual signals during decoding, they often struggle with complex semantics and fail to produce visually appealing or geometrically coherent SVGs. We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods, producing visually faithful, semantically aligned, and syntactically clean SVGs across a wide range of applications.

TL;DR: FoundationMotion is an automated pipeline for creating large-scale motion datasets using object tracking and LLMs, enabling models to achieve state-of-the-art motion understanding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with motion understanding due to scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets, which are expensive to create through manual annotation.

Method: Automated pipeline that detects/tracks objects in videos to extract trajectories, then uses trajectories and video frames with LLMs to generate fine-grained captions and diverse QA pairs about motion and spatial reasoning.

Result: Fine-tuned models (NVILA-Video-15B, Qwen2.5-7B) achieved substantial improvements in motion understanding, outperforming strong baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion benchmarks.

Conclusion: FoundationMotion provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that effectively enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities in diverse models.

Abstract: Motion understanding is fundamental to physical reasoning, enabling models to infer dynamics and predict future states. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks. FoundationMotion thus provides a scalable solution for curating fine-grained motion datasets that enable effective fine-tuning of diverse models to enhance motion understanding and spatial reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: A real-time talking head method using Gaussian Splatting with 3D Morphable Models and transformer-based audio-to-parameter prediction for temporal stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech-driven talking head methods face limitations: diffusion methods struggle with one-shot settings, while Gaussian Splatting approaches suffer from facial tracking inaccuracies and inconsistent mappings leading to unstable outputs and video artifacts that hinder realistic applications.

Method: The method maps Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. It introduces transformer-based prediction of model parameters directly from audio to drive temporal consistency. The system works from monocular video and independent audio speech inputs.

Result: The method enables generation of real-time talking head videos with competitive quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses the temporal stability and realism issues in current talking head methods by combining Gaussian Splatting with 3D Morphable Models and transformer-based audio parameter prediction, enabling practical real-world applications.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking heads have recently emerged and enable interactive avatars. However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VL-JEPA is a vision-language model using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that predicts continuous text embeddings instead of tokens, achieving better performance with fewer parameters and supporting selective decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of autoregressive token generation in VLMs by learning in abstract representation space, focusing on task-relevant semantics while reducing surface-level linguistic variability.

Method: Uses Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to predict continuous embeddings of target texts rather than generating tokens. Employs a lightweight text decoder only when needed at inference time.

Result: Achieves stronger performance with 50% fewer trainable parameters than standard token-space VLMs. Supports selective decoding (2.85x reduction in decoding operations). Surpasses CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder on video tasks. Comparable to classical VLMs on VQA datasets with only 1.6B parameters.

Conclusion: VL-JEPA demonstrates that predicting continuous embeddings in abstract representation space is more efficient and effective than token-space generation, enabling better performance with fewer parameters and supporting diverse vision-language tasks.

Abstract: We introduce VL-JEPA, a vision-language model built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.

TL;DR: MeViS dataset introduces large-scale multi-modal referring motion expression video segmentation with 33K motion expressions for 8K+ objects in 2K+ videos, benchmarking 15 methods across 4 tasks and proposing LMPM++ approach achieving SOTA results.


<details>

Motivation: Existing referring video segmentation datasets focus on static attributes and salient objects, underemphasizing motion in both videos and language expressions. There's a need to explore motion expression and reasoning for pixel-level video understanding in complex scenarios.

Method: Created MeViS dataset with 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions (text and audio) covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 complex videos. Benchmarked 15 existing methods across 4 tasks: RVOS, AVOS, RMOT, and newly introduced RMEG. Proposed LMPM++ approach for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks.

Result: Results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in motion expression-guided video understanding. LMPM++ achieves new state-of-the-art results on RVOS/AVOS/RMOT tasks. Dataset provides platform for developing motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms.

Conclusion: MeViS dataset addresses the gap in motion-focused video understanding, revealing limitations of current methods and enabling development of better motion expression-guided algorithms for complex video scenes through comprehensive benchmarking and proposed LMPM++ approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a large-scale multi-modal dataset for referring motion expression video segmentation, focusing on segmenting and tracking target objects in videos based on language description of objects' motions. Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving systems, challenging the prevailing assumption that 3D priors (BEV, occupancy, tri-plane) are necessary for effective scene encoding.

Method: Uses a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. Geometry-agnostic approach learns compact scene representation directly from data without explicit 3D inductive biases, aggressively compressing visual input for downstream LLM-based policy models.

Result: Achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods on a 20,000-hour proprietary dataset. Scene tokens develop emergent capability for scene decomposition without explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers more scalable, efficient and effective path for autonomous driving systems than methods relying on explicit 3D priors, challenging prevailing assumptions about 3D representation necessity.

Abstract: We present Flex, an efficient and effective scene encoder that addresses the computational bottleneck of processing high-volume multi-camera data in end-to-end autonomous driving. Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that 3D priors are necessary, demonstrating that a data-driven, joint encoding strategy offers a more scalable, efficient and effective path for future autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: ClusIR is a cluster-guided image restoration framework that uses learnable clustering to model degradation semantics and adaptively restore images across diverse degradations through probabilistic routing and frequency modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing All-in-One Image Restoration methods fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations, limiting their effectiveness in handling diverse degradation scenarios.

Method: ClusIR uses two key components: 1) Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) that disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation for discriminative perception and stable routing, and 2) Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM) that leverages cluster-guided priors for adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation to refine structural and textural representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR achieves competitive performance across various degradation scenarios, demonstrating remarkable restoration results for a wide range of degradations.

Conclusion: ClusIR successfully bridges semantic degradation cues with frequency-domain modulation through cluster-guided synergy, enabling adaptive restoration across diverse degradations and outperforming existing methods in handling complex degradation scenarios.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) aims to recover high-quality images from diverse degradations within a unified framework. However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-RayZer is a self-supervised 3D vision model that learns 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled multi-view images through explicit 3D reconstruction, outperforming previous methods on 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised pre-training has transformed foundation models for languages, 2D images, and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. Current methods like RayZer infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis rather than operating directly in 3D space.

Method: E-RayZer performs self-supervised 3D reconstruction with explicit geometry directly in 3D space, eliminating shortcut solutions. It introduces a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an unsupervised manner to ensure convergence and scalability.

Result: E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models like VGGT. Its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks.

Conclusion: E-RayZer establishes a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training by learning truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images through explicit 3D reconstruction, demonstrating superior performance on 3D tasks compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.

TL;DR: Group Diffusion enables collaborative image generation by sharing attention across multiple images during inference, achieving significant FID improvements through cross-sample attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous diffusion models generate images independently at inference, missing potential benefits from collaborative generation. The authors explore whether samples can be generated collaboratively to improve quality.

Method: Proposes Group Diffusion which unlocks attention mechanisms to be shared across images rather than just within single images. Enables joint denoising of multiple images at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence.

Result: Shows clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Introduces qualitative measure that correlates with FID.

Conclusion: Cross-sample inference is an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling that enables collaborative generation and significant quality improvements.

Abstract: In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.

TL;DR: Omni-Attribute is a new open-vocabulary image attribute encoder that learns disentangled, attribute-specific representations to enable precise visual concept personalization without information leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual concept personalization methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate single attributes, leading to information leakage and incoherent synthesis.

Method: Joint data-model design: (i) curating semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive/negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; (ii) adopting a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement.

Result: The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-Attribute successfully addresses the limitation of entangled representations in existing methods by providing high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations for precise visual concept personalization.

Abstract: Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoWalker improves robot navigation foundation models by using stereo vision and explicit mid-level vision modules instead of relying solely on monocular vision, achieving better performance with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation foundation models rely on monocular vision and ignore mid-level vision modules, assuming vision capabilities will emerge implicitly. This requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that's difficult to obtain, especially in dynamic/unstructured settings where precise geometric understanding is needed. Monocular views have depth-scale ambiguity that limits spatial reasoning.

Method: StereoWalker augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules including depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Stereo inputs resolve depth-scale ambiguity, while modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure. The authors also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos.

Result: Mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of training data, and surpasses state-of-the-art using full data. Stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

Conclusion: Relying solely on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient for navigation foundation models. Incorporating stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules provides significant performance improvements and data efficiency.

Abstract: The success of foundation models in language and vision motivated research in fully end-to-end robot navigation foundation models (NFMs). NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.
  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.

TL;DR: WorldLens is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating generative world models in embodied AI, assessing visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability across five dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative world models for driving environments often produce visually convincing but physically or behaviorally unrealistic worlds, lacking unified evaluation methods to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control.

Method: WorldLens introduces a full-spectrum benchmark spanning five aspects: Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference. It includes WorldLens-26K (large-scale human-annotated dataset with scores and rationales) and WorldLens-Agent (evaluation model distilled from human annotations for scalable, explainable scoring).

Result: The benchmark reveals that no existing world model excels universally across all dimensions - models with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. The framework provides standardized evaluation across visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability.

Conclusion: WorldLens creates a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity, standardizing how future generative world models are judged not only by visual appearance but also by behavioral realism and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Generative world models are reshaping embodied AI, enabling agents to synthesize realistic 4D driving environments that look convincing but often fail physically or behaviorally. Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.

TL;DR: StereoSpace is a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that uses viewpoint conditioning instead of explicit depth or warping, achieving state-of-the-art results with a novel evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stereo generation methods rely on explicit depth estimation or warping operations, which can be limited in handling complex scenes with disocclusions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and layered geometry. The authors aim to develop a more robust, depth-free approach that can handle challenging scenes while ensuring fair evaluation.

Method: StereoSpace uses a diffusion-based framework with viewpoint conditioning to model geometry implicitly. It operates in a canonical rectified space where the conditioning guides the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. The method avoids explicit depth estimation or warping operations entirely.

Result: StereoSpace outperforms other methods from warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories. It achieves sharp parallax and strong robustness on both layered and non-Lambertian scenes. The method establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

Conclusion: Viewpoint-conditioned diffusion provides an effective, scalable alternative to depth-based stereo generation methods, offering better handling of complex scenes and disocclusions while maintaining geometric consistency and perceptual comfort.

Abstract: We introduce StereoSpace, a diffusion-based framework for monocular-to-stereo synthesis that models geometry purely through viewpoint conditioning, without explicit depth or warping. A canonical rectified space and the conditioning guide the generator to infer correspondences and fill disocclusions end-to-end. To ensure fair and leakage-free evaluation, we introduce an end-to-end protocol that excludes any ground truth or proxy geometry estimates at test time. The protocol emphasizes metrics reflecting downstream relevance: iSQoE for perceptual comfort and MEt3R for geometric consistency. StereoSpace surpasses other methods from the warp & inpaint, latent-warping, and warped-conditioning categories, achieving sharp parallax and strong robustness on layered and non-Lambertian scenes. This establishes viewpoint-conditioned diffusion as a scalable, depth-free solution for stereo generation.

### [94] [What Kind of Reasoning (if any) is an LLM actually doing? On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10080)
*Luciano Floridi,Jessica Morley,Claudio Novelli,David Watson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs appear to perform abductive reasoning but actually generate text based on learned patterns from human texts, lacking true understanding, verification, or grounding in truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how token-completion LLMs create the appearance of abductive reasoning despite their stochastic nature, and to understand the implications of this dual nature for evaluation and application.

Method: Analyzes the stochastic nature of LLMs and their similarity to human abductive reasoning, using examples to demonstrate how they produce plausible ideas and explanatory answers without actual reasoning capabilities.

Result: LLMs generate text based on learned patterns from human-generated texts containing reasoning structures, creating the appearance of abductive reasoning without truth, semantics, verification, or understanding.

Conclusion: LLMs can assist with idea generation and support human thinking, but their outputs require critical assessment as they cannot identify truth or verify explanations; the article addresses objections and limitations while providing overall evaluation.

Abstract: This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.

*Yumou Wei,John Stamper,Paulo F. Carvalho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs can generate high-quality educational questions using a "generate-then-validate" pipeline with probabilistic reasoning, performing comparably to human and LLM evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore small language models (SLMs) as an alternative to large language models for automatic question generation in learning analytics, leveraging SLMs' text generation and probabilistic reasoning capabilities.

Method: A novel question generation pipeline using SLMs with a "generate-then-validate" strategy: first expansive generation of candidate questions, then selective validation through probabilistic reasoning to refine them.

Result: Two evaluation studies (human experts and LLM) showed most judges agreed generated questions had clear answers and aligned well with learning objectives, demonstrating SLMs can produce high-quality questions.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively generate high-quality educational questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages their strengths in text generation and probabilistic reasoning.

Abstract: We explore the use of small language models (SLMs) for automatic question generation as a complement to the prevalent use of their large counterparts in learning analytics research. We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a "generate-then-validate" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.

*Zhongjie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepNews Framework addresses the "impossible trinity" in long-form text generation by modeling expert cognitive processes, achieving 25% acceptance rate vs 0% for SOTA models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face an "impossible trinity" - they cannot simultaneously achieve low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression in vertical domains like financial journalism, due to the Statistical Smoothing Trap that overlooks expert cognitive processes.

Method: Proposed DeepNews Framework with three core modules: 1) dual-granularity retrieval with 10:1 saturated information input ratio, 2) schema-guided strategic planning using domain expert knowledge bases and Atomic Blocks, 3) adversarial constraint prompting with tactics like Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt probabilistic smoothness.

Result: Identified Knowledge Cliff: truthfulness collapses below 15,000 characters of retrieved context, while high-redundancy input (>30,000 chars) stabilizes Hallucination-Free Rate above 85%. In blind test with Chinese tech media, DeepNews achieved 25% submission acceptance rate using DeepSeek-V3-0324, significantly outperforming GPT-5's 0% acceptance rate.

Conclusion: The DeepNews Framework successfully addresses the "impossible trinity" by explicitly modeling expert cognitive processes, demonstrating that agentic workflows can overcome Statistical Smoothing Trap and achieve practical success in real-world financial journalism applications.

Abstract: Central to long-form text generation in vertical domains is the "impossible trinity" confronting current large language models (LLMs): the simultaneous achievement of low hallucination, deep logical coherence, and personalized expression. This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%. In an ecological validity blind test conducted with a top-tier Chinese technology media outlet, the DeepNews system--built on a previous-generation model (DeepSeek-V3-0324)-achieved a 25% submission acceptance rate, significantly outperforming the 0% acceptance rate of zero-shot generation by a state-of-the-art (SOTA) model (GPT-5).

*Moonsoo Park,Jeongseok Yun,Bohyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage prompting framework that infers explicit and implicit personas from short reviews to generate personalized responses using LLMs, evaluated on Korean food delivery data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized review response generation is challenging when user information is limited (e.g., food delivery platforms). LLMs produce generic responses without contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness.

Method: Two-stage prompting framework: 1) infers explicit (user-stated preferences) and implicit (demographic/stylistic cues) personas from short review texts, 2) incorporates these persona attributes into response generation prompts. Uses temperature adjustment during decoding to encourage diverse yet faithful generations.

Result: Evaluated on real-world dataset from Korean food delivery app, showing effectiveness in enhancing precision, diversity, and semantic consistency of responses.

Conclusion: Persona-augmented prompting effectively enhances relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Personalized review response generation presents a significant challenge in domains where user information is limited, such as food delivery platforms. While large language models (LLMs) offer powerful text generation capabilities, they often produce generic responses when lacking contextual user data, reducing engagement and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a two-stage prompting framework that infers both explicit (e.g., user-stated preferences) and implicit (e.g., demographic or stylistic cues) personas directly from short review texts. These inferred persona attributes are then incorporated into the response generation prompt to produce user-tailored replies. To encourage diverse yet faithful generations, we adjust decoding temperature during inference. We evaluate our method using a real-world dataset collected from a Korean food delivery app, and assess its impact on precision, diversity, and semantic consistency. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of persona-augmented prompting in enhancing the relevance and personalization of automated responses without requiring model fine-tuning.

*Gyutaek Oh,Sangjoon Park,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMedic is a multi-agent simulation framework that transforms static medical QA datasets into virtual patient profiles for automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents using the CARE metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation in medicine relies on static QA benchmarks, lacking assessment of dynamic, interactive clinical conversations and comprehensive multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy.

Method: AutoMedic transforms existing static medical QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. It uses the CARE metric for evaluation across four dimensions: Clinical conversational Accuracy, Efficiency/strategy, Empathy, and Robustness.

Result: The framework demonstrates validity as an automated evaluation system for clinical conversational agents, with findings validated by human experts. It provides practical guidelines for developing LLMs in conversational medical applications.

Conclusion: AutoMedic addresses the limitations of static medical QA benchmarks by enabling automated, comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in dynamic clinical conversation scenarios, offering a standardized approach to assess clinical conversational agents.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.

### [99] [Multilingual VLM Training: Adapting an English-Trained VLM to French](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10336)
*Jules Lahmi,Alexis Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores methods for adapting English-trained Vision-Language Models to other languages, comparing translation-based pipelines, LoRA finetuning, and two-stage finetuning strategies, finding that dataset translation quality is a major bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly English-based, limiting accessibility for non-English speakers. There's a need to extend VLM capabilities to multiple languages to increase global accessibility and utility.

Method: The paper compares three adaptation methods: 1) translation-based pipeline, 2) LoRA finetuning, and 3) two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. Evaluation uses translated multimodal benchmarks and manual assessments by native experts.

Result: Dataset translation emerges as the major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limitations affecting both training effectiveness and evaluation accuracy. Translation quality significantly impacts model adaptation outcomes.

Conclusion: Future efforts should prioritize native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies rather than relying solely on translation-based approaches, as data quality is critical for effective multilingual VLM adaptation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made great progress in recent years, particularly in the development of Vision--Language Models (VLMs) that understand both visual and textual data. However, these advancements remain largely limited to English, reducing their accessibility for non--English speakers. It is essential to extend these capabilities to a broader range of languages. This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts. The results reveal that dataset translation remains a major bottleneck in multilingual VLM performance, with data quality limiting the effectiveness of training and evaluation. These findings suggest that future efforts should focus on native-language dataset collection and improved translation strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Confucius Code Agent (CCA) is an open-source AI software engineer that achieves state-of-the-art performance (54.3% on SWE-Bench-Pro) while addressing industrial-scale requirements like massive repository reasoning, durable memory, and robust toolchain coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source coding agents lack industrial-scale capabilities, while proprietary agents offer performance but lack extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. There's a need for transparent, extensible AI agents that bridge research prototypes and production systems.

Method: Built on Confucius SDK with three perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). Features include hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, persistent note-taking for cross-session learning, modular extension for tool use, and a meta-agent for automated configuration synthesis and refinement.

Result: CCA achieves state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3% on SWE-Bench-Pro, substantially improving over prior coding agents and demonstrating industrial-scale capabilities.

Conclusion: Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, reproducible foundation for AI agents that bridges gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, supporting industrial-scale agent development and deployment.

Abstract: Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.

### [101] [Sliding Window Attention Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10411)
*Yijiong Yu,Jiale Liu,Qingyun Wu,Huazheng Wang,Ji Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FA-pretrained LLMs can be adapted to sliding window attention (SWA) without pretraining using specific synergistic combinations of five methods, effectively recovering original long-context performance while maintaining linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic scaling of self-attention in Transformers makes long-context inference expensive. While sliding window attention reduces this to linear complexity, naively applying SWA to models pretrained with full attention causes severe performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch.

Method: Proposes Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA) with five practical methods: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling, (2) preserving "sink" tokens, (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers, (4) chain-of-thought (CoT), and (5) fine-tuning.

Result: SWA adaptation is feasible but non-trivial: no single method suffices, but specific synergistic combinations effectively recover original long-context performance. The paper analyzes performance-efficiency trade-offs and provides recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: FA-pretrained LLMs can be successfully adapted to SWA without pretraining through carefully designed combinations of adaptation methods, offering practical solutions for efficient long-context inference while maintaining performance.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) scales quadratically with input length, making long-context inference expensive. Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving "sink" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

*Youmin Ko,Sungjong Seo,Hyunjoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoopRAG is a cooperative RAG framework where retriever and LLM work together through knowledge exchange, using sub-question unrolling, masked reasoning chains, document retrieval/reranking, and chain reconstruction to improve QA accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods for QA are prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations despite being designed to mitigate LLMs' factual inaccuracies. There's a need for more robust QA systems that can better handle both simple and multi-hop questions.

Method: Four-step cooperative framework: 1) Unroll questions into sub-questions with masked reasoning chains, 2) Retrieve documents using augmented queries, 3) Rerank documents by contrasting retriever layers, 4) Reconstruct reasoning chains by filling masked positions via LLM.

Result: CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets and one simple QA dataset, achieving improvements in both retrieval and QA performance metrics.

Conclusion: The cooperative approach between retriever and LLM, along with intra-retriever layer cooperation, effectively addresses retrieval errors and hallucinations in RAG systems, leading to superior QA performance across different question complexities.

Abstract: Since large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to generate factually inaccurate output, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained significant attention as a key means to mitigate this downside of harnessing only LLMs. However, existing RAG methods for simple and multi-hop question answering (QA) are still prone to incorrect retrievals and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances. Our code is available.\footnote{https://github.com/meaningful96/CoopRAG}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRAP framework detects adversarial plagiarism using statistical anomaly detection and semantic reconstruction to recover original terminology from obfuscated scientific text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific literature faces threats from automated paraphrasing tools that generate "tortured phrases" to mask plagiarism. Existing detection methods rely on static blocklists or general-domain models, suffering from high false-negative rates and inability to determine source documents.

Method: Two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection using domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) with token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT).

Result: Achieves 23.67% restoration accuracy on parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text, significantly outperforming zero-shot baselines (0.00% restoration accuracy). Demonstrates static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text.

Conclusion: SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents, providing a framework for detecting and recovering original terminology from adversarial plagiarism in scientific literature.

Abstract: The integrity and reliability of scientific literature is facing a serious threat by adversarial text generation techniques, specifically from the use of automated paraphrasing tools to mask plagiarism. These tools generate "tortured phrases", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. "counterfeit consciousness" for "artificial intelligence"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.

Motivation: To create an educational conversational agent that goes beyond traditional tutoring or affective support by simultaneously addressing both learning performance and emotional well-being, overcoming limitations of prior chatbots that focused on only one aspect.

Method: Combines Large Language Models (LLMs), knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and bidirectional LSTM with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time using multimodal data including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends.

Result: Pilot study with university students showed improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The integration of semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling shows promise for creating adaptive, student-centered educational interventions that simultaneously support learning and emotional well-being.

Abstract: This paper presents a psychologically-aware conversational agent designed to enhance both learning performance and emotional well-being in educational settings. The system combines Large Language Models (LLMs), a knowledge graph-enhanced BERT (KG-BERT), and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to classify students' cognitive and affective states in real time. Unlike prior chatbots limited to either tutoring or affective support, our approach leverages multimodal data-including textual semantics, prosodic speech features, and temporal behavioral trends-to infer engagement, stress, and conceptual understanding. A pilot study with university students demonstrated improved motivation, reduced stress, and moderate academic gains compared to baseline methods. These results underline the promise of integrating semantic reasoning, multimodal fusion, and temporal modeling to support adaptive, student-centered educational interventions.

*Lars G. B. Johnsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs trained only on surface forms demonstrate sensitivity to syntactic structure by distinguishing grammatical from ungrammatical variants in classic constructions like subject-auxiliary inversion and parasitic gap licensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models, trained only on surface forms without explicit syntactic knowledge, develop sensitivity to syntactic structure as evidenced by their ability to reproduce systematic grammaticality contrasts that traditional generative grammar uses as evidence for hierarchical structure.

Method: Focus on two classic syntactic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing subject boundary recognition) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). Evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts that elicit acceptability ratings for grammatical and ungrammatical variants.

Result: LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, showing sensitivity to syntactic structure rather than just linear order. The models reproduce systematic grammaticality contrasts that imply underlying structural representations.

Conclusion: Structural generalizations emerge from predictive training on surface forms alone, suggesting that LLMs develop functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding of grammatical rules. This supports the idea that syntactic structure sensitivity can emerge from statistical patterns in language data.

Abstract: What counts as evidence for syntactic structure? In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.
  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order. Structural generalizations, distinct from cognitive knowledge, emerge from predictive training on surface forms, suggesting functional sensitivity to syntax without explicit encoding.

### [108] [XDoGE: Multilingual Data Reweighting to Enhance Language Inclusivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10545)
*Iñaki Lacunza,José Javier Saiz,Alexander Shvets,Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre,Marta Villegas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes XDoGE, a method to optimize language distribution in multilingual LLM training by reweighting data for underrepresented languages, and releases IberianLLM-7B-Instruct focused on Iberian languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are trained primarily on high-resource languages like English, which hampers their performance in mid- and low-resource languages. There's a need to address this imbalance to improve multilingual capabilities.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) Optimize language distribution using XDoGE (extended DoGE algorithm) with a small proxy model to determine optimal weights, (2) Rescale data and train full-size models using these weights, either from scratch or via continual pre-training. Applied to six languages with varying resource levels.

Result: Investigated effects of data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using IberoBench framework. Released IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model pretrained from scratch and improved via continual pre-training with XDoGE weights.

Conclusion: The proposed XDoGE method effectively addresses language imbalance in LLM training, resulting in improved performance for underrepresented languages. The released IberianLLM-7B-Instruct demonstrates the practical benefits of this approach for Iberian languages.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of text data, primarily from a few dominant languages. Studies suggest that this over-reliance on high-resource languages, such as English, hampers LLM performance in mid- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to (i) optimize the language distribution by training a small proxy model within a domain-reweighing DoGE algorithm that we extend to XDoGE for a multilingual setup, and (ii) rescale the data and train a full-size model with the established language weights either from scratch or within a continual pre-training phase (CPT). We target six languages possessing a variety of geographic and intra- and inter-language-family relations, namely, English and Spanish (high-resource), Portuguese and Catalan (mid-resource), Galician and Basque (low-resource). We experiment with Salamandra-2b, which is a promising model for these languages. We investigate the effects of substantial data repetition on minor languages and under-sampling on dominant languages using the IberoBench framework for quantitative evaluation. Finally, we release a new promising IberianLLM-7B-Instruct model centering on Iberian languages and English that we pretrained from scratch and further improved using CPT with the XDoGE weights.

### [109] [Causal Reasoning Favors Encoders: On The Limits of Decoder-Only Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10561)
*Amartya Roy,Elamparithy M,Kripabandhu Ghosh,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Adrian de Wynter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning; encoder/encoder-decoder models with fine-tuning outperform decoder-only models for robust causal reasoning at smaller scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The role and performance of in-context learning (ICL) in causal reasoning remains unclear, especially since causal reasoning requires multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and can be misled by spurious lexical relations in inputs.

Method: Compare fine-tuned versions of encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures with zero and few-shot ICL in both natural language and non-natural language scenarios to evaluate causal reasoning capabilities.

Result: ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. Decoder-only models are brittle to distributional shifts, while fine-tuned encoder and encoder-decoder models generalize more robustly across tests, including non-natural language scenarios. Decoder-only architectures only match or surpass these at large scales.

Conclusion: For cost-effective, short-horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder-decoder architectures with targeted fine-tuning are preferable over decoder-only models.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) underpins recent advances in large language models (LLMs), although its role and performance in causal reasoning remains unclear. Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features. In particular, decoder only models are noticeably brittle to distributional shifts, while finetuned encoder and encoder decoder models can generalize more robustly across our tests, including the non natural language split. Both architectures are only matched or surpassed by decoder only architectures at large scales. We conclude by noting that for cost effective, short horizon robust causal reasoning, encoder or encoder decoder architectures with targeted finetuning are preferable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoleRMBench is the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, revealing gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, with RoleRM (using Continuous Implicit Preferences) achieving 24% better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models degrade severely in subjective, open-ended domains like role play, failing to capture nuanced persona-grounded human judgments, creating a need for specialized evaluation and improvement in role-playing dialogue alignment.

Method: Introduces RoleRMBench benchmark covering seven fine-grained capabilities for role-playing dialogue evaluation, and proposes RoleRM reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP) that reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies.

Result: Evaluation shows large gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, especially in narrative and stylistic dimensions. RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, with substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: Continuous preference representation and annotation consistency are crucial for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems, establishing a foundation for better reward modeling in role-playing domains.

Abstract: Reward modeling has become a cornerstone of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet, when extended to subjective and open-ended domains such as role play, existing reward models exhibit severe degradation, struggling to capture nuanced and persona-grounded human judgments. To address this gap, we introduce RoleRMBench, the first systematic benchmark for reward modeling in role-playing dialogue, covering seven fine-grained capabilities from narrative management to role consistency and engagement. Evaluation on RoleRMBench reveals large and consistent gaps between general-purpose reward models and human judgment, particularly in narrative and stylistic dimensions. We further propose RoleRM, a reward model trained with Continuous Implicit Preferences (CIP), which reformulates subjective evaluation as continuous consistent pairwise supervision under multiple structuring strategies. Comprehensive experiments show that RoleRM surpasses strong open- and closed-source reward models by over 24% on average, demonstrating substantial gains in narrative coherence and stylistic fidelity. Our findings highlight the importance of continuous preference representation and annotation consistency, establishing a foundation for subjective alignment in human-centered dialogue systems.

TL;DR: AgriGPT-Omni is an agricultural omni-framework integrating speech, vision, and text with multilingual support, addressing data scarcity through synthetic data generation and achieving superior performance on multimodal agricultural tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural AI applications face three key constraints: lack of multilingual speech data, absence of unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Three-stage approach: 1) Scalable data synthesis pipeline creating 492K synthetic + 1.4K real speech samples across 6 languages; 2) Three-stage training: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning; 3) AgriBench-Omni-2K benchmark with standardized protocols for evaluation.

Result: AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning tasks as well as real-world speech understanding. The framework includes the largest agricultural speech dataset to date and comprehensive evaluation tools.

Conclusion: The proposed AgriGPT-Omni framework successfully addresses agricultural AI limitations through unified multimodal architecture, multilingual support, and comprehensive benchmarking, promoting reproducible research and inclusive agricultural intelligence for low-resource regions.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural applications remain constrained by the lack of multilingual speech data, unified multimodal architectures, and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.

### [112] [From Data Scarcity to Data Care: Reimagining Language Technologies for Serbian and other Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10630)
*Smiljana Antonijevic Ubois*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how AI development for low-resource languages like Serbian reproduces cultural biases, proposes a Data Care framework based on CARE principles to address these issues, and positions it as a model for inclusive language technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses how large language models trained on dominant languages like English fail to adequately represent low-resource languages, reproducing cultural and linguistic biases. Using Serbian as a case study, it examines structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors that shape language technology development for such languages in the AI age.

Method: The research employs qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners (linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers). It analyzes challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage and contemporary issues driving reductive, engineering-first approaches.

Result: The study identifies key challenges: superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. It traces these issues to historical factors like destruction of Serbian textual heritage and contemporary pressures for functional solutions over linguistic nuance.

Conclusion: The paper proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), which reframes bias mitigation from a post-hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance. This serves as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Abstract: Large language models are commonly trained on dominant languages like English, and their representation of low resource languages typically reflects cultural and linguistic biases present in the source language materials. Using the Serbian language as a case, this study examines the structural, historical, and sociotechnical factors shaping language technology development for low resource languages in the AI age. Drawing on semi structured interviews with ten scholars and practitioners, including linguists, digital humanists, and AI developers, it traces challenges rooted in historical destruction of Serbian textual heritage, intensified by contemporary issues that drive reductive, engineering first approaches prioritizing functionality over linguistic nuance. These include superficial transliteration, reliance on English-trained models, data bias, and dataset curation lacking cultural specificity. To address these challenges, the study proposes Data Care, a framework grounded in CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics), that reframes bias mitigation from a post hoc technical fix to an integral component of corpus design, annotation, and governance, and positions Data Care as a replicable model for building inclusive, sustainable, and culturally grounded language technologies in contexts where traditional LLM development reproduces existing power imbalances and cultural blind spots.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a comprehensive pipeline for detecting and mitigating two types of data bias (representation bias and explicit stereotypes) in LLM training data, with evaluation showing successful data debiasing but inconsistent model bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM training data exhibits multifaceted bias including harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations like the European AI Act require bias mitigation, but practical guidance and operationalization are lacking.

Method: Four-component pipeline: 1) LLM-generated word lists for group label detection, 2) Demographic Representation Score for representation bias quantification, 3) Sociolinguistically informed filtering for stereotype detection/mitigation, 4) Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation for representation bias compensation.

Result: Successfully reduces representation bias and explicit stereotypes in text datasets. However, LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, revealing gaps in current evaluation methodologies.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively debiases data but highlights that data debiasing alone doesn't guarantee model bias reduction, exposing critical gaps in evaluation methods and emphasizing need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

Abstract: Textual data used to train large language models (LLMs) exhibits multifaceted bias manifestations encompassing harmful language and skewed demographic distributions. Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.

TL;DR: OPV is a novel verifier that combines outcome-based and process-based verification to efficiently check reasoning chains in LLMs, using active learning to reduce annotation costs while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verifiers have limitations: outcome-based verifiers (OVs) can't inspect intermediate reasoning steps, while process-based verifiers (PVs) struggle with complex long reasoning chains due to high annotation costs and limited training data.

Method: Proposed Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV) verifies summarized outcomes from long reasoning chains. Uses iterative active learning with expert annotations, employing Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR to progressively improve verification with fewer annotations.

Result: OPV achieves SOTA results on their benchmark (F1 score 83.1 vs 76.3 for Qwen3-Max-Preview). Effectively detects false positives in synthetic data and improves policy model performance (e.g., raising DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B accuracy from 55.2% to 73.3% on AIME2025).

Conclusion: OPV provides an accurate and efficient verification approach that combines strengths of both outcome and process verification, enabling large-scale annotation with reduced costs while significantly improving reasoning verification performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in solving complex reasoning tasks by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \textbf{O}utcome-based \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out \textsc{\thisbench}, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3. Furthermore, OPV effectively detects false positives within synthetic dataset, closely align with expert assessment. When collaborating with policy models, OPV consistently yields performance gains, e.g., raising the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 55.2\% to 73.3\% on AIME2025 as the compute budget scales.

### [115] [TRIDENT: A Redundant Architecture for Caribbean-Accented Emergency Speech Triage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10741)
*Elroy Galbraith,Chadwick Sutherland,Donahue Morgan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a three-layer dispatcher-support system for emergency call centers that handles Caribbean accent challenges by combining accent-tuned ASR, LLM-based entity extraction, and bio-acoustic distress detection to ensure equitable access to triage protocols even when ASR fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency speech recognition systems degrade on non-standard English varieties, creating critical service gaps for Caribbean populations. Current ASR systems fail to handle Caribbean accents effectively, potentially delaying emergency response and violating equitable access principles.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR with confidence scoring, 2) Local entity extraction using large language models to capture clinical indicators, 3) Bio-acoustic distress detection for vocal stress indicators. Key insight: low ASR confidence serves as queue prioritization signal when combined with vocal distress markers.

Result: The paper presents architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline disaster scenarios. Establishes framework for accent-resilient emergency AI but notes empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

Conclusion: TRIDENT provides a framework for equitable emergency response by ensuring Caribbean voices receive access to established national triage protocols (ESI for routine, START for mass casualty) even when automatic speech recognition fails, addressing both linguistic and paralinguistic emergency indicators.

Abstract: Emergency speech recognition systems exhibit systematic performance degradation on non-standard English varieties, creating a critical gap in services for Caribbean populations. We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.
  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.
  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios. This work establishes a framework for accent-resilient emergency AI that ensures Caribbean voices receive equitable access to established national triage protocols. Empirical validation on Caribbean emergency calls remains future work.

*Kevin Glocker,Kätriin Kukk,Romina Oji,Marcel Bollmann,Marco Kuhlmann,Jenny Kunz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaling English base models before language adaptation is more data-efficient than continued pretraining, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and enables better multilingual merging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual models underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially for medium- and lower-resource languages at smaller scales. Need efficient strategies for adapting pretrained models to new languages.

Method: Comprehensive scaling ablations with FLOP-matched models: upscaling English base models vs. standard continued pretraining on target languages. Test scaling as adaptation strategy and explore merging scaled language-specific models for multilingual systems.

Result: Larger upscaled models match/surpass smaller continually pretrained models with less target-language data, showing scaling benefits for data efficiency. Scaling preserves English capabilities (reduces forgetting). Merging scaled models performs better than smaller merges but still less effective than joint multilingual training.

Conclusion: Scaling before language adaptation is an efficient strategy for multilingual adaptation. It improves data efficiency, reduces catastrophic forgetting, and enables better modular multilingual systems through merging, though merging methods need improvement for language-level integration.

Abstract: Achieving high-performing language models which include medium- and lower-resource languages remains a challenge. Massively multilingual models still underperform compared to language-specific adaptations, especially at smaller model scales. In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones. We observe large performance differences across merging methods, suggesting potential for improvement through merging approaches specialized for language-level integration.

TL;DR: LLMs show significant performance degradation (5-12 F1 points) when processing romanized Indian language text vs native scripts in maternal healthcare triage, potentially causing ~2 million excess errors in real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes clinical applications in India where users frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, but existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data.

Method: Benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali, comparing performance between romanized and native script versions of the same content.

Result: Consistent performance degradation for romanized messages with F1 scores trailing native scripts by 5-12 points. At a partner maternal health organization, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. The performance gap is not due to failure in clinical reasoning - LLMs often correctly infer semantic intent but final classification outputs remain brittle to orthographic noise.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably, highlighting the need for better handling of orthographic variations in real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes clinical applications in India. In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.

Conclusion: The FACTS Leaderboard Suite offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework for measuring language models' factuality across diverse scenarios, enabling robust benchmarking while maintaining integrity through public/private splits.

Abstract: We introduce The FACTS Leaderboard, an online leaderboard suite and associated set of benchmarks that comprehensively evaluates the ability of language models to generate factually accurate text across diverse scenarios. The suite provides a holistic measure of factuality by aggregating the performance of models on four distinct sub-leaderboards: (1) FACTS Multimodal, which measures the factuality of responses to image-based questions; (2) FACTS Parametric, which assesses models' world knowledge by answering closed-book factoid questions from internal parameters; (3) FACTS Search, which evaluates factuality in information-seeking scenarios, where the model must use a search API; and (4) FACTS Grounding (v2), which evaluates whether long-form responses are grounded in provided documents, featuring significantly improved judge models. Each sub-leaderboard employs automated judge models to score model responses, and the final suite score is an average of the four components, designed to provide a robust and balanced assessment of a model's overall factuality. The FACTS Leaderboard Suite will be actively maintained, containing both public and private splits to allow for external participation while guarding its integrity. It can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/benchmarks/google/facts .

*Michael Schlee,Christoph Weisser,Timo Kivimäki,Melchizedek Mashiku,Benjamin Saefken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LabelFusion is an ensemble method that combines traditional transformer classifiers with LLMs for text classification, using a fusion MLP to integrate embeddings and LLM scores for improved accuracy with cost-awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complementary strengths of traditional transformer-based classifiers and Large Language Models for text classification, enabling robust performance while managing practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

Method: Concatenates transformer embeddings with LLM-derived per-class scores from structured prompt-engineering, then feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) for final prediction.

Result: Achieves 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification, demonstrating robust performance across domains.

Conclusion: LabelFusion effectively combines LLM reasoning with traditional classifiers through learned fusion, delivering accurate predictions while enabling practical accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: LabelFusion is a fusion ensemble for text classification that learns to combine a traditional transformer-based classifier (e.g., RoBERTa) with one or more Large Language Models (LLMs such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek) to deliver accurate and cost-aware predictions across multi-class and multi-label tasks. The package provides a simple high-level interface (AutoFusionClassifier) that trains the full pipeline end-to-end with minimal configuration, and a flexible API for advanced users. Under the hood, LabelFusion integrates vector signals from both sources by concatenating the ML backbone's embeddings with the LLM-derived per-class scores -- obtained through structured prompt-engineering strategies -- and feeds this joint representation into a compact multi-layer perceptron (FusionMLP) that produces the final prediction. This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.

### [121] [Unsupervised Acquisition of Discrete Grammatical Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18702)
*David Ph. Shakouri,Crit Cremers,Niels O. Schiller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A computational multi-agent system demonstrates language acquisition where a daughter agent learns grammatical categories from mother agent's utterances through statistical analysis and clustering, establishing acquisition of non-trivial grammatical knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how abstract grammatical knowledge can be acquired through computational modeling of language learning, specifically examining how statistical patterns in input data can yield discrete grammatical rules without access to internal knowledge of the language model.

Method: Implemented a multi-agent system with adult (mother) and daughter language models; daughter learns only from mother's generated exemplars; used hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis on mother's utterances to identify grammatical patterns; rules derived from statistical analyses were added to daughter's grammatical knowledge.

Result: Successfully acquired abstract grammatical knowledge resembling linguists' categories for natural languages; established non-trivial grammatical acquisition; parameter configuration validated with test set showing consistent acquisition of categories.

Conclusion: Computational laboratory environment demonstrates effective language acquisition through statistical analysis of input patterns, enabling acquisition of grammatical categories without access to internal model knowledge, validated across training and test data.

Abstract: This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

*Akaash Chatterjee,Suman Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ExaCraft is an AI system that generates personalized educational examples by adapting to learners' dynamic context, including their struggles, mastery patterns, and progression, using Google Gemini AI and a Chrome extension interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: System generates culturally relevant examples tailored to individual learning needs. Examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns.

Conclusion: ExaCraft demonstrates an innovative approach to personalized education through dynamic example generation that adapts to learners' evolving context and needs.

Abstract: Learning is most effective when it's connected to relevant, relatable examples that resonate with learners on a personal level. However, existing educational AI tools don't focus on generating examples or adapting to learners' changing understanding, struggles, or growing skills. We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals. Our demonstration will show how ExaCraft's examples evolve from basic concepts to advanced technical implementations, responding to topic repetition, regeneration requests, and topic progression patterns in different use cases.

*Maya Grace Torii,Takahito Murakami,Shuka Koseki,Yoichi Ochiai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an "Embodied Information Hub" called Suzume-chan, a soft AI agent that uses physical presence and conversational interaction to create a sense of connection for knowledge sharing, addressing the gap between digital information access and human connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital tools provide information access but lack the human connection needed for deep understanding. The paper aims to bridge this gap by creating a system that combines the accessibility of digital tools with the warmth and connection of human communication.

Method: The researchers developed Suzume-chan, a small, soft AI agent that runs locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, using physical embodiment and conversational interaction to reduce psychological distance.

Result: The prototype creates a system that makes knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered by reducing psychological distance through embodied presence and conversational interaction, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The Embodied Information Hub represents a new approach to knowledge sharing that combines physical presence with conversational AI to create meaningful human connections, addressing limitations of traditional digital tools through Social Presence Theory principles.

Abstract: Access to expert knowledge often requires real-time human communication. Digital tools improve access to information but rarely create the sense of connection needed for deep understanding. This study addresses this issue using Social Presence Theory, which explains how a feeling of "being together" enhances communication. An "Embodied Information Hub" is proposed as a new way to share knowledge through physical and conversational interaction. The prototype, Suzume-chan, is a small, soft AI agent running locally with a language model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It learns from spoken explanations and responds through dialogue, reducing psychological distance and making knowledge sharing warmer and more human-centered.

*Chih-Han Chen,Chen-Han Tsai,Yu-Shao Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: first uses LLMs to compute agreement scores on evidence, then triggers multi-agent debate when consensus is insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation is proliferating online, requiring both high-quality evidence retrieval and rigorous reasoning for effective verification.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Agreement Score Prediction using LLMs to evaluate retrieved articles and compute aggregated evidence stance; 2) Multi-Agent Debate triggered when agreement score falls below threshold, where multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence.

Result: The two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning is valuable for complex verification tasks in health misinformation detection.

Abstract: Fact-checking health-related claims has become increasingly critical as misinformation proliferates online. Effective verification requires both the retrieval of high-quality evidence and rigorous reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework for health misinformation detection: Agreement Score Prediction followed by Multi-Agent Debate. In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance. When this score indicates insufficient consensus-falling below a predefined threshold-the system proceeds to a second stage. Multiple agents engage in structured debate to synthesize conflicting evidence and generate well-reasoned verdicts with explicit justifications. Experimental results demonstrate that our two-stage approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods, highlighting the value of combining automated scoring with collaborative reasoning for complex verification tasks.

*Moein Heidari,Mohammad Amin Roohi,Armin Khosravi,Ilker Hacihaliloglu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Echo-CoPilot is an AI agent that uses a large language model to coordinate multiple specialized tools for comprehensive echocardiography analysis, outperforming existing models on clinical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current echocardiography foundation models operate in isolation on individual subtasks (view classification, segmentation, disease prediction) but lack unified, clinically coherent assessment capabilities needed for comprehensive cardiovascular care.

Method: A multi-view, multi-task agent using a large language model to orchestrate specialized echocardiography tools in a ReAct-style loop. It decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement, disease prediction, and report synthesis, then integrates outputs into guideline-aware answers.

Result: Achieved 50.8% accuracy on the MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analysis shows effective use of quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging borderline cases.

Conclusion: Echo-CoPilot demonstrates that orchestrating specialized echocardiography tools through a language model can provide unified, clinically coherent assessments, potentially reducing cognitive burden in echocardiography interpretation while maintaining guideline compliance.

Abstract: Echocardiography is central to contemporary cardiovascular care, but full-study interpretation remains a cognitively demanding, multi-view task that is still performed manually. While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: SciEx is a modular framework for extracting fine-grained information from scientific literature using LLMs, addressing challenges of long documents, multi-modal content, and rapidly changing data schemas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based extraction tools struggle with scientific literature's complexities: long-context documents, multi-modal content, inconsistent information across publications, and rapidly changing extraction schemas that require frequent system re-architecture.

Method: SciEx uses a modular, composable framework that decouples PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation components, enabling flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms.

Result: Evaluated on datasets spanning three scientific topics, SciEx demonstrates accurate and consistent extraction of fine-grained information, providing insights into strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

Conclusion: SciEx offers a practical solution for on-demand scientific information extraction that is extensible and adaptable to changing requirements, while revealing both capabilities and constraints of existing LLM approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly touted as powerful tools for automating scientific information extraction. However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently. Our findings provide practical insights into both the strengths and limitations of current LLM-based pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaMate is an AI-powered multi-agent framework that automates molecular dynamics simulations for proteins and protein-ligand complexes, overcoming technical barriers in MD setup and enabling standardized, scalable drug discovery pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for studying biomolecular systems but require complex technical setup involving parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, creating barriers to widespread adoption in drug discovery and protein engineering.

Method: DynaMate uses a modular multi-agent framework with three specialized modules that plan experiments, perform simulations, and analyze results. It integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and self-correcting behavior to autonomously execute complete MD workflows including free energy binding affinity calculations with MM/PB(GB)SA methods.

Result: The framework was evaluated on twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions, demonstrating high success rates, efficiency, and adaptability.

Conclusion: DynaMate successfully automates protein-ligand MD workflows using agentic LLMs, paving the way for standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for biomolecular research and drug design applications.

Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for probing the structure, dynamics, and functions of biomolecular systems, including proteins and protein-ligand complexes. Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions. This automated framework paves the way toward standardized, scalable, and time-efficient molecular modeling pipelines for future biomolecular and drug design applications.

TL;DR: SWR is a photorealistic urban simulation platform for embodied AI with procedurally generated cities, dynamic elements, and multi-robot support, featuring two challenging benchmarks that expose limitations of current models in urban robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models for robotics focus mainly on indoor/household scenarios, lacking evaluation in complex urban environments with realistic challenges like pedestrians, traffic, and multi-agent collaboration.

Method: Built SimWorld-Robotics (SWR) on Unreal Engine 5 with procedurally generated photorealistic urban scenes, dynamic elements (pedestrians, traffic), multi-robot control, and communication capabilities. Created two benchmarks: multimodal instruction-following navigation and multi-agent search tasks.

Result: State-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with SWR tasks, showing deficiencies in robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities needed for urban environments, despite performing well on simpler indoor benchmarks.

Conclusion: SWR provides a realistic urban simulation platform that reveals critical gaps in current robotics AI, particularly in multimodal grounding, 3D spatial reasoning, safe navigation with dynamic elements, and multi-agent collaboration, pushing the field toward more capable urban robotics.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown promising results in developing generalist robotics that can perform diverse tasks in open-ended scenarios given multimodal inputs. However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.

*Logan Robbins*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PDT introduces a parallel decoder transformer with speculative note conditioning adapters that enable parallel decoding streams to coordinate via shared latent space, achieving 77.8% precision in coverage prediction without modifying base model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in LLMs creates latency bottlenecks that scale linearly with output length. Existing parallelization methods suffer from coherence drift due to lack of cross-stream communication between parallel generation streams.

Method: PDT injects lightweight Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC) adapters into a frozen pre-trained model, allowing parallel decoding streams to synchronize via shared dynamic latent space. Coordination is formulated as a speculative consensus problem where streams broadcast semantic "notes" to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head.

Result: PDT achieves 77.8% precision in coverage prediction and recovers approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights of a frozen 20B-parameter backbone, validated on a 50,000-step curriculum.

Conclusion: PDT establishes a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation by embedding coordination primitives directly into inference while keeping the base model frozen.

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) is inherently sequential, creating a latency bottleneck that scales linearly with output length. While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.
  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \textbf{77.8\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights. This establishes PDT as a scalable, efficient alternative to full model fine-tuning for structured parallel generation.

*Dani Roytburg,Beck Miller*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantitative study reveals deep structural divide between AI safety and AI ethics communities, with over 80% of collaborations occurring within silos and cross-field connectivity dependent on a small number of brokers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI alignment research has diverged into two parallel tracks (safety vs ethics) with different meanings of alignment, methodologies, and institutional homes, creating a conceptual and institutional split that hinders comprehensive AI alignment.

Method: Large-scale bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML/NLP conferences (2020-2025) to measure collaboration patterns and structural connections between safety and ethics communities.

Result: Over 80% of collaborations occur within either safety or ethics communities; cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated with ~5% of papers accounting for >85% of bridging links; removing key brokers sharply increases segregation.

Conclusion: The safety-ethics divide is both conceptual and institutional; integrating technical safety work with normative ethics through shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

Abstract: While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, "aligned" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.

*Paul Bouchaud,Pedro Ramaciotti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs develop linear representations of sociodemographic attributes (gender, race) from indirect cues like names and occupations, which actively shape downstream behavior like career recommendations, revealing implicit biases even in models that pass bias benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners from indirect cues, understand how these representations form, and examine their impact on downstream behavior and fairness implications.

Method: Probed residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) using explicit demographic disclosure prompts, then tested same probes on implicit cues (names, occupations) to analyze linear representations in activation space.

Result: LLMs develop linear representations where stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions; names activate census-aligned gender/race representations; occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics; these implicit representations actively shape downstream behavior like career recommendations.

Conclusion: Models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases through linear demographic representations, with significant fairness implications when deployed at scale, highlighting the need to address implicit bias in LLMs beyond standard benchmark evaluations.

Abstract: We investigate how LLMs encode sociodemographic attributes of human conversational partners inferred from indirect cues such as names and occupations. We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations. Our study further highlights that models that pass bias benchmark tests may still harbor and leverage implicit biases, with implications for fairness when applied at scale.

*Nick Jiang,Xiaoqing Sun,Lisa Dunlap,Lewis Smith,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAE embeddings from sparse autoencoders provide cost-effective, controllable, and interpretable representations for large-scale text analysis, outperforming LLM-based methods and dense embeddings across multiple data analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for analyzing large text corpora rely on expensive LLM-based techniques or dense embeddings that lack control over properties of interest, creating a need for more cost-effective and controllable approaches.

Method: Proposed using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings - representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts, enabling controlled analysis through concept filtering and manipulation.

Result: SAE embeddings uncover bigger dataset differences at 2-8x lower cost than LLMs, identify biases more reliably, outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval, and enable insights like semantic dataset differences and unexpected concept correlations.

Conclusion: SAEs are a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis that highlights the importance of interpreting models through their data, offering cost-effective, controllable, and interpretable representations for large-scale text analysis.

Abstract: Analyzing large-scale text corpora is a core challenge in machine learning, crucial for tasks like identifying undesirable model behaviors or biases in training data. Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding "trigger" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore Telegram groups, showing they're woven into everyday discussions rather than isolated echo chambers, using a signed belief graph neural network to identify seven narrative archetypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded in digital ecosystems but difficult to study; this work aims to understand its structure and spread in Singapore-based Telegram groups, challenging assumptions about online radicalization.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial (F1=0.866); 2) Build signed belief graph with message nodes and alignment edges, then develop Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) with Sign Disentanglement Loss to separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.

Result: Identified seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN achieved better clustering (cDBI=8.38) than baselines (13.60-67.27), with 88% expert agreement.

Conclusion: Conspiratorial messages appear within routine discussions, not just skepticism clusters, challenging assumptions about online radicalization. The framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis with applications for stance detection, political communication, and content moderation.

Abstract: Conspiratorial discourse is increasingly embedded within digital communication ecosystems, yet its structure and spread remain difficult to study. This work analyzes conspiratorial narratives in Singapore-based Telegram groups, showing that such content is woven into everyday discussions rather than confined to isolated echo chambers. We propose a two-stage computational framework. First, we fine-tune RoBERTa-large to classify messages as conspiratorial or not, achieving an F1-score of 0.866 on 2,000 expert-labeled messages. Second, we build a signed belief graph in which nodes represent messages and edge signs reflect alignment in belief labels, weighted by textual similarity. We introduce a Signed Belief Graph Neural Network (SiBeGNN) that uses a Sign Disentanglement Loss to learn embeddings that separate ideological alignment from stylistic features.
  Using hierarchical clustering on these embeddings, we identify seven narrative archetypes across 553,648 messages: legal topics, medical concerns, media discussions, finance, contradictions in authority, group moderation, and general chat. SiBeGNN yields stronger clustering quality (cDBI = 8.38) than baseline methods (13.60 to 67.27), supported by 88 percent inter-rater agreement in expert evaluations. Our analysis shows that conspiratorial messages appear not only in clusters focused on skepticism or distrust, but also within routine discussions of finance, law, and everyday matters. These findings challenge common assumptions about online radicalization by demonstrating that conspiratorial discourse operates within ordinary social interaction. The proposed framework advances computational methods for belief-driven discourse analysis and offers applications for stance detection, political communication studies, and content moderation policy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgriRegion is a RAG framework that reduces agricultural hallucinations in LLMs by incorporating geospatial metadata and region-prioritized re-ranking for locally accurate farming advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs suffer from contextual hallucinations in agriculture, providing advice that may be scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations.

Method: AgriRegion uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation with geospatial metadata injection and region-prioritized re-ranking, restricting knowledge to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval.

Result: AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLM systems and significantly improves trust scores on the novel AgriRegion-Eval benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: AgriRegion provides a specialized RAG framework for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory that addresses the critical problem of contextual hallucinations in farming advice.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in democratizing access to information. However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index shows transparency among major AI companies has declined from 58 to 40/100, with companies being most opaque about training data, compute, and post-deployment impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track how transparency practices of foundation model developers evolve as these companies become increasingly important, and to provide policymakers with insights into current transparency levels and needed interventions.

Method: Annual index evaluating foundation model developers using quantitative indicators, with 2025 edition introducing new metrics related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring, and expanding evaluation to include companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI.

Result: Transparency has deteriorated from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025; IBM scored highest at 95, while xAI and Midjourney scored lowest at 14; companies are most opaque about training data, training compute, and post-deployment usage/impact.

Conclusion: Despite increasing policy mandates for transparency, foundation model developers have become less transparent overall, suggesting need for more aggressive policy interventions to address critical information deficits, particularly around training data and post-deployment impact.

Abstract: Foundation model developers are among the world's most important companies. As these companies become increasingly consequential, how do their transparency practices evolve? The 2025 Foundation Model Transparency Index is the third edition of an annual effort to characterize and quantify the transparency of foundation model developers. The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.

Abstract: Medical care follows complex clinical pathways that extend beyond isolated physician-patient encounters, emphasizing decision-making and transitions between different stages. Current benchmarks focusing on static exams or isolated dialogues inadequately evaluate large language models (LLMs) in dynamic clinical scenarios. We introduce CP-Env, a controllable agentic hospital environment designed to evaluate LLMs across end-to-end clinical pathways. CP-Env simulates a hospital ecosystem with patient and physician agents, constructing scenarios ranging from triage and specialist consultation to diagnostic testing and multidisciplinary team meetings for agent interaction. Following real hospital adaptive flow of healthcare, it enables branching, long-horizon task execution.

### [139] [An exploration for higher efficiency in multi objective optimisation with reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10208)
*Mehmet Emin Aydin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using multi-objective reinforcement learning to optimize operator sequences in search algorithms, addressing efficiency challenges in optimization processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization algorithms face efficiency challenges, particularly in selecting optimal operator sequences for neighborhood moves. While single-objective optimization has seen work on this issue, multi-objective cases remain under-explored, creating a research gap.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach to generalize experiences and determine optimal/near-optimal sequences of operators for handling move operations in optimization algorithms.

Result: The paper presents an overview of a generalisation approach with certain stages completed and phases outstanding, suggesting work-in-progress status rather than final results.

Conclusion: Multi-objective reinforcement learning shows promise for improving optimization algorithm efficiency by learning optimal operator sequences, though the approach requires further development and validation.

Abstract: Efficiency in optimisation and search processes persists to be one of the challenges, which affects the performance and use of optimisation algorithms. Utilising a pool of operators instead of a single operator to handle move operations within a neighbourhood remains promising, but an optimum or near optimum sequence of operators necessitates further investigation. One of the promising ideas is to generalise experiences and seek how to utilise it. Although numerous works are done around this issue for single objective optimisation, multi-objective cases have not much been touched in this regard. A generalised approach based on multi-objective reinforcement learning approach seems to create remedy for this issue and offer good solutions. This paper overviews a generalisation approach proposed with certain stages completed and phases outstanding that is aimed to help demonstrate the efficiency of using multi-objective reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: ID-PaS extends Predict-and-Search framework to parametric MIPs with identity-aware learning for handling heterogeneous variables, outperforming Gurobi and PaS on real-world problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Predict-and-Search methods with ML are limited to binary problems and don't handle fixed variables common in practical settings, creating a need for more flexible approaches.

Method: Extends Predict-and-Search to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables ML models to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively.

Result: Experiments on real-world large-scale problems show ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and original PaS framework.

Conclusion: ID-PaS successfully extends the Predict-and-Search framework to handle parametric MIPs with heterogeneous variables, demonstrating practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MIPs) are powerful and flexible tools for modeling a wide range of real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a reverse thinking framework to help LLMs better identify missing information, addressing issues like incomplete responses and hallucinations that forward reasoning methods struggle with.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. Traditional forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information.

Method: The authors propose a novel reverse thinking framework that guides LLMs through backward reasoning to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. This transforms missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem.

Result: Experimental results show substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, with the reverse thinking approach significantly improving model accuracy on missing information detection tasks.

Conclusion: The reverse thinking approach provides a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness, offering an effective solution to the challenge of missing information in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning tasks, yet they often struggle with problems involving missing information, exhibiting issues such as incomplete responses, factual errors, and hallucinations. While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.

TL;DR: NAC is a novel continuous-time attention mechanism using biologically-inspired sparse gating networks that reformulates attention logits as ODE solutions, offering three computation modes and improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms improve representation learning but their discrete nature limits continuous-time modeling capabilities. The authors aim to create a biologically plausible continuous-time attention mechanism that can handle irregular temporal data more effectively.

Method: Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC) reformulates attention logits computation as a linear first-order ODE solution using nonlinear interlinked gates derived from C. elegans neuronal circuits. It replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates and uses a sparse backbone network with two heads for content-target and learnable time-constant gates. Supports three computation modes: explicit Euler integration, exact closed-form solution, and steady-state approximation. Includes sparse Top-K pairwise concatenation for memory efficiency.

Result: NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy across irregular time-series classification, autonomous vehicle lane-keeping, and industrial prognostics. It occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared to other continuous-time baselines.

Conclusion: NAC provides a biologically plausible, efficient continuous-time attention mechanism with theoretical guarantees (state stability, bounded errors, universal approximation) and practical performance advantages for temporal modeling tasks.

Abstract: Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.

TL;DR: Researchers propose an interpretability framework to analyze vision-language models, identifying specialized attention heads for different cognitive functions using a new dataset called CogVision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform well on benchmarks but remain largely a black box. The authors aim to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, particularly focusing on how attention heads contribute to multimodal reasoning.

Method: Introduced CogVision dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions simulating human chain-of-thought reasoning. Used probing-based methodology to identify attention heads specializing in specific receptive or cognitive functions (e.g., high-level visual reception, inference).

Result: Functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Intervention experiments show these heads are critical: removing them degrades performance while emphasizing them enhances accuracy.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Despite excelling on multimodal benchmarks, vision-language models (VLMs) largely remain a black box. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing gap between AI's technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Current ethical guidance is insufficient, requiring architectures that embed governance directly into AI execution frameworks to ensure trustworthy AI systems.

Method: Develops a comprehensive assurance framework called "Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI" that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. The framework provides governance for entire AI ecosystems including components, consumers, and human participants.

Result: The framework demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically engineered into AI systems, ensuring execution remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control. It draws inspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the accountability gap in AI systems by embedding governance into the execution fabric, moving beyond mere ethical guidance to provide practical, engineered solutions for trustworthy AI orchestration.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.

TL;DR: InfoCom is a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that reduces data transmission from MB to KB scale while maintaining near-lossless perception performance through information purification principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving systems require precise environmental perception, but collaborative perception faces a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing approaches assume MB-level data transmission which may fail under practical network constraints.

Method: InfoCom introduces an information purification paradigm based on extended Information Bottleneck principles, featuring: 1) Information-Aware Encoding to condense features into minimal messages, 2) Sparse Mask Generation to identify spatial cues with negligible cost, and 3) Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms.

Result: InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP respectively.

Conclusion: InfoCom establishes a pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception, addressing practical network constraints while maintaining perception performance through information purification rather than feature manipulation.

Abstract: Precise environmental perception is critical for the reliability of autonomous driving systems. While collaborative perception mitigates the limitations of single-agent perception through information sharing, it encounters a fundamental communication-performance trade-off. Existing communication-efficient approaches typically assume MB-level data transmission per collaboration, which may fail due to practical network constraints. To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that InfoCom achieves near-lossless perception while reducing communication overhead from megabyte to kilobyte-scale, representing 440-fold and 90-fold reductions per agent compared to Where2comm and ERMVP, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude valuable user feedback, relying only on unsupervised adaptation from environmental exposure. User feedback offers natural supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality for real-world deployment.

Method: Introduces a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that systematically integrates human interactions into continual learning. Converts user feedback (navigation instructions and corrective signals) into high-quality, environment-aligned training data. Uses a memory-bank warm-start mechanism to reuse previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation.

Result: Experiments on GSA-R2R benchmark show consistent improvement over strong baselines like GR-DUET, enhancing navigation success and path efficiency. Memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Robust performance across both continual and hybrid adaptation settings.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that integrating user feedback into continual adaptation significantly improves VLN performance, with memory-bank warm-start ensuring stable redeployment and sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to navigate complex environments by following natural-language instructions. General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACE (Adaptive path Correction with Exponents), a method that prevents Marginal Path Collapse in ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion/flow models, enabling reliable compositional generation with heterogeneous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ratio-of-densities steering for diffusion/flow models suffers from Marginal Path Collapse when combining heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, which is problematic for applications like molecular design where multiple specialized models need to be combined.

Method: 1) Derives a path existence criterion to predict collapse from noise schedules and exponents alone. 2) Introduces ACE (Adaptive path Correction with Exponents) that extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents, guaranteeing valid probability paths.

Result: ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models on both synthetic 2D benchmarks and flexible-pose scaffold decoration tasks.

Conclusion: ACE transforms ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation, particularly valuable for complex applications like molecular design.

Abstract: Inference-time steering enables pretrained diffusion/flow models to be adapted to new tasks without retraining. A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models. Our work turns ratio-of-densities steering with heterogeneous experts from an unstable heuristic into a reliable tool for controllable generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMISVFU is a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework for fast client-level unlearning in split Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) systems, addressing the right to be forgotten in feature-partitioned architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data protection regulations like GDPR require federated systems to support the right to be forgotten. While federated unlearning exists for Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) with feature-partitioned data presents unique challenges that make HFL unlearning methods ineffective.

Method: REMISVFU uses representation misdirection where the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, breaking the statistical link between its features and the global model. The server jointly optimizes retention and forgetting losses with orthogonal projection to align gradients and eliminate destructive interference.

Result: Evaluations show REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to natural class-prior levels while sacrificing only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enables fast client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems while maintaining utility for remaining parties, addressing the unique challenges of feature-partitioned architectures in vertical federated learning.

Abstract: Data-protection regulations such as the GDPR grant every participant in a federated system a right to be forgotten. Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

*Ziying Zhang,Quanming Yao,Yaqing Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EmerFlow is an LLM-powered framework for recommending emerging items by generating distinctive embeddings through LLM reasoning, embedding space alignment, and meta-learning refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommendation methods overlook the dynamic process of emerging items whose interactions gradually accumulate over time, often assuming they have few or no historical interactions. This oversimplifies the problem as models need to preserve emerging items' uniqueness while leveraging shared patterns with established items.

Method: EmerFlow uses LLM reasoning to enrich raw features of emerging items, aligns these representations with existing recommendation model's embedding space, and incorporates new interactions through meta-learning to refine embeddings, enabling learning from limited interactions.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse domains (movies and pharmaceuticals) show EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods in recommending emerging items.

Conclusion: EmerFlow effectively addresses the challenge of recommending emerging items by generating distinctive embeddings through LLM empowerment, embedding alignment, and meta-learning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the challenge of recommending emerging items, whose interactions gradually accumulate over time. Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: AgentProg is a program-guided approach for mobile GUI agent context management that organizes interaction history as a program with variables and control flow to reduce context overhead while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile GUI agents for long-horizon task automation face critical bottlenecks due to reliance on ever-expanding interaction history, which incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance.

Method: AgentProg reframes interaction history as a program with variables and control flow, organizing information according to program structure to determine what information should be retained or discarded. It also integrates a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes.

Result: Experiments on AndroidWorld and extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg achieves state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. It maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Conclusion: AgentProg provides an effective program-guided approach for agent context management that reduces context overhead while preserving semantic information, enabling robust performance in long-horizon mobile GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban regeneration faces significant challenges in the urbanization context, requiring adaptive approaches to address evolving needs. Traditional planning methods may lack the dynamism and responsiveness needed for complex urban environments.

Method: Proposes Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP) with three key LLM-based components: (1) Planning agents generate/refine urban plans using contextual data; (2) Living agents simulate resident behaviors and interactions; (3) Judging agents evaluate plan effectiveness and provide iterative feedback for improvement in a closed-loop system.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness as a continuous and adaptive planning process, showing it can dynamically respond to urban planning needs.

Conclusion: CUP represents a new paradigm for urban planning that leverages LLMs to create a cyclical, adaptive approach that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans, offering a more dynamic solution to urban regeneration challenges.

Abstract: Urban regeneration presents significant challenges within the context of urbanization, requiring adaptive approaches to tackle evolving needs. Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework as a continuous and adaptive planning process.

TL;DR: SaEI (Selective-adversarial Entropy Intervention) enhances VLM reasoning by using entropy-guided adversarial sampling to distort visual inputs, increasing response diversity during RL sampling without harming factual knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL-based finetuning methods for VLMs only intervene in entropy during policy optimization, ignoring entropy intervention during RL sampling which could improve response diversity and boost performance of GRPO.

Method: Proposes SaEI with two components: 1) Entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formulates entropy of sampled responses as adversarial objective to attack visual inputs, and 2) Token-selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize adversarial attack effectiveness without distorting factual knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show the method greatly improves policy exploration via entropy intervention, boosting reasoning capabilities of VLMs.

Conclusion: SaEI effectively enhances policy entropy through selective-adversarial intervention during RL sampling, improving VLM reasoning by increasing response diversity while preserving factual knowledge.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has become a common choice in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities. Code will be released once the paper is accepted.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel method to represent graphs as strings of instructions that build adjacency matrices, making graphs amenable to processing by deep learning language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph representations are not suitable for deep learning language models, which are powerful for text processing but not designed for graph data structures.

Method: Proposes representing graphs by converting adjacency matrices into strings of simple instructions that build the matrix step by step, with the transformation being reversible.

Result: The representation is compact, maintains local structural patterns of graphs, and preliminary computational experiments show favorable results.

Conclusion: This new graph representation method could enhance graph processing by deep learning models by making graphs compatible with text-based language model architectures.

Abstract: The representation of graphs is commonly based on the adjacency matrix concept. This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph. Therefore, it is envisaged that it could be useful to boost the processing of graphs by deep learning models. A tentative computational experiment is reported, with favorable results.

*Hojun Lee,Mijin Koo,Yeji Song,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFAP is the first method to achieve effective Targeted Data Protection in diffusion models by controlling the entire training trajectory rather than just snapshots, enabling robust redirection to target concepts while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protection methods for text-to-image models only degrade image quality passively and lack stable control. While Targeted Data Protection offers active redirection, existing approaches suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching that ignores complete learning dynamics.

Method: TAFAP uses trajectory alignment via fine-tuning with adversarial perturbations, employing trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent transformations throughout the entire training process rather than just at snapshots.

Result: TAFAP achieves the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns, significantly outperforming existing TDP attempts while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: TAFAP enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs, addressing privacy concerns in personalization while maintaining effective protection throughout training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have made fine-tuning text-to-image models for personalization increasingly accessible, but have also raised significant concerns regarding unauthorized data usage and privacy infringement. Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how adversarial PDF manipulation can exploit LLM-based peer review systems to flip "Reject" decisions to "Accept," introducing a novel WAVS metric and demonstrating successful attacks across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the rapid integration of LLMs in scientific peer review through both individual reviewer use (Lazy Reviewer hypothesis) and formal institutional deployment, creating vulnerabilities that could be exploited by authors seeking acceptance for rejected papers.

Method: The authors curated 200 scientific papers, adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies for PDF manipulation, and evaluated them across 13 language models including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. They developed the WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score) metric to measure system vulnerability.

Result: Results show that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models, demonstrating significant vulnerabilities in LLM-based peer review systems.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical security flaws in LLM-powered peer review systems and calls for more research on adversarial robustness, with the authors committing to release their complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate further investigation.

Abstract: The landscape of scientific peer review is rapidly evolving with the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift is driven by two parallel trends: the widespread individual adoption of LLMs by reviewers to manage workload (the "Lazy Reviewer" hypothesis) and the formal institutional deployment of AI-powered assessment systems by conferences like AAAI and Stanford's Agents4Science. This study investigates the robustness of these "LLM-as-a-Judge" systems (both illicit and sanctioned) to adversarial PDF manipulation. Unlike general jailbreaks, we focus on a distinct incentive: flipping "Reject" decisions to "Accept," for which we develop a novel evaluation metric which we term as WAVS (Weighted Adversarial Vulnerability Score). We curated a dataset of 200 scientific papers and adapted 15 domain-specific attack strategies to this task, evaluating them across 13 Language Models, including GPT-5, Claude Haiku, and DeepSeek. Our results demonstrate that obfuscation strategies like "Maximum Mark Magyk" successfully manipulate scores, achieving alarming decision flip rates even in large-scale models. We will release our complete dataset and injection framework to facilitate more research on this topic.

TL;DR: Training-free LLM agent architecture for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration using Actor-Critic agents to bridge semantic gap between natural language instructions and technical parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCG requires precise configuration of opaque technical parameters, but off-the-shelf LLMs fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications.

Method: Proposes a training-free architecture with Actor and Critic LLM agents that work iteratively: Actor reasons over tool parameters, Critic refines configurations to align with human design preferences.

Result: Outperforms single-agent baselines, produces diverse and structurally valid 3D maps from natural language descriptions, establishes new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools without task-specific fine-tuning, shifting burden from model training to architectural reasoning.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) offers scalable methods for algorithmically creating complex, customizable worlds. However, controlling these pipelines requires the precise configuration of opaque technical parameters. We propose a training-free architecture that utilizes LLM agents for zero-shot PCG parameter configuration. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise a natural language interface for PCG tools, off-the-shelf models often fail to bridge the semantic gap between abstract user instructions and strict parameter specifications. Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions. These results demonstrate that off-the-shelf LLMs can be effectively repurposed as generalized agents for arbitrary PCG tools. By shifting the burden from model training to architectural reasoning, our method offers a scalable framework for mastering complex software without task-specific fine-tuning.

TL;DR: InternGeometry is an LLM agent that achieves medalist-level performance on IMO geometry problems using iterative proposition generation, symbolic verification, and dynamic memory, requiring only 0.004% of AlphaGeometry 2's training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI geometry problem solving is dominated by expert models like AlphaGeometry 2 that require massive data synthesis and search, while LLMs have shown strong mathematical abilities but lack good heuristics for auxiliary constructions in geometry.

Method: Iterative proposition and auxiliary construction generation with symbolic engine verification, dynamic memory for 200+ interactions per problem, and Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) that gradually increases problem complexity during training.

Result: Solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding average gold medalist score of 40.9, using only 13K training examples (0.004% of AlphaGeometry 2's data), and can propose novel auxiliary constructions not in human solutions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates LLM agents' potential for expert-level geometry tasks with efficient data usage, introduces novel training methodology, and will release model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.

*Zouying Cao,Jiaji Deng,Li Yu,Weikang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Hai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReMe is a framework that transforms LLM agent memory from passive storage to dynamic reasoning through multi-faceted distillation, context-adaptive reuse, and utility-based refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant memory-scaling effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent memory frameworks suffer from "passive accumulation" where memory is treated as a static archive, creating a gap between storage and dynamic reasoning needed for effective experience-driven evolution.

Method: ReMe introduces three mechanisms: 1) multi-faceted distillation extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers, and generating comparative insights; 2) context-adaptive reuse tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; 3) utility-based refinement autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool.

Result: Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld show ReMe establishes new state-of-the-art in agent memory systems. Qwen3-8B with ReMe outperforms larger memoryless Qwen3-14B, demonstrating significant memory-scaling effects and computation-efficient lifelong learning.

Conclusion: ReMe bridges the gap between static memory storage and dynamic reasoning, enabling self-evolving memory that provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning in LLM agents, with released code and dataset to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Procedural memory enables large language model (LLM) agents to internalize "how-to" knowledge, theoretically reducing redundant trial-and-error. However, existing frameworks predominantly suffer from a "passive accumulation" paradigm, treating memory as a static append-only archive. To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning. We release our code and the $\texttt{reme.library}$ dataset to facilitate further research.

*Xin Guan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NormCode is a semiformal language for constructing isolated-step AI workflows that prevents context pollution in LLM chains by enforcing strict separation between semantic (LLM) and syntactic (deterministic) operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multistep LLM workflows suffer from context pollution where accumulating information across steps causes hallucinations, confusion of intermediate outputs, and loss of task constraints, creating reliability issues in high-stakes domains.

Method: NormCode uses a semiformal language with three isomorphic formats (.ncds for authoring, .ncd for execution, .ncn for verification) that enforces strict separation between semantic LLM operations and deterministic syntactic operations, with each step operating in data isolation.

Result: Validated through two demonstrations: (1) base X addition algorithm achieving 100% accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self-hosted execution of NormCode's own five-phase compiler pipeline, with working orchestrator providing dependency scheduling, checkpointing, and loop management.

Conclusion: NormCode addresses critical transparency needs in high-stakes domains by making AI workflows auditable by design through elimination of cross-step contamination and enabling precise cost and reliability tracing.

Abstract: Multistep workflows that chain large language model (LLM) calls suffer from context pollution: as information accumulates across steps, models hallucinate, confuse intermediate outputs, and lose track of task constraints. We present NormCode, a semiformal language for constructing plans of inferences, structured decompositions where each step operates in data isolation and receives only explicitly passed inputs, which eliminates crossstep contamination by design. NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing. The language exists in three isomorphic formats: .ncds for human authoring, .ncd for machine execution, and .ncn for human verification, supporting progressive formalization from sketch to production. We validate NormCode through two demonstrations: (1) a base X addition algorithm achieving 100 percent accuracy on arbitrary length inputs, and (2) self hosted execution of NormCode's own five phase compiler pipeline. The working orchestrator provides dependency driven scheduling, SQLite backed checkpointing, and loop management, making AI workflows auditable by design and addressing a critical need for transparency in high stakes domains such as legal reasoning, medical decision making, and financial analysis.

### [161] [Replace, Don't Expand: Mitigating Context Dilution in Multi-Hop RAG via Fixed-Budget Evidence Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10787)
*Moshe Lahmy,Roi Yozevitch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAL-RAG introduces a "replace, don't expand" strategy for multi-hop RAG queries, using entity-anchored extraction and targeted micro-queries to swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence within fixed retrieval depth, significantly improving answer correctness and evidence precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems struggle with multi-hop queries when initial retrieval misses bridge facts. Existing corrective approaches (Self-RAG, CRAG, Adaptive-k) add more context or prune lists, but this leads to context dilution where distractors crowd out relevant information.

Method: SEAL-RAG uses a training-free controller with a "replace, don't expand" strategy under fixed retrieval depth k. It executes a Search → Extract → Assess → Loop cycle: performs entity-anchored extraction to build gap specifications (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses entity-first ranking to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence.

Result: On HotpotQA (k=3), SEAL improves answer correctness by +3-13 pp and evidence precision by +12-18 pp over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA (k=5), it outperforms Adaptive-k by +8.0 pp in accuracy and maintains 96% evidence precision compared to 22% for CRAG. Gains are statistically significant (p<0.001).

Conclusion: SEAL-RAG's fixed-k replacement strategy yields predictable cost profile while ensuring top-k slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth, effectively combating context dilution in multi-hop RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often fail on multi-hop queries when the initial retrieval misses a bridge fact. Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\textbf{S}earch $\rightarrow$ \textbf{E}xtract $\rightarrow$ \textbf{A}ssess $\rightarrow$ \textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \textbf{HotpotQA} and \textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG. On 2WikiMultiHopQA ($k=5$), it outperforms Adaptive-$k$ by \textbf{+8.0 pp} in accuracy and maintains \textbf{96\%} evidence precision compared to 22\% for CRAG. These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth. We release our code and data at https://github.com/mosherino/SEAL-RAG.

*Minghao LI,Ruihang Wang,Rui Tan,Yonggang Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Phythesis is a framework combining LLMs and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready data center design, achieving 57.3% higher generation success and 11.5% PUE improvement over vanilla LLM solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data center design methods using human expertise and simulation tools don't scale with increasing complexity. Existing AI approaches don't consider physics, making them unsuitable for DC design which requires quantifiable objectives and strict physical constraints.

Method: Phythesis uses iterative bi-level optimization: (1) LLM-driven optimization generates physically plausible 3D layouts and self-criticizes to refine scene topology, (2) physics-informed optimization identifies optimal asset parameters and selects best asset combinations.

Result: Experiments on three generation scales show Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement compared to vanilla LLM-based solutions.

Conclusion: Phythesis successfully bridges the gap between generative AI and physics-based design by synergizing LLMs with evolutionary optimization, enabling automated simulation-ready scene synthesis for energy-efficient data center design.

Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.

*Liang Peng,Haopeng Liu,Yixuan Ye,Cheng Liu,Wenjun Shen,Si Wu,Hau-San Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: scRCL is a refinement contrastive learning framework for unsupervised cell type identification that incorporates cell-gene interactions to improve representation learning and clustering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering methods for single-cell omics focus only on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore cell-gene associations, limiting their ability to distinguish closely related cell types.

Method: Proposes scRCL with two contrastive distribution alignment components to reveal cellular structures, plus a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to capture cell-gene associations and enhance cell embeddings.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets in cell-type identification accuracy, with recovered populations showing coherent gene-expression signatures.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating cell-gene interactions through contrastive learning and refinement modules improves unsupervised cell type identification and yields biologically meaningful representations.

Abstract: Unsupervised cell type identification is crucial for uncovering and characterizing heterogeneous populations in single cell omics studies. Although a range of clustering methods have been developed, most focus exclusively on intrinsic cellular structure and ignore the pivotal role of cell-gene associations, which limits their ability to distinguish closely related cell types. To this end, we propose a Refinement Contrastive Learning framework (scRCL) that explicitly incorporates cell-gene interactions to derive more informative representations. Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy. Moreover, downstream biological analyses confirm that the recovered cell populations exhibit coherent gene-expression signatures, further validating the biological relevance of our approach.

*Tong Zhang,Carlos Hinojosa,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAPTAIN is a training-free framework that reduces memorization in diffusion models by modifying latent features during denoising, using frequency-based noise initialization, optimal timestep identification, and feature injection from reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are deployed at scale. Existing mitigation methods struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with conditioning prompts.

Method: CAPTAIN uses frequency-based noise initialization to reduce memorization tendency early in denoising, identifies optimal timesteps for feature injection, localizes memorized regions, and injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions.

Result: CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt and preserving visual quality.

Conclusion: CAPTAIN provides an effective training-free framework for mitigating memorization in diffusion models without compromising prompt fidelity, addressing privacy and copyright concerns in large-scale deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models can unintentionally reproduce training examples, raising privacy and copyright concerns as these systems are increasingly deployed at scale. Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.

*Muhua Huang,Qinlin Zhao,Xiaoyuan Yi,Xing Xie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Value diversity in AI agent communities enhances stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and increases creative self-governance, but with diminishing returns at extreme heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diversity of values shapes collective behavior in LLM-based multi-agent systems, bridging AI capabilities with sociological studies of institutional emergence.

Method: Used naturalistic value elicitation based on Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values to construct multi-agent simulations where communities with varying agent numbers engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation.

Result: Value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by agents themselves without external guidance, but with diminishing returns as extreme heterogeneity induces instability.

Conclusion: Value diversity represents a new axis of future AI capability that bridges AI ability with sociological studies of institutional emergence, with optimal benefits at moderate diversity levels.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLM) based multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the collective behaviors, e.g., collective intelligence, of such artificial communities have drawn growing attention. This work aims to answer a fundamental question: How does diversity of values shape the collective behavior of AI communities? Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance. However, these effects also show diminishing returns: extreme heterogeneity induces instability. This work positions value diversity as a new axis of future AI capability, bridging AI ability and sociological studies of institutional emergence.

### [166] [AEBNAS: Strengthening Exit Branches in Early-Exit Networks through Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10671)
*Oscar Robben,Saeed Khalilian,Nirvana Meratnia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hardware-aware NAS framework designs optimized early-exit networks with strengthened exit branches, achieving higher accuracy with same/lower computational cost than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early-exit networks reduce energy/latency but designing them is challenging; existing NAS approaches don't fully optimize exit branch depth/layer types, limiting efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs.

Method: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search that optimizes exit branch positions, depths, and layer types simultaneously with adaptive threshold tuning for dynamic inference.

Result: On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets, the framework designs networks achieving higher accuracy with same/lower average MACs than state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware NAS with exit branch strengthening and adaptive thresholds effectively designs efficient early-exit networks, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Early-exit networks are effective solutions for reducing the overall energy consumption and latency of deep learning models by adjusting computation based on the complexity of input data. By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

### [167] [Challenges of Evaluating LLM Safety for User Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10687)
*Manon Kempermann,Sai Suresh Macharla Vasu,Mahalakshmi Raveenthiran,Theo Farrell,Ingmar Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks but neglect context-dependent user welfare, showing that realistic user prompts alone don't improve safety assessments for vulnerable populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety evaluations focus on universal risks (dangerous capabilities) but ignore context-dependent harms for individual users seeking personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, creating a gap in user-welfare safety assessment.

Method: Conducted exploratory studies evaluating finance/health advice from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles with varying vulnerability. First compared context-blind vs. context-aware evaluator safety ratings, then tested whether realistic user prompts containing disclosed context improved assessments.

Result: Context-blind evaluators rated identical LLM responses significantly safer than context-aware evaluators (safety scores dropped from 5/7 to 3/7 for high-vulnerability users). Realistic user prompts containing context users would disclose showed no significant improvement in safety evaluations.

Conclusion: Effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone is insufficient, especially for vulnerable populations. The study provides methodology for context-aware evaluation distinct from universal-risk frameworks.

Abstract: Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL optimization improves CXR VLM performance for report generation and visual grounding, but explicit thinking doesn't provide additional benefits beyond strong SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical VLMs rely mainly on supervised fine-tuning without evaluating answer quality, while RL with thinking has shown success in other domains like math and coding tasks.

Method: Built RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL with large-scale SFT on CXR data, added cold-start SFT for basic thinking ability, then applied Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded rewards for report generation and visual grounding tasks.

Result: RL provides additional gains on both report generation and grounding tasks, while explicit thinking does not further improve results. RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform baselines and reach state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Clinically aligned RL is a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs, though strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved Chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation in multiple aspects. However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning ("thinking") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.

TL;DR: CA-GPT, a domain-specific AI model for OCT-guided PCI, outperformed both general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians in procedural decision-making for both pre-PCI planning and post-PCI assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While intravascular imaging like OCT improves PCI outcomes, interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose AI lacks domain-specific reliability, creating a need for specialized AI systems for OCT-guided PCI.

Method: Single-center analysis of 96 patients undergoing OCT-guided PCI, comparing procedural decisions from CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians against expert-derived procedural records using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.

Result: CA-GPT showed significantly higher median agreement scores than both ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for pre-PCI planning (5 vs 3 vs 4) and post-PCI assessment (5 vs 4 vs 5). CA-GPT outperformed in stent diameter (90.3% vs 72.2%) and length selection (80.6% vs 52.8%) compared to junior physicians.

Conclusion: CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system provides superior decision-making agreement compared to general-purpose AI and junior physicians, offering a standardized, reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation that can augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

Abstract: Background: While intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its interpretation is operator-dependent. General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.
  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.
  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.
  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases. This approach provides a standardized and reliable method for intravascular imaging interpretation, demonstrating significant potential to augment operator expertise and optimize OCT-guided PCI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAROOD is a comprehensive benchmark for human activity recognition in out-of-distribution settings, evaluating 16 methods across 4 OOD scenarios using 6 datasets to assess OOD algorithm effectiveness for HAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HAR research lacks comprehensive evaluation of OOD algorithms across different distribution shift scenarios (cross-person, device, environment, time). There's uncertainty about whether OOD is necessary for HAR and which algorithms perform best.

Method: Proposed HAROOD benchmark with 4 OOD scenarios (cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, cross-time), covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures, and two model selection protocols.

Result: Extensive experiments show no single method consistently outperforms others across all scenarios, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement in OOD-based HAR research.

Conclusion: HAROOD provides a modular, extensible benchmark to facilitate research in OOD-based HAR, with findings indicating significant room for improvement in current OOD algorithms for activity recognition.

Abstract: Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agile Deliberation: A human-in-the-loop framework for evolving visual concept classification that supports users in refining vague concepts through borderline case exposure and iterative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing content moderation systems assume users have clear, stable concept understanding, but in reality users often start with vague ideas that need iterative refinement through "concept deliberation" - a practice discovered through interviews with content moderation experts.

Method: Two-stage deliberation framework: (1) concept scoping decomposes initial concept into structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, (2) concept iteration surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align image classifier with user's evolving intent.

Result: Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, with participants reporting clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort (based on 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long).

Conclusion: The framework effectively supports evolving and subjective concepts in content moderation/curation by operationalizing real content moderators' deliberation strategies, moving beyond assumptions of stable concept understanding to better match real-world user needs.

Abstract: From content moderation to content curation, applications requiring vision classifiers for visual concepts are rapidly expanding. Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through "concept deliberation", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called "Agile Deliberation" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V-OCBF learns neural Control Barrier Functions from offline data without dynamics models, using finite-difference updates and expectile objectives to guarantee safety without online interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Safe Offline RL methods only enforce soft expected-cost constraints without forward invariance guarantees, while CBFs require expert-designed barriers or full system dynamics knowledge. There's a need for model-free offline safety guarantees.

Method: V-OCBF learns neural CBFs from offline demonstrations using recursive finite-difference barrier updates (no dynamics model needed), incorporates expectile-based objectives to avoid OOD actions, restricts updates to dataset-supported actions, and uses QP formulation for real-time safe control synthesis.

Result: V-OCBF achieves substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods across multiple case studies while maintaining strong task performance, demonstrating scalability for offline safety-critical controller synthesis.

Conclusion: V-OCBF provides a framework for learning safety guarantees from offline data without dynamics models or hand-engineered barriers, enabling real-time safe control without online interaction.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous systems requires controllers that satisfy hard, state-wise constraints without relying on online interaction. While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.

TL;DR: NeHaD introduces a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting using Hamiltonian mechanics to achieve physically plausible dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic view synthesis methods produce high-quality rendering but often result in physically implausible motions. MLP-based deformation fields introduce biases leading to unnatural dynamics, creating a need for physics-informed approaches.

Method: Uses Hamiltonian neural networks to learn physical laws governing deformation, incorporates Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition to separate static/dynamic Gaussians based on energy states, employs second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization for dissipation handling, and extends to adaptive streaming via scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization.

Result: Achieves physically plausible dynamic scene rendering with quality-efficiency trade-off, demonstrating robust and realistic results through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: First exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.

Abstract: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes with complex motions remains challenging in computer vision and graphics. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior Gaussian Splatting methods treat points independently, leading to topological inconsistencies and limited editing flexibility. There's a need for a structured approach that maintains photorealistic rendering quality while enabling robust mesh reconstruction and editing.

Method: Anchors 2D Gaussian splats to a deformable template mesh, uses gradient diffusion strategy to propagate supervision across surfaces, and employs alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality, enables extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, and supports downstream applications like editing and cross-object manipulation.

Conclusion: DeMapGS successfully bridges Gaussian Splatting with deformable surfaces, overcoming topological limitations while preserving rendering quality and enabling practical editing applications.

Abstract: We propose DeMapGS, a structured Gaussian Splatting framework that jointly optimizes deformable surfaces and surface-attached 2D Gaussian splats. By anchoring splats to a deformable template mesh, our method overcomes topological inconsistencies and enhances editing flexibility, addressing limitations of prior Gaussian Splatting methods that treat points independently. The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions. Experiments demonstrate that DeMapGS achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality and enables downstream applications for Gaussian splats such as editing and cross-object manipulation through a shared parametric surface.
