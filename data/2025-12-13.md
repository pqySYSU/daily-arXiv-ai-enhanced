*Yiwen Tang,Zoey Guo,Kaixin Zhu,Ray Zhang,Qizhi Chen,Dongzhi Jiang,Junli Liu,Bohan Zeng,Haoming Song,Delin Qu,Tianyi Bai,Dan Xu,Wentao Zhang,Bin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation, introducing AR3D-R1 as the first RL-enhanced 3D model with hierarchical optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has been effective for 2D image generation but remains unexplored for 3D due to higher spatial complexity requiring globally consistent geometry and fine-grained textures, making 3D generation sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms.

Method: Systematic study across four dimensions: (1) Reward designs evaluating dimensions and model choices, (2) RL algorithms studying GRPO variants and token-level optimization, (3) Introducing MME-3DR benchmark for implicit reasoning, (4) Proposing Hi-GRPO for hierarchical global-to-local optimization with reward ensembles.

Result: Developed AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model that excels from coarse shape to texture refinement, with code released publicly.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation and demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical optimization approaches for complex 3D spatial tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation. Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1.

### [2] [MMSI-Video-Bench: A Holistic Benchmark for Video-Based Spatial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10863)
*Jingli Lin,Runsen Xu,Shaohao Zhu,Sihan Yang,Peizhou Cao,Yunlong Ran,Miao Hu,Chenming Zhu,Yiman Xie,Yilin Long,Wenbo Hu,Dahua Lin,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSI-Video-Bench is a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark for evaluating video-based spatial intelligence in multimodal large language models, covering four levels of spatial reasoning across 1,106 questions from diverse video sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack comprehensive assessment for spatial understanding in continuous visual input, which is crucial for them to become effective assistants in physical environments. There's no holistic benchmark to measure progress toward this goal.

Method: The benchmark operationalizes a four-level framework (Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning) through 1,106 carefully designed questions grounded in 1,278 video clips from 25 existing datasets and in-house videos. Each item was reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales.

Result: Evaluation of 25 strong MLLMs reveals a significant human-AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. Spatially fine-tuned models fail to generalize effectively. Systematic failures are found in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence.

Conclusion: The benchmark establishes a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence, revealing current limitations in MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and providing insights for future model development.

Abstract: Spatial understanding over continuous visual input is crucial for MLLMs to evolve into general-purpose assistants in physical environments. Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains. We expect our benchmark to establish a solid testbed for advancing video-based spatial intelligence.

*Shengao Wang,Wenqi Wang,Zecheng Wang,Max Whitton,Michael Wakeham,Arjun Chandra,Joey Huang,Pengyue Zhu,Helen Chen,David Li,Jeffrey Li,Shawn Li,Andrew Zagula,Amy Zhao,Andrew Zhu,Sayaka Nakamura,Yuki Yamamoto,Jerry Jun Yokono,Aaron Mueller,Bryan A. Plummer,Kate Saenko,Venkatesh Saligrama,Boqing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BabyVLM-V2 is a developmentally grounded vision-language model framework inspired by infant learning, featuring improved pretraining data, a versatile model, and a cognitive evaluation toolbox (DevCV) with 10 multimodal tasks aligned with early childhood capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early children's developmental trajectories provide a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models, aiming to create more developmentally plausible AI systems that learn like infants.

Method: 1) Longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set covering infant-centric audiovisual corpus (video-utterance, image-utterance, multi-turn conversations); 2) Versatile model architecture; 3) DevCV Toolbox adapting NIH Baby Toolbox measures into 10 multimodal tasks for cognitive evaluation.

Result: A compact model pretrained from scratch achieves competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks, demonstrating sample-efficient learning aligned with early childhood capabilities.

Conclusion: The principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework accelerates research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models by providing better training data, evaluation benchmarks, and showing that infant-inspired learning can be sample-efficient.

Abstract: Early children's developmental trajectories set up a natural goal for sample-efficient pretraining of vision foundation models. We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks. We hope the principled, unified BabyVLM-V2 framework will accelerate research in developmentally plausible pretraining of vision foundation models.

### [4] [Any4D: Unified Feed-Forward Metric 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10935)
*Jay Karhade,Nikhil Keetha,Yuchen Zhang,Tanisha Gupta,Akash Sharma,Sebastian Scherer,Deva Ramanan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Any4D is a scalable multi-view transformer for dense 4D reconstruction that directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for multiple frames, supporting various input modalities and achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking, lacking comprehensive 4D reconstruction capabilities. There's a need for a flexible framework that can handle multiple modalities and sensors for complete 4D scene understanding.

Method: Any4D uses a modular representation of 4D scenes with egocentric factors (depthmaps, camera intrinsics) in local camera coordinates and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics, scene flow) in global world coordinates. It's a scalable multi-view transformer that processes RGB videos and can incorporate additional modalities like RGB-D, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements.

Result: Achieves 2-3X lower error compared to prior methods and 15X faster computation, demonstrating superior performance across diverse setups for 4D reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: Any4D provides a flexible, efficient framework for dense 4D reconstruction that supports multiple modalities, opening avenues for various downstream applications in scene understanding and motion analysis.

Abstract: We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates. We achieve superior performance across diverse setups - both in terms of accuracy (2-3X lower error) and compute efficiency (15X faster), opening avenues for multiple downstream applications.

### [5] [OmniView: An All-Seeing Diffusion Model for 3D and 4D View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10940)
*Xiang Fan,Sharath Girish,Vivek Ramanujan,Chaoyang Wang,Ashkan Mirzaei,Petr Sushko,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Sergey Tulyakov,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniView is a unified diffusion framework that generalizes across 4D consistency tasks by separately representing space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations for novel view synthesis, video generation, and camera control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches to camera control in diffusion models are fragmented, focusing on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks and trained on disjoint data slices. This fragmentation limits generalization and requires multiple specialized models.

Method: OmniView introduces a unified framework that separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. The method can handle static, dynamic, and multiview inputs for novel view synthesis, temporal extrapolation, and video generation with camera control.

Result: OmniView achieves competitive performance with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks: improves image quality scores by up to 33% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reduces camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: OmniView demonstrates strong generalizability in a single model, showing the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model that can handle multiple 4D consistency tasks without task-specific specialization.

Abstract: Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation. With strong generalizability in one model, OmniView demonstrates the feasibility of a generalist 4D video model. Project page is available at https://snap-research.github.io/OmniView/

### [6] [Mull-Tokens: Modality-Agnostic Latent Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10941)
*Arijit Ray,Ahmed Abdelkader,Chengzhi Mao,Bryan A. Plummer,Kate Saenko,Ranjay Krishna,Leonidas Guibas,Wen-Sheng Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mull-Tokens introduces modality-agnostic latent tokens that can hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities, enabling free-form multimodal reasoning without relying on specialist tools, image generation, or handcrafted data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models are brittle and don't scale well, relying on expensive tools, image generation, or handcrafted data for modality switching. Real-world reasoning requires thinking about space, time, affordances, and other concepts that words alone cannot convey.

Method: Mull-Tokens are modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities. They are first trained using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, then fine-tuned without supervision using only final answers, inspired by latent reasoning frameworks.

Result: Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks (including puzzle solving and perspective-taking tasks), Mull-Tokens achieved +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to the strongest baseline, outperforming text-only reasoning and interleaved image-text reasoning approaches.

Conclusion: Mull-Tokens offer a simple solution for abstract multimodal reasoning, enabling models to think freely across modalities without the complexity of existing approaches, contributing to better grounding of textual and visual reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.

### [7] [AlcheMinT: Fine-grained Temporal Control for Multi-Reference Consistent Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10943)
*Sharath Girish,Viacheslav Ivanov,Tsai-Shien Chen,Hao Chen,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Sergey Tulyakov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlcheMinT introduces timestamp conditioning for subject-driven video generation, enabling precise temporal control over subject appearance/disappearance in multi-subject videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subject-driven video generation methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which is essential for applications like compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation.

Method: AlcheMinT introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism for temporal intervals associated with subject identities, integrates with pretrained video generation models, uses subject-descriptive text tokens for identity binding, and employs token-wise concatenation without additional cross-attention modules.

Result: AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods while enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos, as demonstrated through benchmark evaluations of subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence.

Conclusion: AlcheMinT is a unified framework that successfully addresses the temporal control limitation in subject-driven video generation, enabling applications requiring precise timing of subject appearances and disappearances in multi-subject video synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

### [8] [SceneMaker: Open-set 3D Scene Generation with Decoupled De-occlusion and Pose Estimation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10957)
*Yukai Shi,Weiyu Li,Zihao Wang,Hongyang Li,Xingyu Chen,Ping Tan,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneMaker is a decoupled 3D scene generation framework that separates de-occlusion from object generation and uses unified pose estimation to handle severe occlusion in open-set scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with producing high-quality geometry and accurate poses simultaneously under severe occlusion and open-set settings due to insufficient de-occlusion and pose estimation priors.

Method: 1) Decouple de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, enhanced with image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for diverse occlusion patterns. 2) Propose unified pose estimation model integrating global and local mechanisms for self-attention and cross-attention. 3) Construct open-set 3D scene dataset to extend pose estimation generalization.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority of the decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes.

Conclusion: SceneMaker effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 3D scene generation through decoupled architecture and improved pose estimation, with released codes and datasets.

Abstract: We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decoupled framework on both indoor and open-set scenes. Our codes and datasets is released at https://idea-research.github.io/SceneMaker/.

### [9] [Quantifying Emotional Tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit: Dialogue Sentiment Analysis with RegEx, NRC-VAD, and Python](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10865)
*Lilin Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Computational analysis of emotional tone in Tolkien's The Hobbit dialogue reveals a generally positive, calm tone with increasing agency, showing how Tolkien balances tension with comfort throughout the narrative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the emotional structure of dialogue in Tolkien's The Hobbit using computational methods to uncover subtle emotional patterns that shape the storytelling.

Method: Dialogue extracted with regular expressions, preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance). Visualizations include emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds.

Result: Dialogue maintains generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone with gradually increasing agency (dominance). Shows emotional rhythm where danger/excitement are balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief.

Conclusion: Computational tools combined with literary interpretation can reveal subtle emotional structures in literature, demonstrating Tolkien's steady rhythm and emotional modulation in The Hobbit's storytelling.

Abstract: This study analyzes the emotional tone of dialogue in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.

### [10] [Computational emotion analysis with multimodal LLMs: Current evidence on an emerging methodological opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10882)
*Hauke Licht*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal LLMs show high reliability and low demographic bias for emotion analysis in ideal conditions, but fail in real-world parliamentary debates, highlighting need for continued evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While multimodal generative AI promises advances in analyzing emotions in political communication, there's a lack of evidence about its effectiveness in emotion analysis, particularly for video-based arousal assessment.

Method: Evaluated current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) using two complementary datasets of human-labeled video recordings, comparing performance in ideal circumstances versus real-world parliamentary debates.

Result: Under ideal conditions, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable with minimal demographic bias, but in real-world parliamentary debates, their arousal ratings fail to deliver accurate results, potentially harming downstream statistical inferences.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and provides a replicable framework for such assessments.

Abstract: Emotions are central to politics and analyzing their role in political communication has a long tradition. As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.

### [11] [LLMs Can Assist with Proposal Selection at Large User Facilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10895)
*Lijie Ding,Janell Thomson,Jon Taylor,Changwoo Do*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively rank scientific proposals at large facilities, matching human performance at much lower cost while enabling advanced analyses like similarity assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human proposal review suffers from bias, inconsistency, and weak inter-proposal correlations. Pairwise preference ranking is theoretically better but impractical for humans due to quadratic workload. LLMs offer a scalable, consistent, cost-effective alternative.

Method: Used LLMs to rank proposals from three beamlines at ORNL's Spallation Neutron Source, leveraging well-curated proposals and publication records. Employed pairwise preference-based approach that would be impractical for human reviewers due to quadratic scaling.

Result: LLM rankings strongly correlate with human rankings (Spearman ρ ≈ 0.2-0.8, improving to ≥0.5 after 10% outlier removal). LLMs perform no worse than humans in identifying proposals with high publication potential while costing over 100x less.

Conclusion: LLMs provide a viable, cost-effective alternative to human proposal review, offering consistent rankings and enabling advanced analyses like quantitative similarity assessment that are challenging for human committees.

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) can enhance the proposal selection process at large user facilities, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective alternative to traditional human review. Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $ρ\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\geq 0.5$ after 10\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.

### [12] [Multi-Granular Node Pruning for Circuit Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10903)
*Muhammad Umair Haider,Hammad Rizwan,Hassan Sajjad,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery in LLMs that uses learnable masks with granularity-specific sparsity penalties to identify minimal subnetworks at multiple levels (blocks to neurons) in a single fine-tuning run.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing circuit discovery methods rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units like attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. There's a need for more scalable and granular approaches.

Method: Proposes a node-level pruning framework with learnable masks across multiple granularity levels (entire blocks to individual neurons) within a unified optimization objective. Uses granularity-specific sparsity penalties to guide pruning, enabling comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run.

Result: The approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than prior methods, demonstrates that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant while maintaining task performance, and has 5-10x lower memory footprint by not requiring intermediate activations in memory.

Conclusion: The proposed node-level pruning framework addresses scalability and granularity limitations of existing circuit discovery methods, offering more efficient and fine-grained circuit identification with significantly reduced memory requirements.

Abstract: Circuit discovery aims to identify minimal subnetworks that are responsible for specific behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches primarily rely on iterative edge pruning, which is computationally expensive and limited to coarse-grained units such as attention heads or MLP blocks, overlooking finer structures like individual neurons. We propose a node-level pruning framework for circuit discovery that addresses both scalability and granularity limitations. Our method introduces learnable masks across multiple levels of granularity, from entire blocks to individual neurons, within a unified optimization objective. Granularity-specific sparsity penalties guide the pruning process, allowing a comprehensive compression in a single fine-tuning run. Empirically, our approach identifies circuits that are smaller in nodes than those discovered by prior methods; moreover, we demonstrate that many neurons deemed important by coarse methods are actually irrelevant, while still maintaining task performance. Furthermore, our method has a significantly lower memory footprint, 5-10x, as it does not require keeping intermediate activations in the memory to work.

### [13] [On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10937)
*Matt Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper establishes a formal correspondence between POMDP agents and quantum process functions, showing dual interpretations where process functions can represent either environments or agents depending on perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge concepts between artificial intelligence (decision-making agents in POMDPs) and quantum physics (process functions), revealing fundamental structural similarities between these seemingly different domains.

Method: The authors establish a precise mathematical correspondence where an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This creates dual interpretations: physics view (process function as environment) vs AI view (process function as agent).

Result: Successfully demonstrates that decision-making agents in POMDPs correspond to one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. Extends this to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as domains for multi-input process functions.

Conclusion: The paper reveals deep structural connections between AI decision theory and quantum process theory, suggesting that concepts from quantum foundations can inform agent design and vice versa, with potential applications in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments. We extend this perspective to multi-agent systems by identifying observation-independent decentralized POMDPs as natural domains for multi-input process functions.
