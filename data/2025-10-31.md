Abstract: Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have

### [2] [HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786)
*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships from data using graph-based hierarchies, decomposing global motions into parent-inherited patterns and local residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manually-defined or heuristic hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting generalizability across different tasks. There's a need for adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling.

Method: Formulates hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem using graph neural networks, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture parent-child dependencies.

Result: Successfully reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases, and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

Conclusion: Provides an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks across computer vision, graphics, and robotics.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

### [3] [SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796)
*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D is a pose-free video-to-4D framework that uses virtual cameras and view-conditional video inpainting to synthesize spatiotemporal content from casual videos without 3D supervision, outperforming trajectory-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-4D methods require manual camera pose annotations which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild videos. Warp-then-inpaint approaches still entangle camera motion with scene dynamics, complicating modeling and inference.

Method: Replaces trajectory prediction with rendering to fixed virtual cameras, separating camera control from scene modeling. Uses view-conditional video inpainting trained to denoise warped images and inpaint missing regions across viewpoints. Features spatiotemporal autoregressive inference with virtual-camera splines and overlapping windows.

Result: Validated on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Achieves superior generalization and improved performance compared to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines in both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical 4D world modeling from casual videos by eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations and providing a more robust framework that separates camera control from scene dynamics.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms in underwater object detection, comparing YOLOv5, T-YOLOv5, and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy for complex marine environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater object detection accuracy in dynamic marine environments with challenges like sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion by incorporating temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms.

Method: Two-phase approach: first evaluating T-YOLOv5 (temporal-enhanced YOLOv5) vs standard YOLOv5, then developing T-YOLOv5 with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to enhance spatial attention capabilities.

Result: T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM significantly outperformed standard YOLOv5: mAP@50-95 scores were 0.563 for YOLOv5, 0.813 for T-YOLOv5, and 0.811 for T-YOLOv5 with CBAM, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization for complex objects.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling in T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances detection reliability compared to standard YOLOv5, while CBAM integration further improves performance in challenging scenarios, though with some accuracy loss in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [5] [OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800)
*Yukun Huang,Jiwen Yu,Yanning Zhou,Jianan Wang,Xintao Wang,Pengfei Wan,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX is a unified framework that repurposes 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials to create graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically based rendering, relighting, and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance panorama-based 2D lifting techniques beyond appearance generation by enabling perception of intrinsic properties for creating physically realistic 3D environments suitable for professional graphics applications.

Method: Uses a lightweight cross-modal adapter structure to reuse 2D generative priors for panoramic vision tasks including perception, generation, and completion. Constructs a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset with high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation, enabling immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation.

Conclusion: OmniX opens new possibilities for creating graphics-ready 3D scenes by unifying panoramic perception and generation capabilities, advancing beyond traditional 2D lifting approaches that focus only on appearance.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

### [6] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO is a method that conditions text-to-image models on multiple reward models during training to directly learn user preferences, improving visual quality, training speed, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models trained on uncurated datasets don't align well with user preferences. Post-hoc reward model selection discards informative data and harms diversity, semantic fidelity, and efficiency.

Method: Instead of post-processing, MIRO conditions the model on multiple reward models during training to directly learn user preferences.

Result: MIRO dramatically improves visual quality of generated images and significantly speeds up training. It achieves state-of-the-art performances on GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Conclusion: Conditioning models on multiple reward models during training is more effective than post-hoc selection for aligning text-to-image generation with user preferences.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [7] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Result: Fine-tuning on the BikeScenes dataset achieved a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training is necessary and effective for bicycle-mounted perception systems, and the BikeScenes dataset serves as a valuable resource for advancing cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation research.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [8] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning approach using physics-informed synthetic data to repair and enhance STM images, enabling 2-4x faster acquisition and reduced tip conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STM limitations include tip degradation, slow serial data acquisition, and tip conditioning requirements after fabrication processes.

Method: Used 36 pristine Si(001):H images to train flow-matching and diffusion models with physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline.

Result: Models effectively restored images with 2-4x reduction in acquisition time, validated by CMMD score and structural similarity metrics.

Conclusion: Framework can significantly increase STM throughput by reducing tip conditioning frequency and enhancing frame rates in high-speed systems.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [9] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for image editing that semantically decomposes target prompts into sub-prompts, computes independent flows for each, and aggregates them to overcome limitations of rectified flow models in inversion accuracy and gradient entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models have limitations in image editing tasks including inaccurate inversion processes and gradient entanglement issues that prevent faithful reflection of target prompts. Existing ODE-based approaches without inversion still yield suboptimal editing quality.

Method: Proposes a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework: semantically decomposes target prompt into multiple sub-prompts, computes independent flow for each, aggregates them with projection and soft-aggregation mechanism inspired by multi-task learning gradient conflict resolution.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement. The method preserves both diversity and consistency in final edited output.

Conclusion: The proposed inversion-free flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework effectively addresses limitations of rectified flow models in image editing, achieving superior semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [10] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT is a brain-inspired fMRI-to-image reconstruction method that uses a Brain Interaction Transformer to enable effective interactions between functionally-similar brain-voxel clusters, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing images from fMRI brain recordings often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images, despite recent progress with diffusion models. The goal is to develop a more accurate and data-efficient approach.

Method: Uses a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) that allows interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional clusters are shared across subjects and serve as building blocks. BIT predicts two complementary patch-level image features: high-level semantic features for content guidance and low-level structural features for layout initialization in the diffusion process.

Result: Achieves faithful image reconstructions from fMRI that surpass current state-of-the-art approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. With only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, achieves comparable results to methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Conclusion: Brain-IT's brain-inspired approach with functional clusters and direct information flow from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features enables highly accurate and data-efficient fMRI-to-image reconstruction, significantly advancing the field.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [11] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a real-time tumor tracking method for cine-MRI sequences using SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts, achieving 0.8794 Dice score on TrackRAD2025 challenge while addressing data scarcity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor tracking in thoracic and abdominal cine-MRI sequences under strong data scarcity constraints, requiring methods that can work with limited labeled data.

Method: Used SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts from first annotated slice, fine-tuned on small labeled subset. Applied uniform low learning rate (0.0001) to all modules, trained for 300 epochs with 1024x1024 patches, batch size 1, and balanced Dice + IoU loss to prevent overfitting.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.8794 on hidden test set, ranking 6th overall in TrackRAD2025 challenge. The method maintained consistent performance across different anatomical sites and MRI field strengths.

Conclusion: Foundation models like SAM 2.1 show strong potential for accurate real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, effectively handling data scarcity while maintaining generalization across different clinical scenarios.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced Mamba framework with Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism increases Hausdorff dimension for better feature space exploration, improving low-light image enhancement performance while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information inconsistencies and improve spatial locality in Mamba-based models while maintaining long-range dependency handling capabilities.

Method: Proposes Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism that increases the Hausdorff dimension of Mamba's scanning pattern for more effective feature space exploration and fine-scale detail capture.

Result: Significantly improves both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, while reducing computational resource consumption and shortening inference time.

Conclusion: The refined strategy advances state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement and shows promise for broader applications in Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

Conclusion: CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs by providing a realistic and cognitively grounded benchmark.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN model for coastal flood prediction that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by reducing MAE by nearly 20%, generalizing across Abu Dhabi and San Francisco regions.


<details>

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL is a flexible in-context learning framework for segmenting bony regions in ultrasound images, achieving robust performance with only 5% labeled data across four wrist and elbow datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Elbow and wrist fractures are common in pediatric populations, and automatic segmentation in ultrasound can improve diagnostic accuracy. However, pixel-wise expert annotations for training deep learning models are time-consuming and costly.

Method: Proposed FlexICL framework for intra-video segmentation where experts annotate only a small subset of frames. Systematically investigated image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual in-context learning, introducing novel concatenation methods and integrating multiple augmentation strategies.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art visual ICL models (Painter, MAE-VQGAN) and conventional segmentation models (U-Net, TransUNet) by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. Achieved robust segmentation performance across four wrist and elbow US datasets using only 5% of training images.

Conclusion: FlexICL shows potential as an efficient and scalable solution for ultrasound image segmentation, particularly suitable for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional negative prompting uses fixed prompts, lacking contextual adaptation during the denoising process.

Method: Generate intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and query a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts.

Result: Evaluated on benchmark datasets, showing trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Proposed dynamic negative prompting method adaptively generates context-aware negative prompts, improving diffusion model performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PReMA is a novel adversarial attack that manipulates multi-modal diffusion models by modifying input images while keeping prompts fixed, enabling generation of inappropriate content without altering text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal diffusion models have inadequate alignment between text and image modalities, creating security risks for generating NSFW content. Current attacks focus on adversarial prompts, leaving image-based vulnerabilities unexplored.

Method: Proposes Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) that creates adversarial images to manipulate model outputs with any specified prompt. Unlike previous methods, it doesn't modify prompts but exploits the text-image misalignment.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models demonstrate PReMA's potent efficacy in manipulating generated content through adversarial images.

Conclusion: PReMA poses a novel threat to multi-modal diffusion model integrity, particularly in applications with fixed prompts, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities in current text-to-image alignment.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExo-Con benchmark evaluates Video-LLMs' temporal consistency across egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, revealing models struggle with cross-view consistency. Proposed View-GRPO framework improves consistency through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether Video-LLMs can achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints (egocentric vs exocentric).

Method: Introduced EgoExo-Con benchmark with synchronized video pairs and human-refined queries. Proposed View-GRPO reinforcement learning framework to strengthen view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints.

Result: Existing Video-LLMs fail to maintain consistency across viewpoints, performing worse than single-view. Naive fine-tuning with synchronized videos improves consistency but underperforms single-view training. View-GRPO demonstrates superiority over SFT and GRPO for improving cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: Cross-view temporal consistency is a critical limitation in Video-LLMs. View-GRPO effectively addresses this by strengthening view-specific reasoning while maintaining consistency across viewpoints.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: OracleAgent is the first agent system for Oracle Bone Script (OBS) research, integrating LLM-powered analysis tools and a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base with 1.4M character rubbings and 80K interpretation texts to address OBS interpretation complexity and retrieval inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OBS research faces challenges: complex interpretation workflows requiring multiple serial/parallel sub-tasks, and inefficient information organization/retrieval where scholars spend substantial effort searching and managing resources.

Method: Developed OracleAgent system that integrates multiple OBS analysis tools powered by LLMs, with flexible orchestration capabilities. Built a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base through multi-year data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation.

Result: OracleAgent achieves superior performance in multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading MLLMs like GPT-4o. Case studies show it significantly reduces time cost for OBS research and effectively assists domain experts in retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: OracleAgent represents a significant step toward practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems, demonstrating effective integration of domain-specific knowledge with modern AI capabilities.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without requiring pre-calibrated camera inputs, eliminating the need for external pose estimation tools like COLMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose estimation tools such as COLMAP, which introduce computational bottlenecks and propagate errors.

Method: Joint optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters and camera poses through a co-optimization strategy with two interleaved phases: updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and refining camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm with geometric and photometric constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality and surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse feature distributions.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively addresses limitations of traditional methods by eliminating dependency on external pose estimation tools while achieving superior reconstruction quality and pose accuracy through joint optimization.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WOD-E2E is a new dataset for end-to-end driving focusing on challenging long-tail scenarios, featuring 4,021 segments with routing info, ego states, and 360-degree camera views, along with a novel Rater Feedback Score metric for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks primarily test nominal scenarios and existing metrics fail to adequately evaluate performance in rare, challenging long-tail situations that are crucial for real-world autonomous driving safety.

Method: Created WOD-E2E dataset with 4,021 driving segments (12 hours) specifically curated for long-tail scenarios occurring less than 0.03% frequency. Each segment includes routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. Introduced Rater Feedback Score (RFS) metric that measures how closely predicted trajectories match rater-annotated preference labels.

Result: Developed comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework for challenging E2E driving scenarios. Released rater preference labels for validation set and established the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge with held-out test set labels.

Conclusion: WOD-E2E aims to advance research in generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving by providing a benchmark focused on rare but critical long-tail scenarios, enabling better evaluation of driving agents in complex real-world situations.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating gradient-based attention information with CNN features to improve RGB-D indoor SLAM performance, particularly for large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While attention models and visualization techniques like class activation mapping provide insights into CNN reasoning, explicit integration of gradient-based attention into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains limited, especially for visual tasks like SLAM where enriched representations could enhance performance.

Method: The approach integrates layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM systems.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance compared to baseline methods, with particularly notable enhancements for large environments.

Conclusion: Integrating task-specific network attention with CNN features effectively enhances SLAM performance, demonstrating the value of combining gradient-based attention mechanisms with traditional CNN representations for visual tasks.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullPart is a novel 3D part generation framework that combines implicit and explicit paradigms to generate detailed parts at full resolution, addressing limitations of previous methods that either lack geometric details or suffer from degraded quality for small parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous part generators using implicit vector-set tokens often lack sufficient geometric details, while explicit voxel-based methods with shared global grids cause small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to degraded quality. The motivation is to overcome these limitations by combining both paradigms.

Method: FullPart first derives bounding box layout through implicit box vector-set diffusion process, then generates detailed parts each within its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. It introduces center-point encoding to address misalignment between parts of different sizes and maintains global coherence.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. The method enables synthesis of intricate details even for small parts by generating each part at full resolution.

Conclusion: FullPart successfully combines implicit and explicit paradigms for 3D part generation, overcoming limitations of previous methods. The framework generates high-quality detailed parts while maintaining global coherence, and is supported by the newly created PartVerse-XL dataset with 40K objects and 320K parts.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Motivation: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution faces challenges in spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity across various scaling factors, requiring a flexible and efficient solution.

Method: Proposes BasicAVSR with four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency priors from Laplacian pyramids, 2) flow-guided propagation unit for spatiotemporal aggregation, 3) second-order motion compensation for accurate frame alignment, and 4) hyper-upsampling unit for scale-aware kernels. Offers three propagation variants for different application scenarios.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR advances state-of-the-art in arbitrary-scale video super-resolution and extends its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse application scenarios, providing an effective and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Motivation: Large annotated datasets for breast cancer CAD models are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Vision-Language Models offer a promising solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks.

Method: Proposes a Multi-View Mammography and Language Model trained on paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports using cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs, including multiple views and corresponding pseudo-radiology reports with a joint visual-textual learning strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in three classification tasks: malignancy classification, subtype classification, and image-based cancer risk prediction on both private and public datasets, while demonstrating strong data efficiency and outperforming fully supervised or VLM baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed MV-MLM model effectively leverages synthetic text reports and multi-view supervision to learn rich representations for breast cancer analysis, eliminating the need for actual radiology reports while achieving superior performance across multiple classification tasks.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively automates auto-rickshaw detection and the dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAG-MM is a comprehensive benchmark for multi-modal RAG with 6.5K image-question-answer triplets and 2K multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, designed for wearable device scenarios with egocentric images and real-world challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive benchmark for multi-modal RAG tasks, especially for wearable scenarios where users interact with their surroundings using devices like smart glasses.

Method: Created CRAG-MM benchmark with diverse dataset including 6.2K egocentric images, carefully constructed questions reflecting real-world challenges (image quality issues, question types, entity popularity, information dynamism), and designed three tasks with retrieval corpus and APIs.

Result: Baseline RAG approaches achieve only 32% truthfulness on single-turn QA and 43% on multi-turn QA, while state-of-the-art industry solutions show similar performance (32%/45%), indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM fills an important gap in multi-modal RAG benchmarking, has already attracted substantial community participation through KDD Cup 2025 with winning solutions improving baselines by 28%, and demonstrates the need for better multi-modal RAG systems.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

*Wontae Choi,Jaelin Lee,Hyung Sup Yun,Byeungwoo Jeon,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTDiff is a high-resolution motion trajectory estimation framework using diffusion models that extracts fine-grained motion information from single motion-blurred images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion representations from single blurred images are often low quality - coarse-grained and inaccurate. There's a need for high-resolution, high-quality motion trajectory estimation to improve computational imaging and computer vision applications.

Method: Proposes MoTDiff framework with two key components: 1) conditional diffusion framework using multi-scale feature maps from blurred images as conditions, and 2) training method promoting precise fine-grained motion trajectory identification, consistent shape/position estimation, and pixel connectivity along trajectories.

Result: MoTDiff demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Conclusion: The proposed MoTDiff framework successfully achieves high-resolution motion trajectory estimation from single motion-blurred images, representing the first diffusion-based approach for this task and showing significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

TL;DR: ConceptScope is an automated framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders on vision foundation models to discover and quantify human-interpretable concepts in datasets, enabling bias detection and dataset analysis without requiring fine-grained annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is common in machine learning but challenging to identify without costly manual annotations. There's a need for scalable, automated methods to systematically discover and quantify biases in visual datasets.

Method: ConceptScope uses Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models to discover interpretable concepts. It categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels.

Result: ConceptScope captures diverse visual concepts (objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, actions) and produces spatial attributions aligned with meaningful image regions. It reliably detects known biases and uncovers previously unannotated ones in datasets like Waterbirds and ImageNet.

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a practical tool for automated dataset auditing and model diagnostics, offering scalable bias identification and robustness evaluation through concept-based subgrouping without requiring expensive manual annotations.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling

evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for 3D human pose estimation from sketches using a 'learn from synthesis' strategy, creating a synthetic dataset SKEP-120K and combining diffusion models with neural networks for efficient pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sketch-to-pose methods face challenges due to abstract and disproportionate sketches, lack of large-scale annotations, and reliance on time-consuming optimization with limited generalizability.

Method: Train diffusion model to synthesize sketches from 2D poses, create SKEP-120K synthetic dataset, combine 2D pose detectors and diffusion priors with feed-forward neural network, and use heuristic loss functions for geometric coherence.

Result: The model substantially surpasses previous methods in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks, as shown by qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven framework effectively addresses sketch-to-pose challenges through synthetic data generation and efficient neural network architecture, achieving superior performance over previous approaches.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) is proposed for supply chain sustainability, achieving high accuracy in risk management (98.95%), product classification (100%), and relationship classification (98.07%) across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain sustainability is crucial for optimal performance, requiring effective risk management and product classification. Recent deep learning advances offer opportunities to analyze complex supply chain dependencies and hidden patterns.

Method: The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) combines convolutional and geometric deep learning to leverage information dependencies in supply chains and derive invisible states from database samples. It's evaluated on SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo databases.

Result: The method achieved 98.95% accuracy for risk management, 100% accuracy for 5-product group classification, 98.07% for 4-product relation classification, and 92.37% for 25-company relation classification, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The Ch-EGN ensemble network demonstrates superior performance in enhancing supply chain sustainability through effective risk administration and classification tasks, confirming its efficiency and improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniLayout-1M, a million-scale dataset for diverse document layouts, and OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with coarse-to-fine learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance on layout generation across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout generation remains underexplored compared to document layout analysis, with existing datasets dominated by academic papers and lacking diversity in open-world document types like newspapers and magazines.

Method: Created OmniLayout-1M dataset covering six document types, then developed OmniLayout-LLM with two-stage coarse-to-fine learning: first learning universal layout principles from coarse categories, then transferring to specific domains with fine-grained annotations.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing existing layout generation methods and several latest general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model effectively address the diversity gap in document layout generation and demonstrate superior performance across various document types.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

*Shiho Matta,Lis Kanashiro Pereira,Peitao Han,Fei Cheng,Shigeru Kitazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models struggle with temporal reasoning, performing poorly on judging whether videos play forward or backward compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have weak temporal understanding in videos and this capability is under-evaluated, despite their success in other multimodal tasks.

Method: Created AoT-PsyPhyBENCH benchmark using psychophysically validated stimuli to test VLMs' ability to judge temporal direction (forward vs backward) in natural videos, comparing against human behavioral baselines.

Result: Most VLMs perform near chance level, with even the best models lagging far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions that humans recognize instantly.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems - they capture visual-semantic correlations but lack inductive biases for temporal continuity and causal understanding.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCLFuse is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method inspired by human cognitive laws, using a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder and diffusion model with time-varying physical guidance to achieve state-of-the-art fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods struggle with balancing modal information, have limited generative capabilities, and lack interpretability in modal information selection, affecting reliability in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes HCLFuse with multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder using posterior probability modeling and information decomposition, combined with diffusion model's probabilistic generative capability integrated with physical laws through time-varying physical guidance mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates advantages in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality by drawing inspiration from human cognition for generative image fusion.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: To study the complementarity of different CNN architectures for periocular verification at varying distances and understand how their attention patterns differ, enabling improved performance through fusion techniques.

Method: Trained three CNN architectures (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) on VGGFace2 eye crops, analyzed performance with cosine and chi2 metrics, compared network initializations, applied score-level fusion via logistic regression, and used LIME heatmaps with Jensen-Shannon divergence for attention pattern comparison.

Result: ResNet50 performed best individually, but fusion provided substantial gains especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps revealed networks focus on distinct image regions, explaining their complementarity. The method significantly outperformed previous works on UBIPr, achieving new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Different CNN architectures exhibit complementary attention patterns for periocular verification, and their fusion significantly boosts performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the UBIPr database through strategic combination of networks with distinct focus areas.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in imitation learning methods and the inability of existing generative approaches to directly incorporate safety and physical constraints during trajectory generation, eliminating the need for additional optimization stages.

Method: Leverages Constrained Flow Matching to explicitly model the flow matching process, allowing flexible guidance from conditioning signals while imposing explicit safety and kinematic constraints directly within the generative process.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in NavSim v2 challenge with EPDMS score of 51.31 and received Innovation Award, demonstrating effective trajectory generation with safety constraints and controllable driving aggressiveness.

Conclusion: CATG successfully addresses key limitations in autonomous driving planning by combining flow matching with explicit constraint imposition, enabling diverse, safe trajectory generation with style control through driving aggressiveness parameterization.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

TL;DR: This paper evaluates three CNN architectures for periocular biometric recognition using a large-scale dataset of 1.9M ocular crops from VGGFace2, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UFPR-Periocular dataset with 1-2% EER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage periocular biometrics which offers high discrimination with minimal acquisition constraints, and address limitations of existing works that use small-scale datasets by utilizing large-scale training data.

Method: Evaluated three CNN architectures of varying depth/complexity trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops from VGGFace2 database, tested on VGGFace2-Pose (in-the-wild) and UFPR-Periocular (mobile selfies) datasets.

Result: VGGFace2-Pose: 9-15% EER with ocular crops vs 3-6% with full-face; UFPR-Periocular: 1-2% EER (lowest reported to date), with better performance attributed to higher image quality and consistent acquisition protocols.

Conclusion: Large-scale training significantly improves periocular recognition performance, with best results achieved on controlled acquisition datasets like UFPR-Periocular, establishing new state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AEOS-Bench, a large-scale benchmark suite for Agile Earth Observation Satellites constellation scheduling, and AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based scheduling model with constraint-aware attention that outperforms baselines in task completion and energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AEOS scheduling methods often simplify the complexities of large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent constraints, limiting their real-world performance. There is a need for more realistic and comprehensive approaches.

Method: The authors developed AEOS-Bench benchmark suite with 3,907 satellite assets and 16,410 scenarios generated via high-fidelity simulation. They also created AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based scheduling model with constraint-aware attention mechanism and internal constraint module that explicitly models physical and operational satellite limits through simulation-based iterative learning.

Result: Experimental results show that AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in both task completion and energy efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component in the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified framework for AEOS constellation scheduling that addresses real-world complexities through a comprehensive benchmark suite and a novel Transformer-based model, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Junlai Qiu,Yunzhu Chen,Hao Zheng,Yawen Huang,Yuexiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel evidential fusion paradigm that combines CNN and ViT backbones for diabetic retinopathy grading, leveraging local and global feature extraction capabilities to overcome performance bottlenecks of single-type backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, and existing automated diagnosis systems using single-type backbones (CNN or ViT) have reached performance limitations due to their inherent shortcomings. Integrating different backbones can leverage CNN's local feature extraction and ViT's global feature capturing capabilities.

Method: Proposes an evidential fusion paradigm that transforms features from different backbones into supporting evidences via deep evidential networks. The aggregated opinion adaptively tunes fusion patterns between backbones to boost hybrid model performance.

Result: Evaluated on two publicly available DR grading datasets, the hybrid model improves DR grading accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks and provides excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.

Conclusion: The evidential fusion approach effectively combines CNN and ViT strengths, overcoming single-backbone limitations and achieving superior DR grading performance with enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-conditioning framework combining EEG embeddings with spatial saliency maps improves EEG-driven image reconstruction by enhancing fidelity and semantic coherence through spatial attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods lack spatial attention mechanisms, which limits their ability to produce high-fidelity and semantically coherent images from neural signals.

Method: Proposes a dual-conditioning framework using Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via LoRA for neural-visual alignment, and incorporates ControlNet for spatial conditioning via saliency maps.

Result: Achieves significant improvement in quality of both low- and high-level image features on THINGS-EEG dataset, with strong alignment to human visual attention patterns.

Conclusion: Attentional priors effectively resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions that advance neural decoding applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating long video generation under complex prompts, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by introducing realistic prompts and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics including event-level alignment, temporal consistency, and abstract narrative qualities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation evaluation focuses on short, simple prompts and low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with complex prompts and abstract dimensions like narrative coherence and thematic expression in long-form videos.

Method: Proposed LoCoT2V-Bench benchmark based on real-world videos, featuring realistic complex prompts with scene transitions and event dynamics. Introduced multi-dimensional evaluation framework with new metrics: event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) for narrative flow, emotional response, and character development.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of nine representative long video generation models revealed that while current methods perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement, particularly in handling complex narrative structures and abstract thematic elements.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [44] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TPT is a novel test-time prompt tuning framework that improves vision-language model calibration by maximizing angular diversity between class-wise textual features on the unit hypersphere, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in reducing calibration error while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time prompt tuning methods focus on maximizing average textual feature dispersion or enforcing orthogonality, but they may not achieve optimal angular separation between class-wise features, which hurts calibration performance and raises reliability concerns for vision-language models.

Method: The proposed A-TPT framework introduces angular diversity by encouraging uniformity in the distribution of normalized textual features through maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between features on the unit hypersphere.

Result: Extensive experiments show A-TPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy across various backbones and datasets, with superior zero-shot calibration on natural distribution shifts and good generalization to medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity achieves well-dispersed textual features and significantly improves vision-language model calibration during test-time adaptation, establishing the effectiveness of the A-TPT approach.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [45] [PointSt3R: Point Tracking through 3D Grounded Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26443)
*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper adapts foundational 3D reconstruction models (DUSt3R and MASt3R) for point tracking using 3D grounded correspondence, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks while focusing on frame pairs without temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage recent advances in 3D reconstruction models for point tracking tasks, particularly addressing both static and dynamic point correspondence in a temporally limited context.

Method: Combines reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training and a visibility head, fine-tunes MASt3R on synthetic data, and evaluates on frame pairs containing query points without temporal context.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance on four datasets: TAP-Vid-DAVIS (73.8 δ_avg / 85.8% occlusion accuracy), EgoPoints (61.3 vs 54.2), and RGB-S (87.0 vs 82.8), outperforming CoTracker2 and CoTracker3 in several benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that 3D reconstruction models can be effectively adapted for point tracking tasks, achieving strong performance with minimal temporal context and showing particular strength in handling both static and dynamic point correspondences.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [46] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineGrainedAD is a novel framework for few-shot anomaly detection that addresses semantic misalignment between text descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies by introducing multi-level fine-grained semantic captions and alignment mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-shot anomaly detection methods suffer from semantic misalignment between image-level text descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, leading to suboptimal localization performance due to lack of detailed textual descriptions.

Method: Proposes Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) for automatic multi-level textual descriptions, Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) for fine-grained semantic integration, and Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) with region aggregation and alignment training.

Result: FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses semantic misalignment in few-shot anomaly detection through multi-level fine-grained semantic descriptions and alignment mechanisms, significantly improving anomaly localization performance.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

### [47] [Representation-Level Counterfactual Calibration for Debiased Zero-Shot Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26466)
*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causal inference approach that addresses object-context shortcuts in vision-language models by synthesizing counterfactual embeddings through object-background recombination and estimating Total Direct Effect to improve zero-shot reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-context shortcuts in vision-language models undermine zero-shot reliability when test scenes differ from familiar training co-occurrences, creating persistent challenges for model robustness.

Method: Estimate object and background expectations in CLIP's representation space, synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse alternative contexts, and use Total Direct Effect estimation to subtract background-only activation while preserving beneficial object-context interactions.

Result: Substantially improves both worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks without retraining or prompt design, establishing new zero-shot state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach that offers a practical causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

### [48] [Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through Head-Tail Re-balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26474)
*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a "Matthew effect" in self-improvement of LVLMs where models prioritize simple queries over complex ones, leading to imbalanced optimization. It proposes distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling strategies to re-balance head-tail data during self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improvement in LVLMs suffers from imbalanced optimization where models excel at simple queries but struggle with complex ones, creating a performance bottleneck as the imbalance worsens over iterations.

Method: Proposes four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the self-improvement exploration-and-learning process.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models show consistent improvement in visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: The proposed head-tail re-balancing strategies effectively counteract the Matthew effect in self-improvement, enabling better optimization across both simple and complex reasoning tasks and overcoming performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

*Vinícius Ferraria,Eurico Ruivo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An adaptable edge detector using 2D cellular automaton optimized by meta-heuristics with transfer learning was developed to address weaknesses in detecting loose edges and lack of context. The study found that expanding the optimization search space was ineffective and transfer learning provided no significant improvements, though the model could adapt to inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weaknesses in edge detection such as difficulty detecting loose edges and lack of context for extracting relevant information from specific problems, and to create an adaptable detector that can adjust to image properties.

Method: Developed an adaptable edge detector using two-dimensional cellular automaton optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning techniques. Analyzed impact of expanding search space in optimization phase and robustness of adaptability on natural images and specialized subsets.

Result: Expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not effective for the chosen image set. The model was able to adapt to input regardless of validation, but transfer learning techniques showed no significant improvements.

Conclusion: The adaptable edge detector based on cellular automaton can adapt to inputs, but expanding optimization search space was ineffective and transfer learning did not provide meaningful enhancements for the tested image set.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

*Hao Xie,Zixun Huang,Yushen Zuo,Yakun Ju,Frank H. F. Leung,N. F. Law,Kin-Man Lam,Yong-Ping Zheng,Sai Ho Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SA²Net is a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network for spine segmentation in ultrasound volume projection imaging, addressing challenges in learning global contextual knowledge and encoding structural bone features through cross-dimensional correlation learning and structure-affinity transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine segmentation from ultrasound VPI is crucial for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis but faces challenges: poor learning of global contextual knowledge due to neglected spatial correlation of bone features, and insufficient encoding of rich structural knowledge about spine bone shapes and positions.

Method: Proposes SA²Net with: 1) scale-adaptive complementary strategy for cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features, 2) structure-affinity transformation that combines semantic features with class-specific affinity using Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning, and 3) feature mixing loss aggregation for enhanced model training.

Result: Experimental results show SA²Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, with improved robustness and accuracy in the segmentation process.

Conclusion: SA²Net demonstrates strong potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis through intelligent spinal image analysis, with adaptability to various backbones enhancing its practical applicability.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated video ad clipping framework using audio-visual fusion model for shot selection, outperforming existing methods on multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual video ad clipping is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring automated solutions for creating multiple ad versions at different durations.

Method: Two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts frame importance based on likelihood of selection in firm-produced short ads, using novel AdSum204 dataset.

Result: Model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall metrics.

Conclusion: Audio-visual fusion approach effectively automates video ad clipping by emphasizing audio's role in advertising, with superior performance over visual-only methods.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems struggle with unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, limiting deployment in dynamic environments. Need for generalization across unseen contexts without task-specific training.

Method: Integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions. Uses dynamic reasoning module combining global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.

Conclusion: Framework provides scalable and interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH is a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain VQA adaptation that uses lightweight domain classifier and dual adapters to improve generalization without retraining backbone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA models like LLaVA perform well on natural images but degrade significantly in out-of-domain scenarios (remote sensing, medical imaging, math diagrams) due to distributional shifts and lack of domain adaptation mechanisms. Existing approaches require costly per-domain fine-tuning.

Method: Decouples visual and linguistic adaptation using two lightweight modules: domain classifier to identify input image type, and dual adapter mechanism (Prompt Adapter for language modulation and Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment) dynamically injected via unified hook interface.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks: +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA without retraining backbone model.

Conclusion: CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Emu3.5 is a large-scale multimodal world model that predicts next states across vision and language using unified next-token prediction on 10+ trillion tokens of video data, with enhanced reasoning via reinforcement learning and 20x faster inference through Discrete Diffusion Adaptation.

Motivation: To create a unified multimodal world model that can naturally handle interleaved vision-language inputs and outputs, enabling complex multimodal reasoning, generation, and embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios.

Method: End-to-end pre-training with unified next-token prediction on vision-language interleaved data from internet videos, followed by large-scale reinforcement learning post-training, and Discrete Diffusion Adaptation for efficient bidirectional parallel prediction.

Result: Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image on generation/editing tasks, superior results on interleaved generation tasks, and demonstrates strong capabilities in long-horizon vision-language generation, X2I generation, text-rich image generation, and open-world embodied manipulation.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 represents a significant advancement in multimodal world modeling, offering native interleaved vision-language capabilities, efficient inference, and generalizable world-modeling abilities for diverse applications, with open-source availability to support community research.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

### [55] [ResMatching: Noise-Resilient Computational Super-Resolution via Guided Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26601)
*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching is a novel computational super-resolution method using guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors, achieving the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism across diverse biological structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational super-resolution in fluorescence microscopy is an ill-posed problem that requires strong priors to extrapolate missing frequencies. With better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger priors can be learned to improve CSR results.

Method: ResMatching uses guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors for computational super-resolution. It can sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.

Result: ResMatching consistently achieved competitive results across 4 diverse biological structures from BioSR dataset, outperforming 7 baselines. It demonstrated the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism in all cases, particularly effective with noisy low-resolution images.

Conclusion: ResMatching is an effective CSR method that learns strong data priors through guided conditional flow matching, delivers calibrated uncertainty estimates, and performs well especially when dealing with noisy input data where strong priors are hard to learn.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spiking Patches tokenizer preserves event camera properties (asynchronous, sparse) while matching/surpassing frame/voxel accuracy with 3.4-10.4x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover event representation that preserves asynchronous and spatially sparse properties of event cameras, overcoming limitations of frame/voxel methods that lose these properties.

Method: Propose Spiking Patches tokenizer that converts event streams into tokens while maintaining asynchronous and sparse characteristics, evaluated with GNN, PCN, and Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection.

Result: 3.4x faster inference than voxels, 10.4x faster than frames; matches accuracy and achieves absolute improvements up to 3.8% for gesture recognition and 1.4% for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization represents a novel direction in event-based vision that preserves event camera properties without sacrificing accuracy, enabling more efficient processing.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Conclusion: The paper delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities in autonomous vehicle object detection, emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging AI paradigms like VLMs, LLMs, and Generative AI.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning optical flow models achieve sub-kilometer accuracy for sea ice drift estimation using RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR imagery, outperforming classical methods and providing spatially continuous motion fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sea ice drift estimation is critical for Arctic navigation, climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow has advanced in computer vision, its application to satellite SAR imagery and geophysical problems remains underexplored.

Method: First large-scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and F1-all metrics against GNSS-tracked buoys.

Result: Several models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), capturing consistent regional drift patterns. Deep learning methods substantially improved motion estimation accuracy compared to classical approaches.

Conclusion: Recent deep learning optical flow methods can be effectively transferred to polar remote sensing, providing spatially continuous drift fields that offer new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes two scene-based information fusion techniques to improve object detection in occluded scenarios using RPN-DCNN networks, showing improved recall and precision on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions present substantial challenges to object recognition algorithms, and scene context can provide valuable additional information to reduce errors caused by occlusions in biological vision.

Method: Two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques: (1) selecting custom object networks based on identified background scene before prediction, and (2) fusing scene knowledge into initial object scores after detection from RPN.

Result: Demonstrated overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods on challenging datasets with partial occlusions. Training on combination of occluded and unoccluded images showed improvement over other training methodologies.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, easily adaptable to other datasets, and offers many future directions for research and practical applications in handling occlusions in object detection.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework that transfers knowledge from video generation (ViGen) to 3D human motion generation (MoGen) through data integration, unified modeling, and comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human motion generation models face generalization bottlenecks, while video generation has demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, suggesting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage.

Method: The framework includes: 1) ViMoGen-228K dataset integrating MoCap data, web videos, and ViGen-generated samples; 2) ViMoGen - a flow-matching diffusion transformer with gated multimodal conditioning; 3) ViMoGen-light - a distilled variant without video dependencies; 4) MBench - a hierarchical evaluation benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrating improved generalization and motion quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully transfers knowledge from video generation to motion generation, addressing generalization bottlenecks through systematic data integration, unified modeling, and comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining proxy classification and aerial imagery embeddings achieves fine-grained geo-localization across continental scales, enabling 68% of queries to be localized within 200m across Europe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image retrieval techniques are inefficient for global scale geo-localization due to large image volumes (>100M) and insufficient coverage, while existing scalable solutions either yield coarse results (10+ km) or suffer from domain gaps in cross-view retrieval.

Method: Uses a proxy classification task during training to learn rich feature representations encoding precise location information, combined with embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to ground-level data sparsity.

Result: The approach can localize within 200m more than 68% of queries on a dataset covering a large part of Europe, demonstrating fine-grained retrieval across multiple countries.

Conclusion: The hybrid method successfully achieves fine-grained geo-localization at continental scale by leveraging learned prototypes and aerial imagery embeddings, overcoming limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: Masked diffusion captioning (MDC) learns visual features by reconstructing masked text tokens from images using diffusion models, achieving competitive performance with autoregressive and contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative to autoregressive captioning that provides stronger visual learning signals independent of token position, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives.

Method: Train an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model where text tokens are randomly masked and a decoder reconstructs original text using visual features from images.

Result: Linear probing experiments show MDC-learned visual features are competitive with autoregressive and contrastive approaches across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: MDC provides an effective framework for visual feature learning that doesn't depend on token position and achieves performance comparable to established methods.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

*Ziyu Guo,Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Ruichuan An,Yu Qi,Dongzhi Jiang,Xiangtai Li,Manyuan Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether current video generation models like Veo-3 can serve as zero-shot visual reasoners, evaluating them across 12 reasoning dimensions and finding they show promise in short-term spatial coherence but lack long-horizon causal reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if video generation models, which can produce high-fidelity videos and show emerging visual perception behaviors, are ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios.

Method: Conducted an empirical study evaluating Veo-3 across 12 reasoning dimensions (spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, embodied logic) using the curated MME-CoF benchmark for Chain-of-Frame reasoning assessment.

Result: Video models demonstrate promising reasoning on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, but are limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners but show encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

### [69] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' approximation abilities in informal mathematical reasoning, finding that models tend to compute exact values rather than approximate even when approximation is appropriate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding LLMs' ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced mathematical operations, particularly for non-autoregressive decoder models.

Method: Created StreetMath benchmark for real-world approximation scenarios, evaluated multiple LLM architectures, and applied mechanistic interpretability techniques to probe internal computational states.

Result: LLMs generally compute exact values or use external tools even when approximation is called for, consume more tokens for approximation tasks, and use separate neural components for exact vs approximate arithmetic.

Conclusion: LLMs do not exhibit cognitive miserliness like humans in street math settings, showing fundamental differences in how they approach approximate reasoning compared to human cognition.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [70] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach for sentiment analysis that classifies opinions into granular strength levels (very weak to very strong) by combining opinion words related to specific product aspects, addressing the limitation of traditional lexicon-based methods that don't consider opinion strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional holistic lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches fail to capture the varying strength levels of opinions (from very weak to very strong), which limits their effectiveness in accurately ranking entities based on user reviews and queries.

Method: The approach uses fuzzy logic algorithms to classify opinion words into different strength categories and employs syntactic dependency resolution to identify relationships between opinion words and desired aspect words. It considers opinion words (adverbs, adjectives, nouns, verbs) related to specific product aspects.

Result: The method enables calculation of entity scores for specific aspects in reviews by considering the strength and orientation of opinion words, allowing for more nuanced sentiment analysis and entity ranking.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a more granular and accurate sentiment analysis framework that can effectively rank entities based on the strength and orientation of opinions expressed in reviews, overcoming limitations of traditional lexicon-based methods.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASTIST, a large-scale Korean dataset for target-independent stance detection, addressing the lack of resources in low-resource languages for this emerging AI field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research focuses on target-dependent tasks and English datasets, creating a gap for low-resource languages like Korean in this emerging field.

Method: Collected 563,299 labeled Korean sentences from press releases of Korean political parties and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and stance detection models.

Result: Created the LASTIST dataset designed for target-independent stance detection and diachronic evolution stance detection tasks.

Conclusion: The LASTIST dataset fills the research gap for Korean stance detection and is available for various stance detection tasks, supporting development in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes zFLoRA, a zero-latency fused low-rank adapter that eliminates inference overhead while maintaining performance comparable to LoRA and full fine-tuning across 18 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-specific adapters in LLMs, despite having small parameter counts (<1% of base model), cause significant inference latency (up to 2.5x base model), creating deployment bottlenecks.

Method: Develops a fused low-rank adapter (zFLoRA) that integrates adapter parameters into the base model without additional computational overhead during inference.

Result: zFLoRA achieves comparable performance to LoRA and full fine-tuning across 18 tasks in commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue, while introducing zero to negligible latency on both NPU and GPU platforms.

Conclusion: zFLoRA enables efficient deployment of task-specific LLMs without inference latency penalties, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes three improvements to circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability: bootstrapping for consistent attribution scores, ratio-based edge selection, and integer linear programming instead of greedy selection, achieving better performance and faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability by improving the identification of which model parts perform specific tasks.

Method: Three key improvements: 1) bootstrapping for consistent attribution scores, 2) ratio-based selection strategy for prioritizing strong positive-scoring edges, 3) replacing greedy selection with integer linear programming formulation.

Result: The methods yield more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) tasks and models.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements successfully enhance circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability, providing more reliable identification of model components responsible for specific tasks.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN framework uses LLMs as zero-shot preference oracles to help experts select optimal options from large sets with multiple objectives, using natural language guidance instead of formal preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts struggle with selecting best options from large sets with competing objectives due to difficulty formalizing complex implicit preferences, creating a process bottleneck.

Method: Two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U (refines parametric utility function using LLM) and LISTEN-T (non-parametric tournament-style selections over small batches). Uses LLM as zero-shot preference oracle guided by natural language priorities.

Result: Evaluated on flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling tasks. LISTEN-U excels when preferences are parametrically aligned (measured by novel concordance metric), while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance across scenarios.

Conclusion: LISTEN framework provides promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural language, reducing cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation methods.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter is a framework that identifies training data with meaningful long-distance dependencies for efficient long-context pretraining by comparing model predictions with long vs short contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies, making training inefficient. Careful data selection is crucial for effective long-context language model training.

Method: LongFilter measures information gain by contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings to identify samples where long-range dependencies are essential.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B extending context from 8K to 64K tokens show LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on HELMET, LongBench, and RULER benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongFilter provides an effective framework for curating training data specifically tailored for long-context pretraining, addressing the inefficiency of training on data lacking meaningful long-distance dependencies.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona adoption in LLMs introduces subtle ideological biases in harmful content classification, with models showing stronger alignment with personas from the same political ideology while widening divergence across ideological groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities, as LLMs are increasingly used in content moderation systems where fairness and neutrality are essential.

Method: Analyzed persona adoption effects across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities (language vs. vision), including agreement analyses and an additional study on politically targeted tasks to examine ideological alignment and behavioral shifts.

Result: Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful. Larger models tend to align more closely with personas from the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological groups. Personas behave more coherently within their own ideology and exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality in content moderation applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR method uses entity-aware retrieval for clinical question answering, achieving better performance (F1=0.90) than embedding-based methods while using 70% fewer tokens, with particularly strong results on long clinical notes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR clinical documentation is stored as base64 encoded attachments, making semantic question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships.

Method: Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method using entity-aware retrieval, validated against zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based retrieval augmented generation on a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform with 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens.

Result: CLEAR achieved 58.3% win rate, average semantic similarity of 0.878, used 78% fewer tokens than wide context processing, and showed 75% win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. F1 score of 0.90 vs 0.86 for embedding-based retrieval.

Conclusion: Entity-aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical NLP, with the evaluation framework providing a reusable benchmark for assessing clinical QA systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key

compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLM-based semantic role labeling for FrameNet annotation, comparing manual, automatic, and semi-automatic approaches. Semi-automatic annotation shows improved frame diversity with similar coverage to manual annotation, while fully automatic performs poorly except for speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in comprehensive evaluation of LLM tools for creating annotated datasets, particularly under perspectivized NLP approaches, by assessing their impact on semantic annotation quality and efficiency.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three annotation settings: manual, automatic (LLM-only), and semi-automatic (human-LLM hybrid). Metrics include annotation time, coverage, and frame diversity.

Result: Semi-automatic annotation achieved increased frame diversity and similar annotation coverage compared to manual annotation. Fully automatic annotation performed worse in all metrics except annotation time.

Conclusion: Hybrid semi-automatic annotation using LLMs provides the best balance, improving frame diversity while maintaining coverage, making it more effective than fully automatic approaches for semantic annotation tasks.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

TL;DR: RECAP is an agentic pipeline that extracts and verifies memorized training data from LLMs using a feedback-driven loop with correction hints and jailbreaking to overcome alignment refusals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine what content LLMs have seen in their training data when direct inspection is impossible, by eliciting and verifying memorized data through model outputs.

Method: Uses a feedback loop where initial extraction is evaluated by a secondary model, discrepancies are identified and converted to correction hints, then fed back to guide subsequent generations. Includes jailbreaking module to overcome alignment refusals.

Result: On EchoTrace benchmark spanning 30+ books, RECAP achieved substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. With GPT-4.1, ROUGE-L score for copyrighted text extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 (24% increase).

Conclusion: RECAP effectively extracts memorized training data from LLMs through iterative refinement and jailbreaking, demonstrating significant improvement over baseline methods.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study challenges common assumptions about multilingual LLM training, finding that combining English and multilingual data doesn't degrade performance when languages have sufficient tokens, English serves as an effective pivot language across families, and no significant 'curse of multilinguality' exists at 1.1B-3B parameter scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining LLMs and address ongoing debates about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model performance (the curse of multilinguality).

Method: Training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400, and analyzing the effects of language combinations and pivot language strategies.

Result: Combining English and multilingual data doesn't degrade performance when languages have sufficient tokens; English as pivot language benefits all language families; no significant curse of multilinguality observed at this scale; multilingual data can enhance capabilities without compromising performance.

Conclusion: Multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings, challenging common beliefs about multilingual training trade-offs.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

### [82] [Semantic Label Drift in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25967)
*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine Translation systems, including LLMs, cause label drift during translation due to cultural divergence, particularly in culturally sensitive domains, with cultural similarity between languages being crucial for label preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored role of cultural alignment in Machine Translation and how cultural divergence affects semantic label preservation during translation.

Method: Conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains using various MT systems including modern LLMs, analyzing label drift patterns and cultural knowledge encoding.

Result: Found that MT systems induce label drift, LLMs encode cultural knowledge that amplifies drift, and cultural similarity between languages is a key determinant of label preservation.

Conclusion: Neglecting cultural factors in MT undermines label fidelity and risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

*Sina Bagheri Nezhad,Yao Li,Ameeta Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SymCode is a neurosymbolic framework that improves mathematical reasoning in LLMs by generating verifiable SymPy code instead of prose, achieving up to 13.6% accuracy gains on benchmarks while making errors more transparent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions, lacking deterministic verification mechanisms.

Method: Reframes mathematical problem-solving as verifiable code generation using the SymPy library, creating a neurosymbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine.

Result: Significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines on challenging benchmarks (MATH-500 and OlympiadBench), with better token efficiency and more transparent error patterns.

Conclusion: SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy AI in formal domains by shifting model failures from opaque logical fallacies to transparent programmatic errors through symbolic grounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents optimized matrix multiplication techniques for LLM inference on AWS Trainium AI accelerators, achieving significant performance improvements over existing implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AWS Trainium AI accelerators offer cost-effective solutions for LLM workloads but present challenges due to their systolic array architecture and data layout requirements, making high-performance optimization difficult.

Method: Developed customized techniques for Trainium including kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose operations.

Result: Evaluation across nine datasets and four recent LLMs showed average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x) at matmul kernel level, translating to average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference compared to AWS's state-of-the-art implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization techniques successfully address Trainium's architectural challenges and deliver substantial performance improvements for LLM inference workloads.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache accelerates LLM prefill inference by caching and reusing similar attention maps, reducing self-attention computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world workloads rely on prefill-only inference where self-attention's quadratic complexity becomes a performance bottleneck.

Method: Proposes AttnCache framework that builds an attention map memorization database and uses efficient caching and similarity search to retrieve and reuse similar attention maps during inference.

Result: Achieves 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU with negligible accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: AttnCache effectively accelerates prefill-stage LLM inference by exploiting attention map similarity across different inputs while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: SRL is a new training framework that combines supervised learning and reinforcement learning to improve multi-step reasoning in small LLMs by generating logical action sequences with internal reasoning monologues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods: RLVR fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled, while SFT overfits through rigid token-by-token imitation of long demonstrations.

Method: Reformulates problem solving as generating sequences of logical actions. Trains models to generate internal reasoning monologues before each action, providing smoother step-wise rewards based on similarity between model actions and expert actions from SFT dataset.

Result: Enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Combining SRL initialization with RLVR refinement yields strongest performance. Generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: SRL establishes a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs that provides richer learning signals and encourages flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

*Feijie Wu,Weiwu Zhu,Yuxiang Zhang,Soumya Chatterjee,Jiarong Zhu,Fan Mo,Rodin Luo,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool is a reinforcement learning method that trains tool-use LLMs to explore multiple solution trajectories in dynamic tool-call environments, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use LLMs trained on static datasets fail to explore alternative solutions and perform poorly in dynamic tool-call environments, limiting their reasoning capabilities.

Method: PORTool uses RL to generate multiple rollouts forming tree-like structures, assigns step-wise rewards based on answer correctness and tool-call success, and calculates fork-relative advantages blended with trajectory-relative advantages for training.

Result: Experiments with 17 tools show significant improvements in final accuracy and reduction in tool-call steps compared to other training approaches, with ablation studies validating the design.

Conclusion: PORTool effectively enhances tool-use LLMs' exploration capabilities and performance in dynamic environments through structured RL training with step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

### [88] [Rethinking Cross-lingual Alignment: Balancing Transfer and Cultural Erasure in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26024)
*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a trade-off in cross-lingual alignment where improving factual knowledge transfer across languages inadvertently causes cultural erasure. The authors propose a new evaluation framework and a surgical steering method that balances these competing objectives by targeting different model layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-lingual alignment approaches focus on aligning multilingual representations but may cause cultural erasure - the loss of culturally-situated responses that should differ based on query language. The authors aim to address this trade-off between knowledge transfer and cultural preservation.

Method: The authors introduce a transfer-localization plane evaluation framework to quantify both knowledge transfer and cultural erasure. They analyze model representations and propose Surgical Steering - an inference-time method that applies targeted activation steering to distinct model layers to disentangle factual transfer from culturally-specific knowledge.

Result: Evaluation of recent CLA approaches shows they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across six languages. The analysis reveals that universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers. Surgical Steering achieves better balance between these competing dimensions.

Conclusion: Cross-lingual alignment creates a fundamental trade-off between knowledge transfer and cultural preservation. By understanding that these objectives operate optimally at different model layers, targeted activation steering can effectively overcome limitations of current alignment techniques and achieve better balance.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study developed an NLP pipeline to analyze incidental thyroid findings in radiology reports, finding that 7.8% of patients had ITFs which strongly predicted downstream thyroid procedures and cancer diagnosis, highlighting overdiagnosis concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incidental thyroid findings are increasingly detected on imaging but their prevalence, characteristics, and clinical consequences remain poorly defined, necessitating systematic analysis.

Method: Retrospective cohort study using transformer-based NLP pipeline to identify incidental thyroid findings from radiology reports across multiple imaging modalities from 2017-2023 at Mayo Clinic sites.

Result: Among 115,683 patients, 7.8% had incidental thyroid findings (92.9% nodules). ITFs were associated with higher rates of thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary and larger when detected after ITFs.

Conclusion: ITFs are common and strongly associated with diagnostic cascades leading to detection of small, low-risk cancers, underscoring their role in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and selective follow-up.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark is an evaluation framework for assessing LLMs on quantum programming tasks with hardware simulation feedback, showing that reasoning-based models significantly outperform conventional models and even human coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs for quantum programming domains that require interaction with hardware devices, where conventional code generation approaches are insufficient.

Method: Introduces QCoder Benchmark with quantum simulator environment support for domain-specific metrics (circuit depth, execution time, error classification) and incorporates human-written code from real programming contests for comparative analysis.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only 18.97% accuracy, while reasoning-based models like o3 reach 78% accuracy, outperforming human-written code success rates (39.98%).

Conclusion: QCoder Benchmark demonstrates the significant challenge of quantum programming for LLMs and shows reasoning-based approaches are more effective, with the framework released to support further research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm to address low diversity in LLM outputs caused by traditional "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training. It introduces Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) metric to measure semantic differences in reasoning paths and uses it to curate diverse training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning but suffers from low output diversity due to 1P1S training that provides single canonical answers, pushing models toward narrow reasoning paths.

Method: Propose 1PNS training paradigm with Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) metric to measure semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought. Use RPD to curate maximally diverse solution sets and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base model.

Result: RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with average +2.80% gain in pass@16 over 1P1S baseline and +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating 1PNS amplifies TTS effectiveness.

Conclusion: 1PNS training paradigm with RPD metric successfully increases inference diversity and improves reasoning performance, showing that exposing models to diverse reasoning paths enhances test-time scaling effectiveness.

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

TL;DR: This study uses LLMs and prompt engineering to analyze the relationship between persuasion techniques and discourse relations, creating silver datasets that reveal six key discourse relations are crucial in persuasive texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between persuasion techniques and discourse relations since no existing dataset contains both annotations, with applications in detecting online propaganda and understanding effective communication.

Method: Used SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset with 19 PTs, developed LLM-based classifiers with 4 LLMs and 10 prompts to label with 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 discourse relations, created ensemble models with majority-pooling strategies to generate 5 silver datasets.

Result: Created silver datasets ranging from 1,281 to 204 instances, statistical analysis identified six crucial discourse relations (Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, Condition) that play key roles in persuasive texts, particularly with Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition, and Doubt techniques.

Conclusion: The findings reveal specific discourse relations that are instrumental in persuasion, contributing to better detection of online propaganda and misinformation, and advancing understanding of effective communication strategies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve statistical efficiency by reducing abstentions in language models through better calibration of high-probability regions.

Method: Convert existing pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs into SDM LMs via supervised fine-tuning using a final-layer SDM activation layer, contrastive input encoding, and online hard negative generation.

Result: SDM LMs achieve reduced abstentions compared to strong supervised baselines, indicating improved statistical efficiency.

Conclusion: The SDM approach successfully enhances language model performance by better calibrating probability regions and reducing abstention rates through contrastive training techniques.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

TL;DR: RCScore is a framework that evaluates how instruction style variations affect LLM performance, revealing accuracy shifts up to 16.7% and introducing cross-response similarity as a reliability proxy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations use single instruction templates, ignoring models' sensitivity to instruction style, which is crucial for real-world deployment reliability.

Method: Systematically transform benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles and introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) to measure stylistic self-consistency across different instruction formulations.

Result: Experiments across 10 LLMs on 4 reasoning benchmarks show instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7%. CRS strongly correlates with task accuracy, deterministic decoding produces more stable outputs, and model scale correlates with cross-style consistency.

Conclusion: RCScore provides a principled approach to assess instruction robustness, with consistency serving as a valuable proxy for model reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

TL;DR: Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) addresses update forgetting in diffusion language models by implementing semantic token ordering through per-token timestep schedules, improving controllability and fluency without requiring model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models suffer from update forgetting, where uniform updates cause token-level fluctuations that erase earlier semantic edits and disrupt refinement, degrading fluency and coherence.

Method: Proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) with per-token timestep schedules that freeze critical tokens early while continuing to refine uncertain tokens, implemented as fixed or adaptive policies operating purely at inference time.

Result: Significant improvements: 20% higher accuracy and nearly halved perplexity in sentiment control using <20% steps; lower maximum toxicity (12.2 vs 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 vs 32.0) in detoxification.

Conclusion: Softened ordering via timestep allocation is critical for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable, controllable diffusion text generation across various DLMs and supervision sources.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

### [96] [Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Benchmark for Corpus-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26205)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalQA, the first benchmark for evaluating global RAG capabilities that require aggregating information across entire document collections, and proposes GlobalRAG framework that significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG evaluation benchmarks focus only on local RAG (retrieving relevant chunks from small document subsets), but real-world applications often require global RAG capabilities to derive corpus-level insights by analyzing information across entire document collections.

Method: Proposed GlobalRAG framework with multi-tool collaboration: preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, uses LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation.

Result: Existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks (strongest baseline achieves only 1.51 F1). GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 on Qwen2.5-14B model, significantly outperforming the baseline.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG framework effectively addresses the limitations of current RAG methods for global tasks, demonstrating substantial performance improvements and validating the need for specialized approaches for corpus-level information aggregation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

### [97] [Pragmatic Theories Enhance Understanding of Implied Meanings in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26253)
*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using pragmatic theories (Gricean pragmatics, Relevance Theory) as prompts improves language models' ability to understand implied meanings, achieving up to 9.6% performance gains on pragmatic reasoning tasks compared to standard Chain-of-Thought prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models need to accurately interpret implied meanings for effective human communication, but current approaches may not fully leverage established pragmatic theories.

Method: Proposed approach presents pragmatic theories as prompts to guide language models through step-by-step reasoning processes for interpreting implied meanings, comparing against baseline 0-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Result: Methods achieved up to 9.6% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks compared to baseline. Even just mentioning pragmatic theory names in prompts yielded 1-3% improvements in larger models.

Conclusion: Providing pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach that significantly enhances language models' ability to understand implied meanings, with even minimal mentions of theory names providing measurable benefits.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether pretrained language models can identify loanwords in minority languages, finding they perform poorly and exhibit bias toward loanwords over native equivalents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine if language models can differentiate loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in bilingual communities where dominant languages impose lexical items on minority languages.

Method: Evaluated multiple pretrained language models (including large language models) across 10 languages using explicit instructions and contextual information for loanword identification.

Result: Models performed poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones, showing bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in NLP systems for minority language support and have implications for developing tools that aid language preservation in communities facing lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an empirical study of knowledge distillation (KD) approaches for multilingual vision-language models (VLMs), examining how different distillation methods affect cross-lingual representation consistency and performance stability when reducing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show uneven performance across languages, which worsens when model size is reduced. While knowledge distillation can transfer knowledge from larger to smaller models, its application in multilingual contexts is underexplored.

Method: The study evaluates five distillation approaches across CLIP and SigLIP2 models, testing them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual QA tasks to analyze effects on cross-lingual representation consistency.

Result: Some distillation configurations preserve or even improve multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, while others fail to maintain cross-task stability, revealing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate accuracy alone doesn't capture.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation approaches for multilingual VLMs show varying effectiveness, with some methods successfully maintaining performance across languages and tasks despite model compression, while others expose critical trade-offs in cross-task stability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

### [100] [Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26277)
*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD) is an unsupervised ensemble method that uses internal neuron activations instead of external signals to select the best reasoning candidates, enabling early correctness prediction and 99% token reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sample-evaluate-ensemble methods rely on poorly calibrated external signals like token probabilities and self-evaluations after post-training. Internal neuron activations provide richer, more reliable signals for candidate selection.

Method: NAD analyzes internal neuron activations, leveraging two key observations: correct responses activate fewer unique neurons and show stronger cross-sample agreement. It selects candidates based on activation sparsity and neuron agreement without requiring comparable textual outputs.

Result: NAD matches majority voting on math/science benchmarks and outperforms Avg@64 on open-ended coding tasks. It enables early correctness prediction within 32 tokens and reduces token usage by 99% with minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: Internal neuron activation signals provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label-free ensemble decoding, enabling substantial computational savings while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

TL;DR: LLMs develop accurate and interchangeable number representations despite producing numerical errors, enabling universal probes to trace error causes to specific layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between LLMs' accurate number representations and their tendency to produce numerical errors in outputs.

Method: Exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantifying accuracy bounds, creating universal probes for each LLM to trace information through layers.

Result: LLMs learn systematic, highly accurate, and universal number representations across hidden states and input contexts, allowing error tracing to specific layers.

Conclusion: Provides fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs handle numbers and outlines potential for more accurate probing techniques to refine LLM architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore ChatGPT Atlas's performance in dynamic, interactive web environments, as its capabilities in information retrieval have been demonstrated but real-time interaction remains less explored.

Method: Conducted evaluation using browser-based games (T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, Stein.world) as test scenarios, employing in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics across different task types.

Result: Atlas performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles.

Conclusion: While Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in deploying language models for educational feedback: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and need for pedagogically valid responses that can run locally.

Method: SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with self-reflective inference pipeline for iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. Models are distilled into 3B and 8B versions via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data.

Result: 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to larger models in relevance and actionability, and are perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students in user study with 108 participants.

Conclusion: SCRIBE demonstrates viability for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications by enabling small models to generate valid responses to student questions about feedback reports.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER is a method that transforms general LLMs into domain experts by creating synthetic textbook-style curricula and using continual pretraining, achieving significant improvements in specialized domains while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in specialized domains requiring deep understanding, creating a need to bridge this domain gap without sacrificing general capabilities.

Method: ACER synthesizes comprehensive curricula by generating tables of contents and Bloom's taxonomy-guided QA pairs, then uses continual pretraining with interleaved curriculum scheduling.

Result: ACER boosts accuracy by 5 points in microeconomics, achieves 3-point macro-average improvement across target domains, enables positive cross-domain transfer (+0.7 points), and improves ARC/GPQA benchmarks by over 2 points while maintaining general reasoning.

Conclusion: ACER provides a scalable and effective approach for closing critical domain gaps in LLMs while preserving their broad capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is prevalent and harmful, but difficult to identify especially when claims distort scientific findings. Limited annotated resources make detection challenging.

Method: Proposed MisSynth pipeline applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, then uses them to fine-tune LLM models like LLaMA 3.1 8B.

Result: Fine-tuned models show substantial accuracy gains - LLaMA 3.1 8B achieved over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on MISSCI test split compared to vanilla baseline.

Conclusion: Synthetic fallacy data augmentation significantly enhances zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

TL;DR: Proposes an interaction-centric framework for automatic LLM team composition using semantic coherence from pairwise conversations to form synergistic groups without requiring prior knowledge about models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM approaches show promise but require optimal team composition, which is challenging due to model opacity that obscures internal characteristics needed for effective collaboration.

Method: Constructs a 'language model graph' mapping relationships from pairwise conversation coherence, then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters without needing model architectures, training data, or task performance knowledge.

Result: Method discovers functionally coherent groups reflecting latent specializations; synergistic teams outperform random baselines and achieve comparable accuracy to manually-curated teams on downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a new basis for automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams through interaction-centric composition.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: With increasing use of generative AI in science workflows, the authors want to use discourse-level information to find supporting evidence for AI-generated scientific claims, with discourse structure inference being a first step.

Method: The study uses pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for discourse relation classification, focusing on scientific publications and examining how context defined by discourse structure helps the task.

Result: Experiments show that context, as defined by discourse structure, is generally helpful for discourse relation classification. The analysis also identifies which scientific discourse relation types benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Context from discourse structure improves discourse relation classification in scientific writing, with certain relation types showing greater benefits, providing insights for using discourse-level information to support AI-generated scientific claims.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to

TL;DR: OmniEduBench is a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark with 24.6K question-answer pairs covering knowledge and cultivation dimensions across 61 subjects, revealing significant performance gaps in LLMs compared to human intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge evaluation and lack diversity, particularly in Chinese educational contexts, while neglecting cultivation capabilities essential for real-world education.

Method: Developed OmniEduBench with 24.6K high-quality QA pairs divided into knowledge (18.1K) and cultivation (6.5K) dimensions, each with 6 categories covering 61 subjects and 11 question formats.

Result: Extensive testing on 11 LLMs showed only Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 60% accuracy in knowledge dimension, while best model (QWQ) trailed human intelligence by nearly 30% in cultivation dimension.

Conclusion: LLMs have substantial room for improvement in educational applications, with cultivation capabilities being particularly challenging, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

TL;DR: SSLC is a synergistic compression method that combines sparse optimization and low-rank approximation to efficiently compress LLMs without performance loss, achieving 50% compression and 1.63× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment constraints due to high bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning and low-rank approximation work well individually, their combined potential for LLM compression remains unexplored.

Method: Formulates low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem solved through iterative optimization, leveraging low-rank for structure preservation and sparsity for weight elimination.

Result: SSLC consistently outperforms standalone methods on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B), achieving 50% compression on Qwen2.5 with no performance drop and at least 1.63× speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC provides a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment by synergistically combining sparse and low-rank compression techniques without requiring additional training steps.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

### [110] [Bayesian Network Fusion of Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26484)
*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes BNLF framework that integrates multiple LLMs using Bayesian networks for sentiment analysis, achieving ~6% accuracy improvement over baseline models while addressing transparency, cost, and environmental concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges with domain-specific LLMs including lack of transparency, high fine-tuning costs, extensive prompt engineering, inconsistent results across domains, and significant environmental impact from computational demands.

Method: BNLF framework integrates predictions from FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet through probabilistic late fusion using Bayesian networks, modeling sentiment predictions as probabilistic nodes.

Result: Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora, BNLF demonstrated consistent gains of about 6% in accuracy over baseline LLMs, showing robustness to dataset variability.

Conclusion: Probabilistic fusion through Bayesian networks provides an effective approach for interpretable sentiment classification, offering improved performance while addressing key limitations of individual LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An ensemble of multiple LLM agents provides more reliable assessment of AI triage tools than single LLMs, with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o showing best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could provide more reliable assessment of pixel-based AI triage tools compared to single LLMs.

Method: Analyzed 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams using a commercial ICH AI detection tool, with radiology reports processed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLMs and GPT-4o using multi-shot prompts. 1,726 examples were manually reviewed.

Result: Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o achieved highest AUC (0.78) and average precision (0.75-0.76). Llama3.3:70b had highest F1 score (0.81), recall (0.85), precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Ensemble methods outperformed single LLM approaches.

Conclusion: Ensemble of medium to large open-source LLMs provides more consistent and reliable ground truth evaluation for clinical AI triage tools than single LLMs alone.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

### [112] [Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512)
*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an ablation study of the CORE-KG framework, which addresses challenges in knowledge graph construction from legal case documents by integrating coreference resolution and structured prompts to reduce node duplication and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are adaptive and difficult to analyze using legal case documents, which are unstructured, lexically dense, and contain ambiguous references that challenge automated knowledge graph construction. Existing LLM-based approaches generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes.

Method: The study conducts a systematic ablation analysis of the CORE-KG framework, which integrates a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts. The research quantifies the individual contributions of these two key components by removing each one and measuring the impact.

Result: Removing coreference resolution resulted in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and 4.32% increase in noisy nodes. Removing structured prompts led to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

Conclusion: The findings provide empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex legal texts, demonstrating the critical importance of both coreference resolution and structured prompts in reducing noise and duplication in knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVRIT is a novel Hebrew diacritization system that frames the task as zero-shot classification using a Hebrew Visual Language Model to process undiacritized text as images, achieving high accuracy in oracle settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hebrew diacritics restoration is crucial for accurate pronunciation and meaning disambiguation, but the language has high ambiguity when unvocalized. Recent ML approaches have advanced performance, but there's need for more effective methods.

Method: Frames diacritization as zero-shot classification at word level, selecting appropriate diacritization patterns from dynamically generated candidate sets conditioned on context. Uses Hebrew Visual Language Model that processes undiacritized text as images to embed diacritic information directly in vector representations.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in oracle settings where correct diacritized form is guaranteed among candidates. Architectural enhancements and optimized training yield significant improvements in generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Visual representations show promising potential for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization, effectively performing the task without complex explicit linguistic analysis.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [114] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes linear operators in transformer language models that decode relational facts, showing they can be compressed via tensor networks due to redundancy. The operators extract coarse-grained semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining their compressibility and limited generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous single-relation findings about linear decoders in transformers to multiple relations, systematically chart their organization, and explain the surprising redundancy and compressibility observed in these operators.

Method: Extend single-relation findings to collections of relations, use tensor networks for compression analysis, and develop a cross-evaluation protocol where each linear decoder is applied to subjects of other relations to reveal semantic structure.

Result: Linear relation decoders can be highly compressed by order-3 tensor networks without significant accuracy loss. Cross-evaluation reveals they extract recurring coarse-grained semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining both compressibility and limited generalization to semantically close relations.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding in transformer language models is primarily property-based rather than relation-specific, with operators extracting recurring semantic properties that explain their compressibility and generalization patterns.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoFlow addresses low reward density in RLVR by decomposing tasks, providing failure-guided hints, and using dual-agent architecture to improve reward per exploration cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR suffers from low reward density in deep search scenarios where agents incur high exploratory costs for infrequent rewards, limiting practical application.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Subproblem decomposition for process rewards, 2) Failure-guided hints for corrective guidance, 3) Dual-agent architecture with refiner agent to compress search history.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines on agentic search benchmarks, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: InfoFlow effectively addresses the reward density optimization problem through systematic decomposition, guidance, and architectural improvements, making RLVR more practical for deep search applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: CAST is a new dynamic tree decoding approach that optimizes speculative decoding by considering GPU configurations and batch sizes, achieving up to 5.2x speedup over conventional methods and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face significant inference latency due to autoregressive design and large size. Existing speculative decoding approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.

Method: Introduces CAST, a dynamic tree decoding approach that considers inference costs including GPU configurations and batch sizes to dynamically refine the tree structure for speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods and generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20% across six diverse tasks using six distinct LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively addresses LLM inference latency by incorporating system-level optimization factors into dynamic tree speculative decoding, demonstrating significant performance improvements over both conventional and state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent is an agentic framework that improves multi-page visual document understanding by decomposing reasoning into global, page, and element levels, achieving significant performance gains over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems struggle with complex multi-page visual documents that require fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages, particularly for documents like slide decks that rely on layout, colors, icons, and cross-references.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three levels (global, page, element) to create a structured, query-agnostic representation. During inference, it selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary models (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Conclusion: SlideAgent provides an effective framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents through specialized multi-level reasoning, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) and compares them with decoder-only LLMs (DecLLM) across different model scales, finding that RedLLM has compelling scaling properties, strong performance, and better inference efficiency after instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid transition to decoder-only LLMs occurred without rigorous comparative analysis from a scaling perspective, raising concerns that encoder-decoder models' potential may have been overlooked.

Method: Enhanced encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM) with recent recipes from decoder-only LLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling, and compared with DecLLM pretrained with causal LM across scales from ~150M to ~8B parameters using RedPajama V1 for pretraining and FLAN for instruction tuning.

Result: RedLLM shows compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM achieves comparable or better results on downstream tasks with substantially better inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Encoder-decoder LLMs deserve re-examination as they show strong potential for developing powerful and efficient LLMs, with better inference efficiency after instruction tuning compared to decoder-only models.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evontree is a framework that uses ontology rules to extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge in LLMs without needing large external datasets, achieving up to 3.7% accuracy improvement in medical QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in data-sensitive domains like healthcare due to lack of high-quality domain-specific training data, while domain experts have created valuable ontology rules that formalize domain knowledge relationships.

Method: Extracts domain ontology from raw LLMs, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces refined knowledge through self-distilled fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 show consistent outperformance over unmodified models and supervised baselines, with up to 3.7% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, efficient, and robust for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs, demonstrating the value of leveraging existing ontology rules to enhance domain knowledge in language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention across various scenarios while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6x decoding throughput for long contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a linear attention architecture that can outperform full attention while maintaining efficiency, particularly for long-context scenarios where traditional attention mechanisms face computational challenges.

Method: Uses Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) with finer-grained gating mechanism and bespoke chunkwise algorithm with specialized DPLR transition matrices. Implements a 3B parameter model with hybrid KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA).

Result: Outperforms full MLA across all evaluated tasks with identical training recipe, reduces KV cache usage by up to 75%, achieves up to 6x decoding throughput for 1M context length.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear serves as a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, particularly beneficial for tasks with longer input and output lengths.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco enables truly end-to-end LLM generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy through lightweight heads that dynamically predict temperature and top-p values alongside next-token logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs depend on non-differentiable decoding processes requiring manual hyperparameter tuning, which breaks the 'end-to-end' promise and limits adaptability.

Method: Augment standard transformer with lightweight heads that dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values at each step, transforming decoding into a parametric, token-level process within a single forward pass.

Result: AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves performance comparable to oracle-tuned baselines across eight benchmarks. It also demonstrates emergent instruction-based decoding control.

Conclusion: AutoDeco opens a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding by enabling models to self-regulate sampling strategies and respond to natural language commands about decoding behavior.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates when and how value alignment emerges during LLM post-training, finding that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily establishes model values while preference optimization rarely re-aligns them, with different algorithms leading to different alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more influential in society, understanding how they learn to align with human values during training is crucial. Previous work focused on evaluating final models but overlooked the training dynamics of value acquisition.

Method: Analyzed value alignment dynamics during post-training of Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models using SFT and preference optimization datasets/algorithms. Used synthetic preference datasets for controlled value manipulation experiments.

Result: SFT phase primarily establishes model values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values. Different preference optimization algorithms produce different value alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for data curation and algorithm selection to improve model alignment with human values, emphasizing that value alignment is primarily established during SFT rather than preference optimization phases.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a new mathematical reasoning benchmark with 50 original, Olympiad-level problems designed to challenge top LLMs, where even the best model achieves only 52.4% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math competition benchmarks are becoming ineffective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation, requiring more rigorous challenges at IMO-level difficulty.

Method: Created 50 human-crafted problems cross-validated by experts to meet IMO standards, all original to prevent data memorization, with final-answer-only format for automatic grading.

Result: Across 26 LLMs, best model achieved only 52.4% accuracy, with most below 40%, but showed promising scaling trend with increased test-time compute.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench reveals significant room for improving mathematical reasoning in current LLMs and provides a challenging benchmark for advancing reasoning abilities.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

*Hyunji Lee,Minseon Kim,Chinmay Singh,Matheus Pereira,Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Zhengyan Shi,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan,Lucas Caccia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gistify is a task where coding LLMs must create minimal, self-contained files that reproduce specific codebase functionalities, requiring structural understanding and execution flow modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, there is a need for automated, challenging codebase-level evaluation tasks.

Method: Gistify gives coding LLMs full access to a codebase and a specific entrypoint, requiring them to generate minimal files that replicate the output of the same command run under the full codebase.

Result: Current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially those with long execution traces.

Conclusion: Gistify presents a challenging evaluation task that requires advanced codebase understanding and execution modeling capabilities that current models lack.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

### [125] [Towards Piece-by-Piece Explanations for Chess Positions with SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25775)
*Francesco Spinnato*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper adapts SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to chess analysis to attribute engine evaluations to specific pieces, making opaque centipawn scores interpretable by showing individual piece contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chess engines provide precise but opaque evaluations as centipawn scores, which obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns, making it difficult to understand why certain positions are evaluated as they are.

Method: The authors adapt SHAP to chess by treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them to compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the engine's output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner.

Result: The method successfully attributes chess engine evaluations to specific pieces, providing interpretable explanations that align with classical chess pedagogy where players assess positions by mentally removing pieces.

Conclusion: This approach enables new possibilities for visualization, human training, and engine comparison in chess AI, with released code and data to foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework that infers thinking traces from label-only annotations using rejection sampling, then applies these traces to fine-tune open LLM raters and synthesize clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters, significantly improving LLM-human agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as evaluation raters but their reliability is limited for subjective tasks where human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond simple labels. Thinking traces (the reasoning behind judgments) are informative but challenging to collect.

Method: Proposes a human-LLM collaborative framework using rejection sampling to reconstruct thinking traces from label-only annotations at scale. These inferred traces are then used to fine-tune open LLM raters and synthesize clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters.

Result: Across multiple datasets, the methods lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. The refined annotation guidelines also increase agreement among different LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM raters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a two-level framework (ITI and CEP) explaining why compression leads to causal structure discovery in intelligence, linking survival pressure to information-processing demands and showing how efficient compression selects for generative causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address why compression processes in intelligence enforce discovery of causal structure rather than superficial statistical patterns, which existing frameworks leave underspecified.

Method: Introduces a two-level framework: Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) establishes evolutionary pressure for predictive compression, and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression selects for generative causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics.

Result: The framework yields testable predictions including correlation between compression efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization, differentiation of causal from correlational models via exception-accumulation rates, and hierarchical efficiency across abstraction layers.

Conclusion: ITI and CEP provide a unified account of intelligence convergence across biological and artificial systems, showing intelligence is mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments without invoking consciousness assumptions.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for modeling diverse persona-based preferences by aggregating multiple rubric-conditioned judges to address LLM judge calibration issues like bias and instability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is challenging due to calibration difficulties, rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. This is crucial for applications like RLHF reward models and model routing systems.

Method: Proposes a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and implements two aggregators: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges.

Result: The approach is evaluated against naive baselines and its robustness is assessed through case studies on human and LLM-judge biases.

Conclusion: The framework provides a solution for modeling diverse preferences and improving LLM judge reliability through persona-based aggregation methods.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0 is a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Evaluation of seven LLMs showed general-purpose industry models outperformed science-specialized models, with GPT-4-mini demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have transformative potential in scientific research but raise significant trustworthiness concerns in high-stakes contexts, necessitating comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

Method: The framework incorporates novel open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through verified reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, plus a novel ethics benchmark covering eight subcategories including dual-use research and bias. Seven LLMs were evaluated using multiple metrics including accuracy, semantic similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring.

Result: General-purpose industry models overall outperformed science-specialized models across all trustworthiness dimensions. GPT-4-mini showed superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning, with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in high-risk domains like biosecurity and chemical weapons.

Conclusion: By open-sourcing the framework, the authors provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in

TL;DR: The paper proposes using autonomous AI agents to automate FinOps processes, addressing challenges with heterogeneous cloud billing data by creating a system that retrieves, consolidates, and analyzes data to generate optimization recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FinOps practitioners face fundamental challenges with heterogeneous billing data formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers and internal systems, making it difficult to synthesize actionable insights and make time-sensitive decisions.

Method: Built a FinOps agent for IT infrastructure and cost optimization use-case, simulating a realistic end-to-end industry process from data retrieval from various sources to data consolidation, analysis, and recommendation generation.

Result: The agent was evaluated using open-source and closed-source language models with defined metrics, showing it could understand, plan, and execute tasks as effectively as an actual FinOps practitioner.

Conclusion: Autonomous, goal-driven AI agents can successfully automate FinOps processes and perform at human practitioner levels for cloud cost optimization tasks.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 3.8B parameter model called Humans-Junior achieves GPT-4o-level performance on FACTS Grounding benchmark within ±5 pp equivalence margin, while being approximately 19x cheaper than GPT-4o on cloud pricing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-efficient small language model that can match the performance of much larger frontier models on factual grounding tasks, enabling more accessible and affordable AI deployment.

Method: Combines minimal directed 'Exoskeleton Reasoning' scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance rather than domain answers. The approach synergizes reasoning scaffolds with fine-tuning to achieve significant performance improvements.

Result: Humans-Junior scores 72.7% vs GPT-4o's 73.5% on Q1-Q500, with paired difference of 0.8 pp (statistically equivalent within ±5 pp margin). The combined method provides +17.7 pp improvement with reduced variance. Cloud pricing shows 19x cost reduction compared to GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Small language models can achieve frontier model performance on factual grounding tasks through targeted reasoning scaffolds and behavioral fine-tuning, offering substantial cost advantages for both cloud and self-hosted deployments.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces attention-aware inverse planning to estimate people's cognitive biases from their actions, combining deep reinforcement learning with cognitive modeling to infer attentional strategies in real-world driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous systems need to understand human cognitive biases that influence goal-directed behaviors, particularly in tasks like driving where attention biases systematically affect performance.

Method: Developed attention-aware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling to infer attentional biases from observed behavior.

Result: Successfully demonstrated the approach by inferring attentional strategies of RL agents in real-life driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset, showing scalability of cognitive bias estimation.

Conclusion: Attention-aware inverse planning provides a systematic framework for estimating cognitive biases from behavior, offering a scalable approach that differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic pipeline using Mistral-based ReAct agent significantly improves NL-to-SQL performance for spatio-temporal queries, achieving 91.4% accuracy vs 28.6% baseline, with enhanced usability through visualizations and natural language summaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL-to-SQL systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries that require schema alignment, temporal reasoning, and appropriate output selection, limiting accessibility for non-expert users.

Method: Extended naive text-to-SQL baseline (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by Mistral-based ReAct agent that plans, decomposes, and adapts queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools.

Result: Achieved 91.4% accuracy on 35 natural-language queries over NYC and Tokyo check-in datasets, substantially outperforming the 28.6% baseline accuracy, with enhanced usability through maps, plots, and structured summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration, rather than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial assistants that enable natural human-database interaction for users without SQL expertise.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

### [136] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StuckSolver is an LLM-driven recovery framework that helps autonomous vehicles resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and passenger-guided decision-making, operating as a plug-in module without modifying existing AV architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous vehicles face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel, often becoming immobilized and disrupting traffic flow. Existing recovery solutions like remote intervention and manual takeover are inadequate due to cost, inefficiency, and accessibility limitations.

Method: StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands for the AV's native planner. It uses LLM-driven reasoning for autonomous decision-making and can incorporate passenger guidance.

Result: Evaluation on Bench2Drive benchmark and custom uncertainty scenarios shows StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone, with further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.

Conclusion: StuckSolver provides an effective solution for AV immobilization recovery that enhances autonomous capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing AV systems, offering both autonomous and human-assisted recovery options.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [137] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for AI accountability, defining it as the ability for forums to request information, discuss actions, and sanction AI systems, and explores approaches to make AI more accountable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes increasingly powerful, it's crucial that it serves the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers through proper accountability mechanisms.

Method: The paper relates general accountability definitions to AI, illustrates what accountable vs unaccountable AI looks like, and explores various approaches to improve AI accountability.

Result: The analysis shows that current AI systems often lack accountability - they cannot be questioned, discussed with, or sanctioned, which is problematic for their responsible deployment.

Conclusion: Developing approaches to ensure all AI systems are accountable to those affected by them is essential for creating a world where powerful AI serves human needs responsibly.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS is a formal reasoning framework for college-level physics problems in Lean4, featuring LeanPhysBench (200 physics problems) and PhysLib (foundational theorems). Current AI models perform poorly (16-35% success), but PhysLib improves performance by 11.75%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the first physics benchmark in Lean4 for formal reasoning, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation for physics problem-solving in theorem proving environments.

Method: Created LeanPhysBench with 200 hand-crafted physics problems from textbooks and competitions, developed PhysLib as a foundational repository of unit systems and theorems, and evaluated major Lean4 provers and AI models.

Result: Best performance: DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B (16%) and Claude-Sonnet-4 (35%). PhysLib improved model performance by average 11.75%, demonstrating benchmark's difficulty and library's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS provides a challenging benchmark for formal physics reasoning, showing current AI models struggle with physics problems in Lean4, but foundational libraries like PhysLib can significantly improve performance.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper identifies three key dimensions of GUI knowledge that current vision language models lack, introduces a benchmark called GUI Knowledge Bench to evaluate this knowledge across multiple platforms, and shows that improving GUI knowledge directly correlates with better task automation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision language models (VLMs) lag behind humans in GUI task automation, which the authors hypothesize stems from missing core GUI knowledge that existing training methods cannot fully address.

Method: The authors analyzed common failure patterns in GUI task execution and distilled GUI knowledge into three dimensions: interface perception, interaction prediction, and instruction understanding. They created GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms and 292 applications.

Result: Evaluation shows current VLMs can identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real-world GUI tasks validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success.

Conclusion: The structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge supports selecting VLMs with greater potential before downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an economic framework for analyzing LLM inference costs, treating it as compute-driven production and identifying principles like diminishing marginal cost and optimal cost-effectiveness zones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high inference costs of Large Language Models are limiting their commercial viability and widespread adoption, creating a need for economic analysis of inference processes.

Method: Developed a quantitative 'economics of inference' framework treating LLM inference as compute-driven production, analyzed marginal cost, economies of scale, and output quality using empirical data from WiNEval-3.0.

Result: Constructed the first 'LLM Inference Production Frontier' revealing three principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone.

Conclusion: The framework provides economic basis for model deployment decisions and lays empirical foundation for market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

TL;DR: Reasoning Curriculum is a two-stage RL approach that first develops reasoning skills in math domains using verifiable rewards, then transfers these skills to other domains through joint RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most current RL efforts for LLMs focus primarily on math and code, leaving other domains underdeveloped. The authors aim to create a general reasoning capability that can transfer across multiple domains.

Method: Two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 performs math-only RL with verifiable rewards for skill development. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate reasoning skills across domains.

Result: The method shows consistent gains on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B models across a multi-domain evaluation suite. Both stages are necessary, and math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for complex problem-solving.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for developing general reasoning capabilities in LLMs through a minimal, backbone-agnostic approach that doesn't require specialized reward models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

TL;DR: ToolRM is a family of lightweight generative reward models designed for tool-use scenarios, trained on a novel pairwise preference dataset and achieving superior performance in tool-calling tasks compared to frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized reward models for function-calling tasks in tool learning has limited progress in developing more capable agentic AI systems.

Method: Proposed a novel pipeline using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling to construct ToolPref-Pairwise-30K dataset, then trained lightweight generative RMs on this data for tool-use scenarios.

Result: Models from Qwen3-4B/8B series achieved up to 14.28% higher accuracy in pairwise reward judgments, outperforming Claude 4 and OpenAI o3. ToolRM also reduced output token usage by over 66% in ACEBench experiments.

Conclusion: ToolRM effectively addresses the gap in tool-use reward modeling, enabling better alignment of LLMs with human preferences in function-calling tasks and supporting various critique applications like Best-of-N sampling and self-correction.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: QASU is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on questionnaire analysis tasks, showing that proper serialization formats and prompting strategies can significantly improve performance on tasks like answer lookup and multi-hop inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current survey analysis tools are human-centric and don't integrate well with LLMs, leaving a gap in evidence-based guidance for representing questionnaires for AI consumption despite the massive scale of survey data collected daily.

Method: Developed QASU benchmark with six structural skills tested across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies, using self-augmented prompting for structural hints.

Result: Choosing effective format and prompt combinations improved accuracy by up to 8.8% points, with structural hints providing additional 3-4% point improvements on specific tasks.

Conclusion: QASU provides a versatile foundation for advancing LLM-based questionnaire analysis by systematically isolating format and prompting effects, enabling better integration of survey data with AI systems.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC is a distributed LLM-based traffic signal control system that uses RAG enhancement and emergency response mechanisms to improve reliability and generalization across diverse intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in traffic signal control, including hallucinations during emergencies and poor generalization across different intersection types.

Method: Emergency-aware reasoning framework with dynamic reasoning depth and Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG), plus type-agnostic traffic representation and Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for cross-intersection training.

Result: On real-world road networks with 17-177 intersections, REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: REG-TSC effectively addresses LLM limitations in traffic signal control through RAG enhancement and emergency response mechanisms, achieving superior performance and generalization across heterogeneous intersections.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: GEPO addresses structural blindness in group-based RL for LLM agents by dynamically building state-transition graphs and using graph centrality for better exploration, credit assignment, and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group-based RL methods for multi-turn LLM agents suffer from structural blindness - inability to exploit environmental connectivity, leading to inefficient exploration, imprecise credit assignment, and myopic planning.

Method: Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO) dynamically constructs state-transition graphs from agent experience and uses graph-theoretic centrality to provide: structured intrinsic rewards for exploration, graph-enhanced advantage function for credit assignment, and dynamic discount factors adapted to state strategic value.

Result: On ALFWorld, WebShop, and proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO achieved absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust, generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance is a framework that aligns structured regulatory text representations (Policy Graph) with runtime context representations (Context Graph) to improve compliance assessment, achieving 4.1-7.2 pp higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines on GDPR scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web-scale compliance requires regulatory assessment for each request, but regulatory texts are cross-referential and normative while runtime contexts are unstructured natural language, creating challenges for automated compliance checking.

Method: Represent regulatory texts as Policy Graph (encoding normative structure and cross-references) and runtime contexts as Context Graph (formalizing events as subject-action-object and entity-relation triples), then align them to anchor LLM reasoning in structured information.

Result: On 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios across five tasks, GraphCompliance achieved 4.1-7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates.

Conclusion: Structured representations and judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning, with ablation studies showing contributions from each graph component in reducing regulatory interpretation and event parsing burden.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT), a new state abstraction technique for Monte Carlo Tree Search that uses weaker abstraction conditions to find more abstractions, trading minor accuracy loss for improved performance across various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-action pair abstractions work well in MCTS, but state abstractions are rarely found in noisy or large action space settings due to overly constraining conditions, limiting sample efficiency improvements.

Method: Proposes IPA-UCT using Ideal Pruning Abstractions framework with weaker state abstraction conditions, and introduces p-ASAP as a generalization that encompasses both IPA and existing ASAP frameworks.

Result: IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT and its derivatives across a wide range of test domains and iteration budgets, demonstrating better performance despite using weaker abstraction conditions.

Conclusion: The weaker state abstraction conditions in IPA-UCT enable finding many more abstractions with only minor accuracy loss, providing a practical solution to the state abstraction problem in MCTS for noisy and large action space settings.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS is a Bayesian online task selection framework for reinforcement finetuning of LLMs that adaptively maintains task difficulty estimates and balances exploration-exploitation using Thompson sampling, improving data efficiency without extra rollout costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RFT methods are inefficient due to uniform task sampling (wasting computation on trivial/unsolvable tasks) and existing task selection approaches suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence.

Method: BOTS uses Bayesian inference to maintain posterior estimates of task difficulty, incorporates both explicit evidence from evaluated tasks and implicit evidence for unevaluated tasks via ultra-light interpolation, and employs Thompson sampling for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: Across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing practical dynamic task selection without extra rollout overhead.

Conclusion: BOTS offers a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in reinforcement finetuning, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods through its Bayesian framework and implicit evidence incorporation.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

### [150] [AI Mathematician as a Partner in Advancing Mathematical Discovery - A Case Study in Homogenization Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26380)
*Yuanhang Liu,Beichen Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores AI-human collaboration in mathematical research, showing how the AI Mathematician system can work as a research partner on complex homogenization problems through structured reasoning and human guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While AI has advanced in mathematical reasoning, its integration into actual mathematical research remains limited. The study aims to demonstrate how AI can function as a collaborative research partner rather than just a problem solver.

Method: The approach combines autonomous AI reasoning with targeted human interventions, using iterative problem decomposition into tractable subgoals, selection of analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results through human-AI co-reasoning.

Result: The collaborative paradigm produced a complete and verifiable proof for a challenging homogenization theory problem, enhancing proof reliability, transparency, and interpretability while maintaining human oversight for formal rigor.

Conclusion: Systematic human-AI co-reasoning represents a viable approach to advance mathematical discovery, demonstrating how human intuition and machine computation can effectively complement each other in research contexts.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scales++ is a novel item-centric approach for creating efficient LLM benchmarks by selecting data based on cognitive demands rather than model performance, reducing selection costs by 18x while maintaining predictive fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric benchmark selection methods have high upfront costs, cold-start problems with new benchmarks, and assume future models will share failure patterns of existing ones.

Method: Proposes an item-centric approach where data selection is based on intrinsic properties and cognitive demands of task items rather than model-specific failure patterns.

Result: Reduces upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity; predicts full benchmark scores with 2.9% mean absolute error using just 0.5% data subset on Open LLM Leaderboard.

Conclusion: Item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, provides better cold-start performance, and offers more interpretable benchmarking.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [152] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating personhood as a flexible bundle of obligations that societies confer to solve governance problems, rather than as a metaphysical property. This approach allows creating practical tools for AI integration without resolving debates about AI consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergence of agentic AI and the resulting diversification of personhood types, providing a practical framework for integrating AI agents into society without getting stuck in philosophical debates about consciousness.

Method: Proposes a pragmatic framework that unbundles traditional personhood into flexible obligations (rights and responsibilities) that can be tailored to different contexts. Uses decentralized digital identity technology and examines both 'personhood as a problem' (exploitative design) and 'personhood as a solution' (accountability mechanisms).

Result: The framework enables creation of practical governance tools, such as facilitating AI contracting by creating sanctionable 'individuals', and provides a way to integrate AI agents into social roles while ensuring accountability.

Conclusion: By rejecting essentialist definitions of personhood and adopting a flexible, pragmatic approach focused on obligations and governance needs, societies can better navigate the integration of diverse AI agents without resolving intractable debates about consciousness or rationality.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ transforms traditional autograders into formative learning tools by using fine-tuned LLMs for automated feedback and visualization of student code patterns, reducing instructor workload while improving learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autograders provide limited feedback as black-box systems, failing to offer insights into student thinking or learning needs despite the rapid growth of programming education.

Method: Uses fine-tuned Large Language Model on curated student code and expert feedback for automated feedback generation, plus contrastively learned code embeddings for visualizing student submissions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach.

Result: Evaluation on 600 student submissions showed strong semantic alignment with instructor comments. Code embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions effectively grouped solutions into meaningful clusters. System supports prompt-pooling for customizable feedback styles.

Conclusion: Autograder+ successfully integrates AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive visualization to reduce instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable step toward clinically reliable representations, successfully bridging high-performing medical AI with transparency requirements.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.

### [155] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought Hijacking is a jailbreak attack that pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning to bypass safety safeguards in large reasoning models, achieving high attack success rates across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that contrary to prior beliefs that scaled reasoning strengthens safety, the same reasoning mechanisms can be exploited to bypass safeguards in large reasoning models.

Method: The attack involves padding harmful requests with long sequences of benign puzzle reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) to dilute safety checking signals and shift attention away from harmful tokens.

Result: Achieved 99% ASR on Gemini 2.5 Pro, 94% on GPT o4 mini, 100% on Grok 3 mini, and 94% on Claude 4 Sonnet - significantly exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs.

Conclusion: Explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning, when combined with final-answer cues, can become an effective jailbreak vector by diluting safety checking mechanisms in large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o shows high susceptibility to social influence in hiring decisions, with 99.9% conformity when facing unanimous opposition and 40.2% conformity with single partners, demonstrating it adapts to social consensus rather than acting independently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models like GPT-4o are susceptible to social influence in high-stakes decision-making contexts, particularly hiring scenarios where conformity could have significant consequences.

Method: Three preregistered conformity experiments: baseline study establishing GPT's initial preferences, Study 1 with unanimous opposition from 8 simulated partners, and Study 2 with single partner interactions in a hiring context.

Result: GPT consistently favored Profile C in baseline, but showed 99.9% conformity with unanimous opposition and 40.2% conformity with single partners, reporting lower certainty and elevated normative and informational conformity.

Conclusion: GPT does not act as an independent observer but adapts to perceived social consensus, highlighting risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and the need to elicit AI judgments before exposing them to human opinions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG is a modular framework that uses LLM-guided coreference resolution to build cleaner knowledge graphs from legal case documents about human smuggling networks, reducing node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling networks are complex and evolving, making analysis difficult. Legal case documents provide rich insights but are long, unstructured, and contain ambiguous references, posing challenges for automated knowledge graph construction.

Method: LINK-KG integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction, using a type-specific Prompt Cache to track and resolve references across document chunks for clean narrative construction.

Result: LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, producing cleaner and more coherent graph structures.

Conclusion: LINK-KG establishes a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks through improved knowledge graph construction from legal texts.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic analysis of context engineering, tracing its evolution from early human-computer interaction frameworks to current human-agent paradigms, and proposes a conceptual foundation for future AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address how machines can better understand human situations and purposes by examining context engineering, which has evolved through different historical phases shaped by machine intelligence levels.

Method: The authors situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations through a historical analysis spanning from the early 1990s to present.

Result: The paper establishes that context engineering practices can be traced back more than twenty years, evolving through distinct phases from primitive human-computer interaction to current intelligent agent paradigms.

Conclusion: This work offers a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketches its promising future, serving as a stepping stone for broader community efforts toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-assisted human oversight improves fact-verification accuracy when combining AI and human ratings based on AI confidence. The type of AI assistance matters - showing search results and evidence works better than displaying explanations, confidence, and labels to avoid over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities grow and tackle more complex tasks, verifying quality and safety becomes increasingly difficult. This research explores using AI to enhance human oversight capabilities, particularly for challenging safety problems like fact-verification of AI outputs.

Method: The study examines different approaches to combining AI and human ratings for fact-verification, testing various types of AI assistance including explanations, confidence scores, labels, search results, and evidence displays.

Result: Combining AI ratings with human ratings based on AI confidence outperforms using either alone. AI assistance improves human accuracy, but the form matters - displaying search results and evidence fosters appropriate trust while explanations, confidence, and labels lead to over-reliance.

Conclusion: The findings support Amplified Oversight approaches where humans and AI collaborate to supervise AI systems, even as AI surpasses human expert performance. Careful design of AI assistance is crucial to maintain appropriate human trust and prevent over-reliance.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

TL;DR: An AI-powered Home Energy Management System that uses large language models as autonomous coordinators to translate natural language preferences into optimal multi-appliance scheduling, achieving cost savings comparable to mathematical optimization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome user interaction barriers in HEMS adoption by eliminating the need for technical parameter translation, leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding to enable everyday users to control energy systems through simple conversation.

Method: Hierarchical agentic architecture with one orchestrator and three specialist agents using ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, integrating Google Calendar for context awareness, and evaluating across multiple LLMs with real electricity price data.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinated all appliances across scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks from mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieved perfect single-appliance performance but struggled with multi-appliance coordination.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as autonomous coordinators for complex energy management tasks, though model capabilities vary significantly, and the system demonstrates the potential for natural language interfaces to democratize energy management while achieving professional-grade optimization.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates large language models' normative reasoning capabilities, comparing them with epistemic reasoning using a new dataset that includes both formal logical patterns and human cognitive factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning involving obligation and permission remains underexplored, creating a gap in understanding their logical consistency in this domain.

Method: The researchers created a comprehensive dataset covering formal reasoning patterns in normative and epistemic domains, incorporating cognitive factors that influence human reasoning, and systematically compared LLMs' performance across these domains.

Result: LLMs generally follow valid reasoning patterns but show notable inconsistencies in specific normative reasoning types and exhibit cognitive biases similar to those found in human reasoning studies.

Conclusion: The findings reveal challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for improving their reliability, with all data and code made publicly available.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: To realize the vision of agentic organization where agents solve complex problems collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence.

Method: Proposes a thinking protocol with an organizer that dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. The thinking structure can be further optimized through reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Generalizes learned asynchronous thinking capabilities to tackle unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink effectively enables collaborative problem-solving through asynchronous reasoning, demonstrating superior efficiency and generalization capabilities compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASTRA, a dataset and pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes in delegated authorization for LLM-driven agents, addressing risks of overly broad permissions in current authorization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current authorization methods for LLM agents grant overly broad permissions, allowing agents to access tools beyond their intended task scope, creating significant security risks.

Method: Proposed a delegated authorization model that enables semantic inspection of access requests and issues minimal-scope access tokens. Created ASTRA dataset with appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for benchmarking semantic matching.

Result: Experiments revealed both potential and limitations of model-based semantic matching, especially as task complexity increases requiring more scopes. Current techniques struggle with accurate scope-task alignment.

Conclusion: Further research is needed into semantic matching techniques for intent-aware authorization in multi-agent systems, including fine-grained control mechanisms like Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

TL;DR: MLLMs show text bias due to visual keys being out-of-distribution in the attention mechanism, not just from external data factors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why multimodal large language models prefer textual inputs over visual evidence, moving beyond external explanations like data imbalance.

Method: Extracted key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL, analyzed distributions using t-SNE visualization and Jensen-Shannon divergence metrics.

Result: Visual and textual keys occupy distinct subspaces with inter-modal divergence significantly exceeding intra-modal variation.

Conclusion: Text bias originates from intrinsic misalignment in attention key space rather than solely external data factors.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate reasoning capabilities in contemporary foundation models across different computational infrastructures and challenge conventional scaling assumptions about model performance.

Method: Three-phase experimental approach: (1) Baseline establishment with 6 models on 19 problems using HPC supercomputing, (2) Infrastructure validation repeating the benchmark on university cluster and cloud platforms, (3) Extended evaluation with full 79-problem assessment across architectural diversity.

Result: Findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions and establish that training data quality is more critical than model size for reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research contexts.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

### [166] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a minimal control interface for AI safety where agents can choose to act autonomously or defer to humans, while humans can trust or oversee. The interaction is modeled as a Markov Potential Game, providing alignment guarantees that agent autonomy improvements won't harm human values under certain structural assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop safety mechanisms for increasingly capable AI agents without modifying their underlying systems, addressing the central challenge of retaining meaningful human control while allowing autonomous operation.

Method: The method models human-agent interaction as a two-player Markov Game, specifically focusing on cases where it qualifies as a Markov Potential Game. The framework includes a control interface where agents choose between autonomous action or deferral, while humans choose between trust or oversight.

Result: The gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, agents learn to defer when uncertain and humans learn when to oversee, leading to emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations without modifying pretrained policies or reward structures.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment through a transparent control layer with predictable incentives, demonstrating conditions for intrinsic alignment where agent self-improvement doesn't harm human values.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [167] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs learn compact causal representations of filtering operations similar to functional programming's 'filter' function, with specialized attention heads encoding portable predicate representations that can be reused across different contexts and formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs implement list-processing tasks and whether they develop human-interpretable computational operations that mirror traditional programming patterns.

Method: Using causal mediation analysis on diverse list-processing tasks to identify specialized attention heads ('filter heads') that encode filtering predicates in their query states at specific tokens.

Result: Found that LLMs encode general, portable predicate representations that can be extracted and reapplied across different collections, formats, languages, and tasks. Also identified alternative filtering strategies where models eagerly evaluate predicates and store results as flags in item representations.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways surprisingly similar to functional programming patterns, revealing their ability to learn structured computational representations.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

### [168] [StructLayoutFormer:Conditional Structured Layout Generation via Structure Serialization and Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26141)
*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: StructLayoutFormer is a Transformer-based approach for generating structured layouts by representing layouts as sequences and disentangling structural information from element placements, enabling conditional structured layout generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured layouts are preferable in 2D visual content but current data-driven approaches fail to produce explicit layout structures, requiring heavy labor input for layout editing.

Method: Uses structure serialization to represent layouts as sequences and disentangles structural information from element placements using a Transformer-based architecture.

Result: Exceeds existing baselines in conditional structured layout generation and effectively extracts and transfers layout structures.

Conclusion: The approach is the first data-driven method that achieves conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout structures explicitly.

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is
