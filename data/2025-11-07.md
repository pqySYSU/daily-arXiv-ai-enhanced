*Yihao Luo,Xianglong He,Chuanyu Pan,Yiwen Chen,Jiaqi Wu,Yangguang Li,Wanli Ouyang,Yuanming Hu,Guang Yang,ChoonHwai Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Faithful Contouring is a sparse voxelized representation for 3D meshes that achieves near-lossless fidelity at 2048+ resolutions without requiring field function conversion or isosurface extraction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxelized representations based on iso-surface methods compromise geometric fidelity by requiring water-tightening or rendering optimization, which fail to preserve sharp features and internal structures of complex meshes.

Method: The proposed Faithful Contouring uses a sparse voxelized representation that directly represents arbitrary meshes without converting to field functions or extracting isosurfaces. It also includes a dual-mode autoencoder for scalable shape reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves distance errors at the 10^-5 level for direct representation, and for mesh reconstruction shows a 93% reduction in Chamfer Distance and 35% improvement in F-score compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Faithful Contouring provides superior fidelity as a 3D representation that preserves sharpness and internal structures while enabling flexible texturing, manipulation, and editing, making it highly suitable for 3D learning tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
representation for 3D learning tasks.

### [2] [LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765)
*Hyunseok Kwak,Kyeongwon Lee,Jae-Jin Lee,Woojoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoRA-Edge is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for CNNs on edge devices that uses tensor-train decomposition and selective core updates to achieve near-full fine-tuning accuracy while updating only 1.49% of parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Full fine-tuning of CNNs is infeasible on edge devices due to strict memory, compute, and energy constraints, especially for applications like Human Activity Recognition that need to handle domain shifts.

Method: Applies Tensor-Train SVD to pre-trained convolutional layers, selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization, and fuses updates back into dense kernels without changing inference cost.

Result: Achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, with 1.4-3.8x faster convergence on Jetson Orin Nano, outperforming prior parameter-efficient methods.

Conclusion: LoRA-Edge enables practical, structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation for edge platforms while preserving convolutional structure and maintaining inference efficiency.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge
applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is
infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present
LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies
Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional
layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with
zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii)
fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged.
This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of
trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full
fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves
accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of
parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines
under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and
selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1.
LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN
adaptation practical for edge platforms.

### [3] [SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819)
*Ozan Kanbertay,Richard Vogg,Elif Karakoc,Peter M. Kappeler,Claudia Fichtel,Alexander S. Ecker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SILVI is an open-source labeling software that enables annotation of behaviors and interactions in video data, bridging the gap between behavioral labeling and individual localization for training computer vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current annotation tools either support behavioral labeling without individual localization or localization without interaction detection, creating a gap for analyzing social and individualized animal behavior in video data.

Method: Developed SILVI - an open-source labeling software that integrates both behavioral annotation and individual localization functionalities, allowing researchers to annotate behaviors and interactions directly within video data.

Result: SILVI generates structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models, facilitating automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses by linking behavioral ecology with computer vision.

Conclusion: SILVI successfully bridges the gap in video annotation tools by enabling simultaneous behavioral and interaction annotation, with potential applications beyond animal behavior to human interaction analysis in dynamic scene graphs.

Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of
large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct
observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused
primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the
detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding
social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation
tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,
or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this
gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both
functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and
interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable
for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral
ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated
approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily
in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to
annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic
scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions,
is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.

### [4] [Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855)
*Duong Mai,Lawrence Hall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates using noise injection techniques during training to improve COVID-19 detection from Chest X-rays, addressing the generalization failure of deep learning models when tested on out-of-distribution data from different clinical sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for COVID-19 detection from CXRs fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data because they learn source-specific shortcuts rather than meaningful biomarkers, leading to poor performance on data from new clinical sources.

Method: The study employs fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training to make models more robust to distribution shifts and reduce reliance on source-specific artifacts.

Result: Noise injection significantly reduced the performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06 across key metrics including AUC, F1, accuracy, recall and specificity, based on results averaged over ten random seeds.

Conclusion: Simple noise injection techniques during training can effectively improve the robustness of COVID-19 detection models to distribution shifts, reducing their reliance on source-specific shortcuts and enhancing generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to
generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection
from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize
to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the
training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -
source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather
than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)
data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study
investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,
Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results
demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap
between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results
averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,
recall and specificity. Our source code is publicly available at

### [5] [Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882)
*Florence Klitzner,Blanca Inigo,Benjamin D. Killeen,Lalithkumar Seenivasan,Michelle Song,Axel Krieger,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores imitation learning for X-ray-guided spine procedures, developing a simulation sandbox and training policies for cannula alignment that achieved 68.5% first-attempt success rates and demonstrated generalization to complex anatomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if imitation learning-based robot control policies can be applied to X-ray-guided spine procedures like cannula insertion, given the complexity of interpreting multi-view X-rays in medical contexts.

Method: Created an in silico sandbox for realistic simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures, curated dataset of correct trajectories and bi-planar X-ray sequences, trained imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align cannula based on visual information alone.

Result: Policy succeeded on first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintained safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels, generalized to complex anatomy including fractures, remained robust to varied initializations, and produced plausible trajectories on real bi-planar X-rays despite simulation-only training.

Conclusion: While promising with 68.5% first-attempt success and good generalization, limitations exist in entry point precision. Future closed-loop control requires more frequent feedback, and with robust priors and domain knowledge, such models could enable lightweight CT-free robotic spinal navigation.

Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest
in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach
applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is
because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine
opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided
cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated
simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We
curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray
sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train
imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively
align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled
setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our
policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe
intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy
generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to
varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that
the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in
simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify
limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will
require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent
feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide
a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic
intra-operative spinal navigation.

### [6] [Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888)
*Abdulmumin Sa'ad,Sulaimon Oyeniyi Adebayo,Abdul Jabbar Siddiqui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhanced real-time waste detection system using pruned YOLOv12 with Self-Adversarial Training and specialized data augmentation, achieving high accuracy and efficiency for drone deployment in desert environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the global waste crisis and limitations of traditional waste collection methods, especially in remote/harsh environments like deserts, where current computer vision research focuses mainly on urban areas and recyclables, overlooking organic/hazardous waste.

Method: Proposed enhanced real-time object detection framework based on pruned, lightweight YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies, using DroneTrashNet dataset.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for drone deployment. Outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants in accuracy-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: Combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements effectively enables robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments, validated through benchmarking against existing methods.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected
to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly
in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient,
and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have
opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses
on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and
hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we
propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned,
lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT)
and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,
we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average
precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable
for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model
against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its
optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the
effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for
robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

### [7] [Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891)
*Hlali Azzeddine,Majid Ben Yakhlef,Soulaiman El Hazzat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-Based Image Composition (CoImg) improves deep learning performance on imbalanced medical datasets by fusing multiple same-class images into composite inputs, achieving near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) on retinal OCT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality lead to high false prediction rates in deep learning models for medical imaging.

Method: Proposed Class-Based Image Composition that fuses multiple images of the same class into Composite Input Images (CoImg) to enhance intra-class variance and information density per training sample. Applied to OCT retinal scans using 3x1 layout composites.

Result: Achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%), F1-score (0.995), and AUC (0.9996) on the Co-OCTDL dataset, significantly outperforming baseline models trained on raw imbalanced data with much lower false prediction rates.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses class imbalance and small sample size issues in medical imaging datasets, producing high-quality predictions even with weak datasets.

Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high
false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces
Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate
training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into
combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances
the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per
training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between
subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence
Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et
al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography
(OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a
significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version
of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout
composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we
conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant
using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical
model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed
approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved
near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared
to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also
significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality
predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample
size.

*Nand Kumar Yadav,Rodrigue Rizk,William CW Chen,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised framework for medical anomaly detection that incrementally expands a normal sample set without labels, using lightweight adapters and uncertainty-gated admission to safely refine normality definitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging where labeled anomalies are scarce and expert supervision is costly, requiring an oracle-free approach.

Method: Uses a frozen pretrained vision backbone with tiny convolutional adapters for domain adaptation. Employs k-NN anomaly scoring with compact coreset storage and dual probabilistic gates (z-score threshold and SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty) for safe sample admission.

Result: Significant performance improvements: COVID-CXR ROC-AUC from 0.9489 to 0.9982, Pneumonia CXR ROC-AUC from 0.6834 to 0.8968, Brain MRI ND-5 ROC-AUC from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211.

Conclusion: The framework effectively and efficiently handles label-scarce medical imaging applications by steadily refining normality definitions through incremental expansion with safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge
due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert
supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that
incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly
labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method
alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample
admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny
convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible
computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset
enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during
incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is
admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset
lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic
uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents
drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or
replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of
normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.
On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on
Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,
ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These
results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework
for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.

### [9] [Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943)
*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces two complementary methods for temporal action localization: Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) for precise boundary detection using signed-distance regression instead of classification, and Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) for efficient computation allocation through continuous depth selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current temporal action localization methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in boundary difficulty, leading to inefficient resource allocation and suboptimal performance.

Method: BDR uses signed-distance regression for information-theoretically optimal localization, while ATR employs continuous depth selection (τ ∈ [0,1]) for adaptive computation allocation without reinforcement learning. Knowledge distillation is used to mitigate training costs.

Result: BDR achieves 43% sharper boundary peaks and consistent 1.8-3.1% mAP@0.7 improvements across architectures. ATR achieves 56.5% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs vs 53.6% at 198G for uniform processing, providing 2.9% improvement with 18% less compute. Gains are higher (4.2%) for short actions.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide significant improvements in temporal action localization through adaptive computation and optimal boundary detection, validated across multiple benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.

Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however,
current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in
difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions.
First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically
optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than
classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to
existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8
to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive
Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection
$\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without
reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs,
compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\%
improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity,
showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via
knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at
baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous
statistical testing.

*Zhejia Cai,Puhua Jiang,Shiwei Mao,Hongkun Cao,Ruqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for joint optimization of geometry and appearance using Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction suitable for downstream editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods decouple geometry and appearance optimization, prioritizing either geometric accuracy or photorealistic rendering, which hinders downstream editing tasks like relighting and shape deformation.

Method: Simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric regularization from normal and depth maps.

Result: Obtains high-quality 3D reconstruction that can be exploited in downstream editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed unified treatment of geometry and appearance optimization enables seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization for improved 3D reconstruction quality suitable for editing applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for
applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing
methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or
photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and
appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper
advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for
seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a
novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions
and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,
leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric
regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D
reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as
relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon
acceptance.

Motivation: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is crucial but challenging for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras.

Method: Proposes linear fractional transformation parameter α to decouple main lens and micro lens array, includes analytical solution based on least squares followed by nonlinear refinement, and introduces feature detection method from raw images.

Result: Experimental results on both physical and simulated data verify the performance. The model enables faster simulation of raw light field images, which is crucial for data-driven deep learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the calibration challenge for light field cameras and enables faster simulation for deep learning applications.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging
prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we
propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled
the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an
analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement.
The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced.
Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the
performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw
light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep
learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's

### [12] [Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970)
*Sam Bahrami,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Room Envelopes, a synthetic dataset for predicting both visible surfaces and structural layout surfaces in scene reconstruction, enabling better understanding of scene extent and object placement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scene reconstruction methods only recover visible surfaces, leading to incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded surfaces. Structural elements like walls, floors and ceilings should be easier to predict due to their planar, repetitive nature, but have received less attention.

Method: Created a synthetic dataset called Room Envelopes that provides RGB images with two associated pointmaps: one for visible surfaces and one for structural layout surfaces (after removing fittings and fixtures). This enables direct supervision for monocular geometry estimators.

Result: The dataset facilitates training of feed-forward monocular geometry estimators that can predict both first visible surfaces and first layout surfaces, providing comprehensive scene understanding.

Conclusion: The Room Envelopes dataset enables improved scene reconstruction by predicting both visible and structural layout surfaces, leading to better understanding of scene extent and object shape/location.

Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
as well as the shape and location of its objects.

### [13] [Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988)
*Wenshuo Qin,Leyla Isik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D joint positions from pose estimation outperform AI vision models in predicting human social interaction judgments, with simple 3D social pose features matching full joint data's predictive power and improving AI model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humans excel at social interaction recognition while AI struggles, and test whether 3D visuospatial pose information - absent in most AI models - is key to human social perception.

Method: Combined pose and depth estimation to extract 3D joint positions from videos, compared with AI vision models, then derived minimal 3D social pose features (face position/direction) and tested their predictive power.

Result: 3D joint positions outperformed most AI vision models; minimal 3D social pose features matched full joint data's predictive strength and significantly improved AI model performance when combined with their embeddings.

Conclusion: Human social scene understanding relies on explicit 3D pose representations and can be supported by simple visuospatial primitives, with 3D social pose feature representation predicting AI models' social judgment accuracy.

Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about
others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues
like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,
the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and
social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI
vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose
information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI
vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth
estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video
clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict
human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,
3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that
key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the
learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise
embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the
critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a
compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and
direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors
matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly
improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with
their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were
represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability
to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence
that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D
pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.

TL;DR: CaRF is a novel framework for 3D Gaussian segmentation that achieves multi-view consistency by incorporating camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions and aligning per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods struggle with cross-view consistency due to reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view-specific feature learning, limiting their reliability for 3D scene understanding.

Method: Proposes Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF) with two key components: Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE) that incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian-text interactions, and In-Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) that aligns per-Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state-of-the-art methods on Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets respectively, demonstrating superior multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: CaRF enables more reliable and view-consistent 3D scene understanding with potential applications in embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.

Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

*Peiyao Wang,Weining Wang,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysCorr is a framework for improving physical consistency in text-to-video generation by introducing PhysicsRM (a dual-dimensional reward model) and PhyDPO (a physics-aware optimization pipeline) to address implausible object dynamics and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation models produce high perceptual quality but often violate physical plausibility principles, hindering deployment in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation domains.

Method: Proposes PhysicsRM - a dual-dimensional reward model quantifying intra-object stability and inter-object interactions, and PhyDPO - a direct preference optimization pipeline with contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting.

Result: Extensive experiments show PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work represents a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation, with model-agnostic and scalable integration into various video generation backbones.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive
perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles
of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics,
incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder
the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and
simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a
unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency
in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first
dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and
inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel
direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and
physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent
outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless
integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based
backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving
visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward
physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.

TL;DR: GNN-MoE enhances parameter-efficient fine-tuning for domain generalization in Vision Transformers using a Mixture-of-Experts framework with graph neural network routing on inter-patch graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning of pretrained Vision Transformers for domain generalization is computationally expensive and can harm generalization performance, creating a need for more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: Proposes GNN-MoE framework that uses Graph Neural Network routers (GCN, GAT, SAGE) operating on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts, replacing token-based routing with context-aware graph-based routing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on domain generalization benchmarks while maintaining high parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Graph-based contextual routing is effective for creating robust and lightweight domain generalization solutions for Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance
on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging;
standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose
GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead
of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT,
SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to
specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch
relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter
efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for
robust, lightweight DG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the domain gap between natural images and medical imaging by creating a foundation model specifically optimized for thoracic imaging rather than relying on out-of-domain pre-training.

Method: Pre-trained from scratch on curated multimodal dataset of 1.2M chest X-ray and CT images from 10 public sources, using novel Guided Random Resized Crops data augmentation that biases sampling towards anatomically relevant regions.

Conclusion: MedDChest provides a powerful and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting point for thoracic diagnostic tasks, with model weights to be publicly released to foster research.

Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
made publicly available to foster future research and applications.

*Arfina Rahman,Mahesh Banavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight biometric authentication system using PPG signals from fingertip videos achieves 98% accuracy with a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model that combines spatial and temporal features from time-frequency scalograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG signals offer non-invasive biometric authentication with inherent liveness detection for wearable devices, but face challenges from motion artifacts, illumination changes, and physiological variability requiring robust feature extraction.

Method: PPG signals from low-frame-rate fingertip videos are preprocessed (baseline removal, PCA motion suppression, filtering, resampling, normalization), converted to time-frequency scalograms via CWT, and processed by a hybrid CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM model combining spatial and temporal features.

Result: The system achieved 98% authentication accuracy on 46 subjects using the CFIHSR dataset, demonstrating robustness to noise and inter-subject variability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is efficient, scalable, and suitable for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications due to its accuracy, liveness detection capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in
the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric
authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness
detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal
quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and
inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and
classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective
biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from
low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings
from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The
raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline
drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude
normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG
segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient
cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed
CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision
Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long
Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects
demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the
model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,
scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is
well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bratrix is a multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment framework that projects visual and brain representations into a shared latent space using uncertainty-aware weighting and learnable semantic matrices, achieving state-of-the-art performance in EEG, MEG, and fMRI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches align neural signals directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and robustness. Subject variability and entangled visual features in neural signals pose fundamental challenges.

Method: Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, projects both into a shared latent space, incorporates uncertainty perception module for noisy neural signals, uses learnable language-anchored semantic matrices, and employs two-stage training (single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning).

Result: Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks show Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance, specifically surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Bratrix successfully achieves multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment, demonstrating superior performance in decoding neural signals and providing a robust framework for brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI
remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled
nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity
directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to
capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep
robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first
end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain
alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and
linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain
representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned
visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual
reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel
uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during
alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to
enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of
single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M
improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI
benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and
captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically
surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.

*Abu Hanif Muhammad Syarubany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares two unpaired CT image denoising methods: CycleGAN-based residual translator and Noise2Score (N2S). CycleGAN with optimized U-Net configuration achieved best performance (38.913 dB PSNR, 0.971 SSIM), while N2S showed strong performance on very noisy inputs without requiring clean pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address CT image denoising in unpaired and self-supervised settings where clean reference images are unavailable, evaluating training-data-efficient paradigms.

Method: Evaluated two approaches: 1) CycleGAN-based residual translator with optimized U-Net backbone (λ_cycle=30, λ_iden=2, ngf=ndf=64), 2) Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser for pair-free denoising.

Result: CycleGAN improved noisy input from 34.66 dB/0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB/0.971 SSIM with estimated score 1.9441 and Kaggle leaderboard score 1.9343. N2S achieved large gains on very noisy inputs and competitive performance without clean pairs.

Conclusion: CycleGAN provides strongest final image quality, while Noise2Score offers robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance, making both methods valuable for unpaired CT denoising scenarios.

Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by
evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based
residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a
common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard
U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf =
64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer
schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234
SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an
unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly
behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs,
highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN
offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust
pair-free alternative with competitive performance. Source code is available at

TL;DR: UKAST is a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical image segmentation with improved data efficiency and reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation faces challenges from complex anatomical structures and limited annotated data. CNN-based methods struggle with long-range dependencies, while Transformers are data-hungry and computationally expensive.

Method: Integrates rational-function based KANs into Swin Transformer encoders, leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) to address inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Superior accuracy in data-scarce settings with reduced FLOPs and minimal parameter increase.

Conclusion: UKAST demonstrates the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation, alleviating the data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialLock is a novel framework that uses perception signals and grounding information to achieve precise object localization in text-to-image generation, addressing the challenge of controlling spatial layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image synthesis methods fail to fully utilize positional information, leading to inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts and imprecise control over object localization.

Method: SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) that integrates spatial information through attention layers, and Position-Guided Learning (PoG) that uses perception-based supervision to refine object localization.

Result: Experiments show SpatialLock achieves state-of-the-art performance for precise object positioning with IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets, while also improving visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: The proposed SpatialLock framework effectively enables precise control over object spatial arrangements in text-to-image generation through joint utilization of perception signals and grounding information.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
across multiple datasets.

*Yunghee Lee,Byeonghyun Pak,Junwha Hong,Hoseong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THG is a training-free diffusion sampling acceleration method that treats the classifier-free guidance ODE as a multirate system, allowing different integration frequencies for noise estimation (fine grid) and guidance terms (coarse grid), reducing function evaluations by up to 30% without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity generation without requiring model retraining, by exploiting the different sensitivity of noise estimation and guidance terms to numerical errors.

Method: Reformulates CFG ODE as multirate system, uses tortoise equation for noise estimation on fine grid and hare equation for guidance on coarse grid, with error-bound-aware timestep sampler and guidance-scale scheduler.

Result: Reduces NFE by up to 30% with minimal quality loss (ΔImageReward ≤ 0.032), outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free accelerators under identical computation budgets.

Conclusion: THG demonstrates the potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, enabling real-time high-quality image synthesis without model retraining.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free
strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity
generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance
term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating
the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our
error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust
to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers
fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the
computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with
the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the
additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.
We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively
selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large
extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up
to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward
$\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free
accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the
potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for
real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch generation methods lack precise control over sketch styles and often suffer from content leakage when using reference sketches for style transfer.

Method: Proposes M3S framework that incorporates reference features as auxiliary information with linear smoothing and style-content guidance, avoiding overwriting self-attention matrices. Uses joint AdaIN module for multi-style generation.

Result: Achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment, reduced content leakage, and improved flexibility in style control, especially effective when reference and target sketches have low structural similarity.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework successfully enables explicit style guidance in sketch generation while maintaining content integrity and supporting flexible multi-style control.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime multi-object tracking faces challenges from camera motion and visual degradation in complex marine environments, which affects vessel navigation safety and maritime surveillance effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a parallel tracker with affine compensation featuring: 1) Reversible Columnar Detection Network for robust object detection, 2) Lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor for global contextual features, 3) Dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation using projective transformation and Kalman filter compensation, and 4) Clustering-optimized feature fusion module.

Result: Extensive evaluations on Singapore Maritime Dataset show DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance with the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Conclusion: DMSORT effectively addresses maritime MOT challenges by decoupling platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion, providing a robust and efficient solution for maritime environment perception.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object
tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective
maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often
causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant
challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient
Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the
framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an
object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated
branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible
Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to
leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,
a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to
capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.
Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by
constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation
within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.
Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines
motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,
occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset
demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT
attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while
maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that enables computer-use agents to learn from online video tutorials at inference time by retrieving, filtering, and converting videos into structured demonstration trajectories, then dynamically selecting relevant guidance during execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer-use agents lag behind humans in tasks requiring domain-specific procedural knowledge about applications and workflows, while humans can effectively learn from video tutorials by selectively imitating relevant segments.

Method: Proposes a framework that retrieves tutorial videos, converts them into structured trajectories using a VLM to infer UI actions, segments videos into action subsequences with textual objectives, and uses a two-stage selection mechanism to dynamically choose relevant guidance during execution.

Result: Experiments on two benchmarks show the framework consistently outperforms base agents and variants using only textual tutorials or transcripts, demonstrating improved performance through video-based guidance.

Conclusion: Online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time, with trajectory segmentation/selection, action filtering, and visual information being key components.

Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but
despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially
when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular
applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap
by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short
segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable
computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.
We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts
them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects
trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a
VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,
and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage
selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context
at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its
next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our
framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use
only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of
trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual
information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically
distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at
inference time. Our code is available at

### [28] [Seeing Straight: Document Orientation Detection for Efficient OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04161)
*Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Raja Kolla,Ali Faraz,Shaharukh Khan,Akash,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB) for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations and presents a lightweight rotation classification pipeline that achieves 96% accuracy on English and 92% on Indic languages, significantly boosting OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rotation correction is essential for enhancing OCR performance, as misalignment commonly arises from incorrect camera orientations during document capture.

Method: A fast, robust rotation classification pipeline using Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned for 4-class rotation classification.

Result: Achieved 96% accuracy on ORB-En and 92% on ORB-Indic datasets. Boosted OCR performance by up to 14% for closed-source models and 4x for open-weights models.

Conclusion: The proposed rotation classification module is highly effective for document orientation correction and significantly improves downstream OCR performance in real-world settings.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the
correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical
pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is
essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user
errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture.
In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for
evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from
rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii)
ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource
languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation
classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model
with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task
in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy
on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond
classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR
performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in
the simulated real-world setting.

*Fatemehzahra Darzi,Rodrigo Escobar Diaz Guerrero,Thomas Bocklitz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates how different color transformation techniques affect image registration between H&E stained images and non-linear multimodal images in digital pathology, finding that CycleGAN color transformation achieves the lowest registration errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate registration of images from different modalities is essential in digital pathology for applications like biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction, but registration performance can be affected by preprocessing steps like color transformation.

Method: Used 20 tissue sample pairs with various preprocessing steps including CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, and Vahadane color transformations, inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. Applied VALIS registration method with rigid followed by non-rigid registration, evaluated using relative Target Registration Error (rTRE) and custom point-based evaluation.

Result: CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors in both scenarios (original and inverted multimodal images), while other methods showed higher errors.

Conclusion: Applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology, with CycleGAN performing best among the tested methods.

Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more
images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding
anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital
pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of
information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting
applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate
registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in
digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color
transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset
of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing
steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,
Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and
denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,
which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration
in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance
was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported
the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values
(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based
evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done
separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal
images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest
registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These
findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves
alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable
analysis in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Covariance descriptors from pre-trained vision encoders outperform handcrafted features for medical image classification, with SPDNet achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with DINOv2 features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Covariance descriptors have shown strong performance in general computer vision but remain underexplored in medical imaging, prompting investigation of their effectiveness for medical image classification.

Method: Construct covariance descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (DINOv2 and MedSAM) and compare with handcrafted descriptors using SPDNet on eleven datasets from MedMNSIT benchmark.

Result: Covariance descriptors from GVE features consistently outperform handcrafted features, and SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when combined with DINOv2 features.

Conclusion: Combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders shows strong potential for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
(GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
medical image analysis.

*Hanmo Chen,Chenghao Xu,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes AStF, a novel motion style transfer method that incorporates skewness and kurtosis statistics beyond traditional mean and variance, using Style Disentanglement Module and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention with Motion Consistency Regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional motion style transfer methods relying only on mean and variance are insufficient to capture complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data, as they don't fully represent the statistical characteristics of motion styles.

Method: Proposed Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) with Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn), trained with Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator, incorporating skewness and kurtosis statistics.

Result: Experimental results show AStF achieves superior performance in motion style transfer compared to state-of-the-art methods by providing more comprehensive modeling of spatiotemporal statistical patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating higher-order statistics (skewness and kurtosis) along with mean and variance enables more effective motion style transfer by better capturing the complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data.

Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at

TL;DR: MedSapiens adapts human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, achieving state-of-the-art performance and strong few-shot learning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the untapped potential of human-centric foundation models (specifically Sapiens) for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging, leveraging their inherent spatial pose localization capabilities.

Method: Adapted Sapiens (a human-centric foundation model for pose estimation) through multi-dataset pretraining to create MedSapiens for medical imaging landmark detection.

Result: Achieved up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in average success detection rate (SDR), with 2.69% improvement in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Human-centric foundation models provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection and can be effectively adapted for medical imaging tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a
fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models
for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection
has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of
large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this
study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation
model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset
pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our
proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,
inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for
anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely
untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,
achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%
improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).
To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few
annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving
2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .

*Claudio Giusti,Luca Guarnera,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-LeakNet is an interpretable framework for AI image attribution that detects signal leaks in diffusion model latents, enabling both closed-set classification and open-set evaluation without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models has created a critical need for reliable source attribution and authenticity verification methods in computer vision systems.

Method: The framework operates in diffusion model latent space, re-simulating partial forward diffusion to expose generator-specific cues. It uses a temporal attention encoder for multi-step latent feature aggregation and a feature-weighted prototype head for transparent attribution.

Result: Achieves 98.13% Macro AUC, learns robust latent geometry that withstands post-processing, and shows strong separability between known and unseen generators, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
be available upon submission.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoGRL framework leverages DINOv2's visual priors to learn gait features for cross-modal video person re-identification, combining silhouette learning with multi-granularity feature enhancement to outperform state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VVI-ReID methods focus on modality-invariant visual features but overlook gait features, which are both modality-invariant and rich in temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model spatiotemporal consistency for cross-modal video matching.

Method: Proposed DinoGRL framework with SASGL model that generates silhouette representations using DINOv2 semantic priors and jointly optimizes them with ReID objective, plus PBMGE module that enables bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams across multiple spatial granularities.

Result: Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate superior performance, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages gait features complementary to appearance cues, achieving robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval through semantic enrichment and multi-granularity feature enhancement.

Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to
retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video
sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features
but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but
also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the
spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address
these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning
(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn
gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust
sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we
introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which
generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic
priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to
achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning.
Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity
Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations
by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams
across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity
to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly
discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FastGS is a novel acceleration framework for 3D Gaussian splatting that uses multi-view consistency to regulate Gaussian density, achieving significant training speed improvements while maintaining comparable rendering quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS acceleration methods fail to properly regulate Gaussian numbers during training, causing redundant computational overhead and poor balance between training time and rendering quality.

Method: Proposes a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, eliminating the need for budgeting mechanisms and fully considering the importance of each Gaussian.

Result: Achieves 3.32× training acceleration vs DashGaussian on Mip-NeRF 360, 15.45× acceleration vs vanilla 3DGS on Deep Blending, with comparable rendering quality. Demonstrates 2-7× acceleration across various tasks.

Conclusion: FastGS provides a simple, general acceleration framework that significantly improves training speed while maintaining rendering quality, with strong applicability across multiple 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface

simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-specific vision foundation model for herbicide trial analysis significantly outperforms general-purpose models in species identification and damage classification, especially under unseen conditions, while reducing annotation requirements by 80%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose vision models have limited performance in agriculture where fine-grained distinctions between plant species and herbicide damage types are critical for field trials.

Method: Adapted a general-purpose vision foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large curated agricultural dataset to learn domain-specific representations optimized for herbicide trial images.

Result: Domain-specific model achieved F1 score improvements from 0.91 to 0.94 for species identification and from 0.26 to 0.33 for damage classification. Under unseen conditions, gains were even greater (0.56 to 0.66 for species, 0.17 to 0.27 for damage). The model maintained strong performance in domain-shift scenarios like drone imagery.

Conclusion: Domain-specific foundation models demonstrate superior generalization capabilities and can significantly reduce manual annotation efforts by 80%, offering a scalable automated solution for herbicide trial analysis.

Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study uses synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to train YOLOv10 models for offshore infrastructure detection, demonstrating improved performance and geographic transferability with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The expansion of marine infrastructure requires effective monitoring systems, but current detection models struggle with scarce and unbalanced datasets, particularly for underrepresented object classes.

Method: Training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery from four regions, then evaluating geographic transferability on three unseen regions.

Result: The model detected 3,529 offshore platforms across three regions with F1 score of 0.85, improving to 0.90 with synthetic data, demonstrating successful generalization beyond training areas.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation effectively addresses dataset imbalance challenges in remote sensing and enables globally transferable offshore infrastructure detection using deep learning.

Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore
wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture
facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The
development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on
comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce,
particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By
training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination
of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth
quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of
Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic
training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by
applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf
of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic
transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model
generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were
detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and
1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which
improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic
data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model
performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of
offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced
datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to
address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of
deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video diffusion models fail to maintain video quality with concise prompts due to limited textual semantics understanding and inability to rephrase prompts online, limiting model scalability and usability.

Method: Introduces a Rephrasing Adapter that uses text hidden states during LLM's next token prediction as video generation condition, enabling implicit prompt rephrasing into more comprehensive representations aligned with user intent.

Result: Extensive experiments show RISE-T2V significantly enhances T2V models' ability to generate high-quality videos that better align with user intent across different video diffusion model architectures.

Conclusion: RISE-T2V is a versatile framework that can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models, significantly improving their capabilities for text-to-video tasks through integrated prompt rephrasing and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders
for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when
provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue
lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text
encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,
which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these
challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of
prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless
step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to
various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly
enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module
called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden
states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video
generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can
implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that
better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful
capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader
range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a
versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model
architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate
high-quality videos that align with user intent. Visual results are available

TL;DR: A novel two-stage method using voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks for automated 3D tumor segmentation in CT scans, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor delineation in CT scans is time-consuming and specialized, creating a bottleneck for quantitative clinical analysis. Traditional 3D CNN approaches face impracticality due to large voxel counts requiring downsampling or patching.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) voxel sparsification to reduce input data, 2) submanifold sparse convolutional networks that operate efficiently on sparse data while maintaining high-resolution 3D inputs.

Result: Achieved competitive results on KiTS23 renal cancer dataset: Dice coefficients of 95.8% (kidneys+masses), 85.7% (tumors+cysts), 80.3% (tumors alone). Computational improvements: 60% reduction in inference time and 75% reduction in VRAM usage compared to dense architectures.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables high-resolution 3D tumor segmentation with state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically reducing computational requirements, making automated tumor analysis more practical for clinical settings.

Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed
Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a
bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the
clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated
segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has
driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the
impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed,
usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when
applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem,
in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages,
voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method
allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native
3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while
significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU
memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context
of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23
challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge
winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7%
for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also
offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction
in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an
equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.

### [41] [Evaluating the Impact of Weather-Induced Sensor Occlusion on BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04347)
*Sanjay Kumar,Tim Brophy,Eoin Martino Grua,Ganesh Sistu,Valentina Donzella,Ciaran Eising*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how sensor occlusions affect 3D object detection performance in BEV-based fusion systems, showing LiDAR is more critical than cameras for maintaining accuracy under occlusion conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of sensor occlusions (from fog, haze, or obstructions) on 3D object detection accuracy in automated vehicles, particularly in BEV-based fusion systems where this effect remains underexplored.

Method: Used BEVFusion architecture evaluated on nuScenes dataset, measuring detection performance with mAP and NDS metrics under various occlusion scenarios affecting camera and LiDAR sensors separately and in fused settings.

Result: Camera-only detection dropped 41.3% in mAP under moderate occlusion, while LiDAR showed sharp 47.3% drop only under heavy occlusion. In fusion, camera occlusion caused minor 4.1% drop but LiDAR occlusion led to significant 26.8% performance decrease.

Conclusion: The model relies more heavily on LiDAR for 3D object detection, highlighting the need for occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques to handle partial sensor degradation in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate
safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial
format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although
BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through
multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by
environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D
detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.
Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the
nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera
occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is
based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance
only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),
with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect
depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%
drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%
drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task
of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into
occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that
can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or
degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chemometric methods struggle to efficiently extract spatial information from imaging data, and while deep learning offers enhanced capabilities, adoption in analytical chemistry is limited due to lack of structured guidance.

Method: Provides MATLAB code demonstrations for using existing open-source deep learning models to extract deep features from various imaging modalities, with step-by-step implementation guidance.

Result: The tutorial enables analytical chemists to process imaging data from different modalities and integrate spatial information with other data sources like spectral data.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between advanced deep learning capabilities and analytical chemistry applications by providing accessible, practical guidance for implementing existing models to extract valuable spatial information from imaging data.

Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.

### [46] [HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426)
*Alan de Aguiar,Michaella Pereira Andrade,Charles Morphy D. Santos,João Paulo Gois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HideAndSeg is a minimally supervised AI tool that combines SAM2 and YOLOv11 to automatically segment octopuses in videos, using unsupervised metrics for quality evaluation and handling occlusions in natural environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing octopuses in natural habitats is difficult due to their camouflage, rapid skin changes, non-rigid deformations, occlusions, and underwater conditions. There's a lack of large-scale annotated datasets for this task.

Method: Integrates SAM2 with custom-trained YOLOv11 object detector. Starts with user-provided point coordinates for initial SAM2 segmentation, then uses these masks to train YOLO model. The pipeline becomes fully automated using bounding box prompts to SAM2, with unsupervised metrics (temporal consistency DICE_t and new component count NC_t) for evaluation.

Result: HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory performance, reduces segmentation noise compared to manual prompting, and can re-identify octopuses after complete occlusion where manual methods fail.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical tool that reduces manual analysis needs and enables more efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their
camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body
deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable
underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated
datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised
AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative
baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained
YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate
the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data
for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by
providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further
manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal
consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively
evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of
ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,
and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory
performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted
approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods
of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually
prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world
scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more
efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a computational approach for solving convex partition jigsaw puzzles, expanding beyond traditional square puzzles by utilizing both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities with a greedy solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing jigsaw puzzle solvers focus only on square puzzles, which severely limits their practical applications. The authors aim to expand computational puzzle solving to handle convex partitions - a major subset of polygonal puzzles with convex pieces.

Method: The authors utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities between puzzle pieces and introduce a greedy solver algorithm specifically designed for convex partition puzzles.

Result: The paper reports several performance measures and introduces the first benchmark dataset for convex partition puzzles, establishing a foundation for future research in this expanded puzzle domain.

Conclusion: This work significantly expands the types of jigsaw puzzles that can be handled computationally, moving beyond square puzzles to include convex partitions, which represents a major advancement in practical puzzle solving applications.

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
dataset of such puzzles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling Large Multimodal Models to deeply integrate image interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities, moving beyond limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.

Method: V-Thinker comprises: (1) Data Evolution Flywheel for automatic synthesis, evolution, and verification of interactive reasoning datasets; (2) Visual Progressive Training Curriculum with point-level perception alignment and two-stage reinforcement learning framework.

Result: Extensive experiments show V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: V-Thinker provides valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications and represents a significant step forward in vision-centric multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

Motivation: Landslides cause severe damage, but conventional deep learning models struggle with cross-sensor, cross-region applications and limited training data, requiring more robust solutions for disaster preparedness and response.

Method: A three-axis analytical framework (sensor, label, domain) for adapting GeoFMs, focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 with global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning for landslide mapping.

Result: The model consistently outperformed task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE), showing resilience to spectral variation, accuracy under label scarcity, and reliable generalization across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: GeoFMs represent a step toward more robust and scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction, though challenges remain in computational cost and limited availability of AI-ready training data.

Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework with 8 metrics across quality, naturalness, and synchronization dimensions to address the gap in adequate evaluation metrics for talking head video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress in video generation has outpaced the development of proper evaluation metrics, with current assessment relying on limited metrics and user studies.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework with 8 metrics focusing on efficiency and human preference alignment, analyzing fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, eyebrows, and face quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on 85,000 videos from 17 state-of-the-art models revealed that while algorithms excel in lip synchronization, they struggle with generating expressiveness and artifact-free details.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark framework aims to evaluate generative method improvements and will be publicly released with original code, dataset, and leaderboards to reflect field progress.

Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is crucial in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy, where severe inflammation correlates with longer operative times and increased complication risks. Current methods lack automation for analyzing complete surgical videos without manual curation.

Method: STC-Net is a Single-Timestamp-based Complexity estimation framework that operates directly on full videos with weak temporal supervision.

Conclusion: STC-Net provides a scalable and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and surgical training applications.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with
longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The
Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for
stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos
remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete
videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,
we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity
estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal
supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed
clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal
localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading
module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft

Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy
of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by
over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision
for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable

Motivation: Existing methods struggle with joint challenges of sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics in autonomous driving scenarios.

Method: Constructs a 3D latent scaffold using pretrained foundation models, implements efficient fusion mechanism for spatio-temporal alignment, and uses dual-branch decoder with point-anchored refinement and voxel-based generation for dynamic-aware Gaussians.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and provides robust, high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside original camera coverage on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: UniSplat enables complete and detailed reconstructions with persistent memory of static Gaussians for streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,
yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,
non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a
general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction
through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent
scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic
scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively
integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an
efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,
enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed
reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware
Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with
voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to
enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust
and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera
coverage.

### [53] [PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601)
*Yicheng Xiao,Yu Chen,Haoxuan Ma,Jiale Hong,Caorui Li,Lingxiang Wu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCLIP is a novel framework that enhances CLIP's fine-grained image-text alignment by incorporating visual prompts and processing lengthy textual descriptions using an LLM-based text encoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance in pixel-level interaction and long-form text handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP enhancement methods focus on increasing visual granularity but are limited by CLIP's text encoder token length constraints, preventing effective use of detailed textual descriptions that have proven beneficial in MLLMs for fine-grained alignment.

Method: 1) Created automated annotation pipeline for pixel-level localized long-form textual descriptions, building LongGRIT dataset with 1.5M samples; 2) Replaced CLIP's text encoder with LLM; 3) Implemented three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework for arbitrary granularity alignment.

Result: PixCLIP demonstrates breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and long-form text processing, achieving state-of-the-art performance across evaluated tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed PixCLIP framework successfully synergizes visual prompt inputs and lengthy textual descriptions to achieve superior fine-grained vision-language alignment, overcoming CLIP's inherent limitations through LLM integration and pixel-level alignment mechanisms.

Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved
remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding
tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains
an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy
of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,
e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local
regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual
descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language
alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder
fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded
in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing
both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a
novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and
process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an
automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,
long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we
construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million
samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and
propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating
fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual
descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP
showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form
texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [54] [Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615)
*Tushar Kataria,Shikha Dubey,Mary Bronner,Jolanta Jedrzkiewicz,Ben J. Brintz,Shireen Y. Elhabian,Beatrice S. Knudsen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated framework to evaluate virtual IHC staining quality from H&E images, using stain accuracy metrics that directly quantify correct pixel-level labeling without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for virtual IHC stains focus on image fidelity rather than staining accuracy, creating a need for more reliable quality assessment methods.

Method: Using color deconvolution to generate masks of IHC-positive pixels from real and virtual IHC images, then computing stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) to quantify pixel-level labeling accuracy.

Result: Conventional image fidelity metrics (FID, PSNR, SSIM) correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models achieve highest accuracy while unpaired models are less reliable. WSI evaluations reveal performance declines not visible in patch-based assessments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reproducible approach for assessing virtual IHC model quality, which is crucial for accelerating clinical translation and routine use by pathologists.

Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains
from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost
alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality
remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify
image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an
automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across
sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,
we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by
each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to
compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly
quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual
annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,
including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and
pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE
achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based
models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.
Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are
invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level
benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for
assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate
translation towards routine use by pathologists.

*Kylie Cancilla,Alexander Moore,Amar Saini,Carmen Carrano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A streaming-based no-reference video quality assessment model that uses temporal modeling and synthetic degradations to predict full-reference metrics without requiring clean references or human opinion labels at inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods have limitations: full-reference metrics need clean reference videos, most no-reference models require costly human labels, and opinion-unaware methods ignore temporal context which is critical for video analysis.

Method: Leverages synthetic degradations of the DAVIS dataset to train a temporal-aware convolutional architecture that predicts FR metrics (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video without references at inference time.

Result: The streaming approach outperforms image-based baselines by generalizing across diverse degradations and achieves higher correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, demonstrating the value of temporal modeling.

Conclusion: The proposed temporal, opinion-unaware approach provides scalable VQA for real-world vision systems by effectively capturing temporal context without requiring reference videos or human labels.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but
existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require
clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on
costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are
image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In
this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both
no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of
the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to
predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without
references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our
own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations,
underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world
vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher
correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used
opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness
of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging enables eye tracking by measuring light polarization from ocular tissues, revealing trackable features not visible in intensity-only images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance eye tracking capabilities by adding polarization contrast to traditional intensity-based methods, enabling more robust tracking across different conditions.

Method: Developed a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system using a polarization-filter-array camera with linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator, and trained convolutional neural network models on data from 346 participants.

Result: PET system reduced median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10-16% compared to intensity-only baselines, showing improved performance under various conditions including eyelid occlusions and pupil-size variations.

Conclusion: Polarization effects provide practical improvements for human-computer interaction, positioning PET as a simple and robust sensing modality for future wearable devices.

Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast
mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light
reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we
demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically,
we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed
of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized
near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and
gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only
images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based
machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median
95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched
intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid
occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link
light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer
interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future
wearable devices.

### [57] [Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655)
*Ellis Brown,Jihan Yang,Shusheng Yang,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diagnostic framework to identify and mitigate non-visual biases in multimodal benchmarks by stress-testing test sets and filtering biased samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal benchmarks can be gamed without strong visual understanding due to biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns, undermining their effectiveness for evaluating true visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Test-set Stress-Test (TsT) using k-fold cross-validation with LLMs on textual inputs to reveal shortcuts and assign bias scores, plus Random Forest diagnostics; 2) Iterative Bias Pruning (IBP) to filter high-bias samples.

Result: Applied to four benchmarks (VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, VideoMME), revealing pervasive non-visual biases. Created VSI-Bench-Debiased showing reduced non-visual solvability and wider vision-blind performance gap.

Conclusion: Benchmark designers should proactively game their own benchmarks using diagnostic procedures to identify and mitigate non-visual biases, ensuring benchmarks truly require visual understanding.

Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without
strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and
superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric
benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic
principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.
Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using
diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate
non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test
set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose
benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.
Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language
Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual
inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a
bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based
diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.
Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an
``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four
benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive
non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create
VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider
vision-blind performance gap than the original.

*Ellis Brown,Arijit Ray,Ranjay Krishna,Ross Girshick,Rob Fergus,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIMS-V uses 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models, achieving efficient real-world spatial reasoning with minimal question types and small training sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space, and obtaining diverse real-world video data with precise spatial annotations is challenging.

Method: A systematic data-generation framework leveraging 3D simulators' privileged information to create spatially-rich video training data, with systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales.

Result: Identified three key question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, temporal tracking) that enable effective transfer. A 7B-parameter model trained on just 25K simulated examples outperforms larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Simulated data can efficiently develop transferable spatial intelligence, enabling robust generalization while maintaining general video understanding performance and showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models
struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial
training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage
with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this
bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that
leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich
video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we
investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world
transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We
identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement,
perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most
effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming
comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights
enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just
25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial
reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization,
maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing
substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.

*Shusheng Yang,Jihan Yang,Pinzhi Huang,Ellis Brown,Zihao Yang,Yue Yu,Shengbang Tong,Zihan Zheng,Yifan Xu,Muhan Wang,Daohan Lu,Rob Fergus,Yann LeCun,Li Fei-Fei,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift from reactive multimodal systems to 'supersensing' - a broader paradigm that includes semantic perception, streaming event cognition, implicit 3D spatial cognition, and predictive world modeling. They introduce VSI-SUPER benchmark and show that scale alone is insufficient, advocating for predictive sensing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal systems are reactive and task-driven, lacking true spatial cognition and world modeling capabilities. Progress requires moving beyond linguistic-only understanding to broader supersensing that includes spatial reasoning and predictive capabilities.

Method: Developed VSI-SUPER benchmark with two tasks: VSR (visual spatial recall) and VSC (visual spatial counting) that resist brute-force context expansion. Curated VSI-590K dataset and trained Cambrian-S model. Proposed predictive sensing approach using self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor driven by prediction error for memory and event segmentation.

Result: Achieved +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without sacrificing general capabilities. Performance on VSI-SUPER remained limited despite scaling. Predictive sensing approach substantially outperformed leading proprietary baselines on VSI-SUPER.

Conclusion: Scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. True spatial intelligence requires models that anticipate, select, and organize experience through predictive sensing, not just passive observation.

Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from
reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader
paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond
linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),
streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),
implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and
predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize
information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering
narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that
require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we
present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial
recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require
arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context
expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training
Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without
sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,
indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We
propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in
which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise
(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this
approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that
spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,
select, and organize experience.

Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for
high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent
success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Track Any State, a new task for tracking objects through transformations while detecting state changes, and presents TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after transformation and maps object state evolution over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations, but existing tracking methods often lose track of targets after significant appearance changes, limiting understanding of object dynamics.

Method: TubeletGraph identifies potentially overlooked tracks and integrates them based on semantic and proximity priors, then reasons about the added tracks to generate a state graph describing each observed transformation.

Result: TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under transformations and demonstrates deeper understanding of object transformations with promising capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses the limitation of losing track during object transformations and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding complex object state changes over time.

Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple
being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through
these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics.
However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after
transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address
this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects
through transformations while detecting and describing state changes,
accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we
present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after
transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time.
TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines
whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then,
it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each
observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking
performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of
object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and
semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional
results, and the benchmark dataset are available at

Motivation: Modern social media applications require multiple distinct aesthetic crops from images, but existing work focuses mainly on producing singular crops rather than multiple distinct ones.

Method: The authors propose using single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step, and introduce a dataset of 277 images with human labels for evaluation.

Result: The paper presents a dataset available at https://github.com/RafeLoya/carousel and evaluates the efficacy of several single-crop models combined with image partitioning.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in generating multiple distinct aesthetic crops for social media applications and provides a dataset for future research in this area.

Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived
quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed
techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem
of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we
motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications,
introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the
efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as

*Pranav Bhandari,Nicolas Fay,Sanjeevan Selvaganapathy,Amitava Datta,Usman Naseem,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a pipeline to extract and control personality traits in LLMs using Big Five Personality Traits, enabling precise behavioral steering without compromising model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a critical need for reliable mechanisms to control LLMs' implicit personalities and align them with specific requirements, as current methods lack effective behavioral manipulation during generation.

Method: A novel pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using Big Five Personality Traits, applies low-rank subspace discovery, identifies trait-specific optimal layers, and enables precise steering through dynamic layer selection.

Result: Findings show personality traits occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and these latent structures can be transformed into actionable steering mechanisms through careful perturbations without affecting fluency, variance, or general capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between psychological theory and practical model alignment, providing an effective framework for personality-aware LLM steering while preserving model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit implicit personalities in their generation, but
reliably controlling or aligning these traits to meet specific needs remains an
open challenge. The need for effective mechanisms for behavioural manipulation
of the model during generation is a critical gap in the literature that needs
to be fulfilled. Personality-aware LLMs hold a promising direction towards this
objective. However, the relationship between these psychological constructs and
their representations within LLMs remains underexplored and requires further
investigation. Moreover, it is intriguing to understand and study the use of
these representations to steer the models' behaviour. We propose a novel
pipeline that extracts hidden state activations from transformer layers using
the Big Five Personality Traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism), which is a comprehensive and empirically
validated framework to model human personality applies low-rank subspace
discovery methods, and identifies trait-specific optimal layers across
different model architectures for robust injection. The resulting
personality-aligned directions are then operationalised through a flexible
steering framework with dynamic layer selection, enabling precise control of
trait expression in LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that personality traits
occupy a low-rank shared subspace, and that these latent structures can be
transformed into actionable mechanisms for effective steering through careful
perturbations without impacting the fluency, variance and general capabilities,
helping to bridge the gap between psychological theory and practical model
alignment.

TL;DR: TextualVerifier is a verification framework that addresses TextGrad's lack of self-verification by using chain-of-thought reasoning and majority voting with LLMs, improving reasoning validity by 29% and TextGrad performance by 2.2 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TextGrad enables text-based optimization without numerical equations but lacks self-verification mechanisms to ensure reasoning validity in text-based decision making.

Method: TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow: chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and consensus aggregation, integrated non-invasively with TextGrad at loss function and optimization result verification stages.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001): 29% improvement in reasoning step validity, 2.2 percentage point gain in TextGrad performance (68.2% to 70.4%), and versioning improvements of 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92 percentage points on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.

Conclusion: TextualVerifier presents the first self-verification framework for TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients, enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in text-based optimization.

Abstract: TextGrad is a novel approach to text-based automatic differentiation that
enables composite AI systems to perform optimization without explicit numerical
equations. However, it currently lacks self-verification mechanisms that ensure
reasoning validity in text-based decision making. This research introduces
TextualVerifier, a verification framework that leverages chain-of-thought
reasoning and majority voting with large language models to address this
verification gap. TextualVerifier implements a four-stage workflow:
chain-of-thought decomposition, variant generation, majority voting, and
consensus aggregation. It integrates non-invasively with TextGrad at both the
loss function and optimization result verification stages. Experimental
evaluation using the Gemini 1.5 Pro model is conducted in two phases: (1)
standalone evaluation on PRM800K, and (2) integrated evaluation with TextGrad
on GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP benchmarks. Results show statistically
significant improvements (p < 0.001). In phase one, TextualVerifier improves
the validity of reasoning steps by 29 percent. In phase two, integration into
TextGrad loss function yields a 2.2 percentage point gain from 68.2 to 70.4
percent with a moderate overhead of 5.9 LLM calls on average. Further
evaluations of TextualVerifier versioning yield 8.08, 10.71, and 3.92
percentage point improvements on GPQA, MMLU-ML, and MMLU-CP respectively.
TextualVerifier thus presents the first self-verification framework for
TextGrad through LLM-based techniques without requiring numerical gradients,
enabling more reliable reasoning and opening new directions for verification in
text-based optimization.

Conclusion: PLLuM successfully addresses the need for Polish-language LLMs and aims to foster open research while strengthening Poland's sovereign AI technologies through public release.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a central role in modern artificial
intelligence, yet their development has been primarily focused on English,
resulting in limited support for other languages. We present PLLuM (Polish
Large Language Model), the largest open-source family of foundation models
tailored specifically for the Polish language. Developed by a consortium of
major Polish research institutions, PLLuM addresses the need for high-quality,
transparent, and culturally relevant language models beyond the English-centric
commercial landscape. We describe the development process, including the
construction of a new 140-billion-token Polish text corpus for pre-training, a
77k custom instructions dataset, and a 100k preference optimization dataset. A
key component is a Responsible AI framework that incorporates strict data
governance and a hybrid module for output correction and safety filtering. We
detail the models' architecture, training procedures, and alignment techniques
for both base and instruction-tuned variants, and demonstrate their utility in
a downstream task within public administration. By releasing these models
publicly, PLLuM aims to foster open research and strengthen sovereign AI
technologies in Poland.

### [67] [STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03827)
*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARS is a decoding-time algorithm that improves LLM alignment by iteratively sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short token segments, achieving better performance than fine-tuning methods while being more computationally efficient than Best-of-N sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aligning LLMs with human values (fine-tuning, Best-of-N sampling) are either computationally expensive or require impractical computation for optimal alignment, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: STARS (Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection Sampling) - a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments, enabling early correction of generation paths.

Result: STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates across six LLMs, while remaining competitive with Best-of-N baselines.

Conclusion: Granular, reward-guided sampling provides a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs with human values.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human values is crucial for their safe
deployment; however, existing methods, such as fine-tuning, are computationally
expensive and suboptimal. In contrast, inference-time approaches like Best-of-N
sampling require practically infeasible computation to achieve optimal
alignment. We propose STARS: Segment-level Token Alignment with Rejection
Sampling, a decoding-time algorithm that steers model generation by iteratively
sampling, scoring, and rejecting/accepting short, fixed-size token segments.
This allows for early correction of the generation path, significantly
improving computational efficiency and boosting alignment quality. Across a
suite of six LLMs, we show that STARS outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
by up to 14.9 percentage points and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by up
to 4.3 percentage points on win-rates, while remaining highly competitive with
strong Best-of-N baselines. Our work establishes granular, reward-guided
sampling as a generalizable, robust, and efficient alternative to traditional
fine-tuning and full-sequence ranking methods for aligning LLMs.

*Mikołaj Langner,Jan Eliasz,Ewa Rudnicka,Jan Kocoń*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for efficient multi-label text classification using LLMs that reformulates tasks as sequences of yes/no decisions, combined with prefix caching and distillation for improved efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional multi-label classification approaches with LLMs, particularly for short-text inference, by decomposing the task into simpler dichotomic queries.

Method: Reformulate multi-label classification as sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions for each target dimension, use prefix caching for efficiency, and apply LLM-to-SLM distillation where a powerful annotator model provides annotations to fine-tune smaller models.

Result: Fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot baselines, especially on training dimensions, with substantial efficiency gains for short-text inference without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries combined with distillation and cache-aware inference provides a scalable and effective framework for LLM-based classification, applicable across domains beyond the demonstrated affective text analysis.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficient multi-label text classification with
large language models (LLMs), built on reformulating classification tasks as
sequences of dichotomic (yes/no) decisions. Instead of generating all labels in
a single structured response, each target dimension is queried independently,
which, combined with a prefix caching mechanism, yields substantial efficiency
gains for short-text inference without loss of accuracy. To demonstrate the
approach, we focus on affective text analysis, covering 24 dimensions including
emotions and sentiment. Using LLM-to-SLM distillation, a powerful annotator
model (DeepSeek-V3) provides multiple annotations per text, which are
aggregated to fine-tune smaller models (HerBERT-Large, CLARIN-1B, PLLuM-8B,
Gemma3-1B). The fine-tuned models show significant improvements over zero-shot
baselines, particularly on the dimensions seen during training. Our findings
suggest that decomposing multi-label classification into dichotomic queries,
combined with distillation and cache-aware inference, offers a scalable and
effective framework for LLM-based classification. While we validate the method
on affective states, the approach is general and applicable across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of Machine Translation datasets for three low-resourced languages (Afan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya) reveals significant gender representation issues including male gender skew, stereotypical depictions, and harmful content against women, with more data not guaranteeing better quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the quality of Machine Translation datasets for low-resourced languages, focusing on gender representation issues and the risk of building poor-performing technologies that perpetuate societal biases when prioritizing quantity over quality.

Method: Analyzed MT datasets for three low-resourced languages (Afan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya) with focus on gender representation through examination of names, grammatical gender of verbs, stereotypical depictions, and harmful/toxic content.

Result: Found large skew towards male gender in names, verb gender, and stereotypical depictions; training data dominated by political/religious domains while benchmarks focus on news/health/sports; discovered harmful depictions against women, more prominent in language with largest dataset.

Conclusion: Quantity does not guarantee quality in low-resourced language datasets; work aims to inspire further inquiry and early mitigation of harmful content in datasets collected for low-resourced languages.

Abstract: As low-resourced languages are increasingly incorporated into NLP research,
there is an emphasis on collecting large-scale datasets. But in prioritizing
quantity over quality, we risk 1) building language technologies that perform
poorly for these languages and 2) producing harmful content that perpetuates
societal biases. In this paper, we investigate the quality of Machine
Translation (MT) datasets for three low-resourced languages--Afan Oromo,
Amharic, and Tigrinya, with a focus on the gender representation in the
datasets. Our findings demonstrate that while training data has a large
representation of political and religious domain text, benchmark datasets are
focused on news, health, and sports. We also found a large skew towards the
male gender--in names of persons, the grammatical gender of verbs, and in
stereotypical depictions in the datasets. Further, we found harmful and toxic
depictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the
largest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.
We hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for
low-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.

### [70] [GRAD: Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03900)
*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Dai Do,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAD is a decoding-time method that mitigates hallucinations in LLMs by constructing token transition graphs from retrieved corpora and adaptively fusing evidence-based logits with model logits during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination mitigation approaches rely on external knowledge sources through prompting or retrieval, but prompt-based grounding is fragile and symbolic knowledge integration is costly. GRAD aims to provide lightweight grounding using corpus-derived evidence.

Method: GRAD constructs sparse token transition graphs by accumulating next-token logits across a small retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, it max-normalizes and adaptively fuses graph-retrieved logits with model logits to favor high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency.

Result: Across three models and multiple QA benchmarks, GRAD consistently outperformed baselines, achieving up to 9.7% higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6% lower hallucination rates, and 6.9% greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, with the highest truth-informativeness product score.

Conclusion: GRAD provides a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more truthful and verifiable outputs.

Abstract: Hallucination mitigation remains a persistent challenge for large language
models (LLMs), even as model scales grow. Existing approaches often rely on
external knowledge sources, such as structured databases or knowledge graphs,
accessed through prompting or retrieval. However, prompt-based grounding is
fragile and domain-sensitive, while symbolic knowledge integration incurs heavy
retrieval and formatting costs. Motivated by knowledge graphs, we introduce
Graph-Retrieved Adaptive Decoding (GRAD), a decoding-time method that grounds
generation in corpus-derived evidence without retraining. GRAD constructs a
sparse token transition graph by accumulating next-token logits across a small
retrieved corpus in a single forward pass. During decoding, graph-retrieved
logits are max-normalized and adaptively fused with model logits to favor
high-evidence continuations while preserving fluency. Across three models and a
range of question-answering benchmarks spanning intrinsic, extrinsic
hallucination, and factuality tasks, GRAD consistently surpasses baselines,
achieving up to 9.7$\%$ higher intrinsic accuracy, 8.6$\%$ lower hallucination
rates, and 6.9$\%$ greater correctness compared to greedy decoding, while
attaining the highest truth--informativeness product score among all methods.
GRAD offers a lightweight, plug-and-play alternative to contrastive decoding
and knowledge graph augmentation, demonstrating that statistical evidence from
corpus-level token transitions can effectively steer generation toward more

TL;DR: The paper examines how humans and vision-language models perform in iterated reference games, finding that models struggle without relevant context but improve significantly with it, though the task remains challenging for AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test agents' ability to perform context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments using iterated reference games as a benchmark.

Method: Testing humans and vision-language models on iterated reference games with varying context conditions (amount, order, relevance) and measuring performance across trials.

Result: Models performed above chance but substantially worse than humans without relevant context. With relevant context, model performance increased dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents remain difficult for models.

Conclusion: Iterated reference games with abstract referents present a challenging benchmark for machine learning models, highlighting the importance of context in pragmatic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Iterated reference games - in which players repeatedly pick out novel
referents using language - present a test case for agents' ability to perform
context-sensitive pragmatic reasoning in multi-turn linguistic environments. We
tested humans and vision-language models on trials from iterated reference
games, varying the given context in terms of amount, order, and relevance.
Without relevant context, models were above chance but substantially worse than
humans. However, with relevant context, model performance increased
dramatically over trials. Few-shot reference games with abstract referents
remain a difficult task for machine learning models.

Abstract: Quantifying human flourishing, a multidimensional construct including
happiness, health, purpose, virtue, relationships, and financial stability, is
critical for understanding societal well-being beyond economic indicators.
Existing measures often lack fine spatial and temporal resolution. Here we
introduce the Human Flourishing Geographic Index (HFGI), derived from analyzing
approximately 2.6 billion geolocated U.S. tweets (2013-2023) using fine-tuned

Harvard's Global Flourishing Study framework plus attitudes towards migration
and perception of corruption. The dataset offers monthly and yearly county- and
state-level indicators of flourishing-related discourse, validated to confirm
that the measures accurately represent the underlying constructs and show
expected correlations with established indicators. This resource enables
multidisciplinary analyses of well-being, inequality, and social change at

*Fu-Chun Yang,Jason Eshraghian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces latent bridges via vector translations to enable direct semantic exchange between LLMs, improving information transfer and reducing computational overhead in multi-agent settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems pass messages as plain tokens, which discards latent semantics, constrains information transfer, and adds unnecessary computational overhead.

Method: Developed a dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct that uses learned mappings for direct semantic exchange between representation spaces, with conservative vector injection at 30% blending strength.

Result: Achieved average cosine alignment of 0.538, demonstrated stable generation without destabilizing logits, and showed 2.01:1 transfer asymmetry indicating general-purpose models yield more transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants.

Conclusion: Cross-model latent communication is feasible and enables collaborative AI systems that share meaning rather than tokens, while preserving computational stability through conservative injection.

Abstract: In multi-agent settings, such as debate, reflection, or tool-calling, large
language models (LLMs) pass messages as plain tokens, discarding most latent
semantics. This constrains information transfer and adds unnecessary
computational overhead. We form a latent bridge via vector translations, which
use learned mappings that enable direct semantic exchange between
representation spaces. A dual-encoder translator trained between Llama-2-7B and
Mistral-7B-Instruct attains an average cosine alignment of 0.538. Injecting the
translated vectors at 30 percent blending strength steers the target model's
generation without destabilizing logits. Bidirectional evaluation shows a
2.01:1 transfer asymmetry, indicating that general-purpose models yield more
transferable representations than instruction-tuned variants. This conservative
injection preserves computational stability while demonstrating that
cross-model latent communication is feasible, enabling collaborative AI systems
that share meaning rather than tokens.

TL;DR: A framework integrating abductive inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs to address incomplete evidence in RAG pipelines by detecting insufficient evidence, generating missing premises, and validating them through consistency checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in reasoning. Abductive inference offers a principled approach to bridge these gaps by generating plausible missing premises.

Method: Proposed framework integrates abductive inference into RAG systems by detecting insufficient evidence, generating candidate missing premises, and validating them through consistency and plausibility checks.

Result: Experimental results on abductive reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show improved answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness compared to standard RAG approaches.

Conclusion: Abductive inference is a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and explainability of RAG systems by addressing evidence incompleteness through principled reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval -- commonly referred to
as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) -- have demonstrated strong performance
in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG pipelines often fail when retrieved
evidence is incomplete, leaving gaps in the reasoning process. In such cases,
\emph{abductive inference} -- the process of generating plausible missing
premises to explain observations -- offers a principled approach to bridge
these gaps. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates abductive
inference into retrieval-augmented LLMs. Our method detects insufficient
evidence, generates candidate missing premises, and validates them through
consistency and plausibility checks. Experimental results on abductive
reasoning and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that our approach improves both
answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness. This work highlights abductive
inference as a promising direction for enhancing the robustness and
explainability of RAG systems.

TL;DR: T-FIX is a benchmark for evaluating LLM explanations in knowledge-intensive domains, focusing on expert alignment rather than just plausibility or faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM explanation evaluations fail to capture whether explanations align with expert intuition in domains like surgery, astronomy, and therapy where users are domain experts.

Method: Developed T-FIX benchmark spanning seven knowledge-intensive domains in collaboration with domain experts, with novel metrics to measure alignment of LLM explanations with expert judgment.

Result: The paper introduces formalized expert alignment as an evaluation criterion and presents the T-FIX benchmark framework.

Conclusion: Expert alignment is a crucial criterion for evaluating LLM explanations in knowledge-intensive settings where users are domain experts requiring explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning.

Abstract: As LLMs are deployed in knowledge-intensive settings (e.g., surgery,
astronomy, therapy), users expect not just answers, but also meaningful
explanations for those answers. In these settings, users are often domain
experts (e.g., doctors, astrophysicists, psychologists) who require
explanations that reflect expert-level reasoning. However, current evaluation
schemes primarily emphasize plausibility or internal faithfulness of the
explanation, which fail to capture whether the content of the explanation truly
aligns with expert intuition. We formalize expert alignment as a criterion for
evaluating explanations with T-FIX, a benchmark spanning seven
knowledge-intensive domains. In collaboration with domain experts, we develop
novel metrics to measure the alignment of LLM explanations with expert
judgment.

TL;DR: PoK framework enhances LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering by decomposing complex temporal questions into sub-objectives and using contrastive temporal retrieval to improve factual consistency and reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous TKGQA methods fail to fully understand complex semantic time constraints, while LLMs have strong semantic understanding but limited temporal reasoning ability and suffer from hallucination and knowledge gaps.

Method: Proposes Plan of Knowledge (PoK) framework with contrastive temporal retriever: decomposes temporal questions into sub-objectives using pre-defined tools, and constructs Temporal Knowledge Store with contrastive retrieval to selectively retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets show PoK significantly improves retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by up to 56.0%.

Conclusion: PoK effectively enhances interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning by combining structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, addressing LLMs' limitations in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA) aims to answer
time-sensitive questions by leveraging factual information from Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs). While previous studies have employed pre-trained TKG
embeddings or graph neural networks to inject temporal knowledge, they fail to
fully understand the complex semantic information of time constraints.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress,
benefiting from their strong semantic understanding and reasoning
generalization capabilities. However, their temporal reasoning ability remains
limited. LLMs frequently suffer from hallucination and a lack of knowledge. To
address these limitations, we propose the Plan of Knowledge framework with a
contrastive temporal retriever, which is named PoK. Specifically, the proposed
Plan of Knowledge module decomposes a complex temporal question into a sequence
of sub-objectives from the pre-defined tools, serving as intermediate guidance
for reasoning exploration. In parallel, we construct a Temporal Knowledge Store
(TKS) with a contrastive retrieval framework, enabling the model to selectively
retrieve semantically and temporally aligned facts from TKGs. By combining
structured planning with temporal knowledge retrieval, PoK effectively enhances
the interpretability and factual consistency of temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark TKGQA datasets demonstrate that PoK significantly
improves the retrieval precision and reasoning accuracy of LLMs, surpassing the
performance of the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods by 56.0% at most.

*Špela Vintar,Jan Jona Javoršek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares word associations between humans and large language models (LLMs), finding that while there's moderate overlap, LLM associations tend to amplify emotional content and be more predictable/less creative than human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs form word associations compared to humans, particularly for emotionally loaded words, and investigate whether LLMs can replicate human-like associative behavior and creativity mechanisms.

Method: Comparative analysis of associative behavior between humans and large language models, specifically examining responses to emotionally loaded word cues and measuring overlap, emotional amplification, and creativity levels.

Result: Moderate overlap between human and LLM associations, but LLM associations tend to amplify the emotional load of stimuli and are more predictable and less creative than human associations.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate different associative patterns than humans - while showing some similarity, they amplify emotional content and lack the unpredictability and creativity characteristic of human word associations influenced by personal experience and cognitive styles.

Abstract: Human word associations are a well-known method of gaining insight into the
internal mental lexicon, but the responses spontaneously offered by human
participants to word cues are not always predictable as they may be influenced
by personal experience, emotions or individual cognitive styles. The ability to
form associative links between seemingly unrelated concepts can be the driving
mechanisms of creativity. We perform a comparison of the associative behaviour
of humans compared to large language models. More specifically, we explore
associations to emotionally loaded words and try to determine whether large
language models generate associations in a similar way to humans. We find that
the overlap between humans and LLMs is moderate, but also that the associations
of LLMs tend to amplify the underlying emotional load of the stimulus, and that
they tend to be more predictable and less creative than human ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based model for PHI de-identification in radiology reports achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1: 0.973-0.996), outperforming commercial systems and demonstrating robust cross-institutional generalization through large-scale multimodal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by scaling transformer models with extensive training data and benchmarking against commercial systems for protected health information detection.

Method: Fine-tuned transformer-based PHI de-identification pipeline on two large annotated radiology corpora from Stanford, introduced AGE category, evaluated on test sets from Stanford and Penn, assessed synthetic PHI generation stability, and compared against commercial systems.

Result: Achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 (Penn) and 0.996 (Stanford), outperformed previous state-of-the-art, showed consistent synthetic PHI detectability (F1: 0.959), and surpassed all vendor systems (F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).

Conclusion: Transformer-based de-identification model trained on diverse radiology datasets establishes new benchmark for secure clinical text processing, outperforming academic and commercial systems while preserving data utility and ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Objective: To enhance automated de-identification of radiology reports by
scaling transformer-based models through extensive training datasets and
benchmarking performance against commercial cloud vendor systems for protected
health information (PHI) detection. Materials and Methods: In this
retrospective study, we built upon a state-of-the-art, transformer-based, PHI
de-identification pipeline by fine-tuning on two large annotated radiology
corpora from Stanford University, encompassing chest X-ray, chest CT,
abdomen/pelvis CT, and brain MR reports and introducing an additional PHI
category (AGE) into the architecture. Model performance was evaluated on test
sets from Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) for token-level
PHI detection. We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI
generation using a "hide-in-plain-sight" method and (2) performance against
commercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all
PHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the
Penn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining
the previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation
showed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50
independently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor
systems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).
Discussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional
generalization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility
while ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model
trained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial
systems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical
text processing.

### [79] [A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04103)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju,Ambuj Tewari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies k-list language identification in the limit, where learners can output k guesses at each step. It provides an exact characterization of when language collections can be k-list identified, showing this is equivalent to decomposing the collection into k subcollections that are each identifiable with single guesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical results showed language identification in the limit is impossible for most interesting language collections. Recent positive results for language generation motivated revisiting this classic problem with enhanced learner capabilities - allowing k guesses per step instead of just one.

Method: The authors develop a recursive characterization based on Angluin's original framework for single-guess identification. They prove that k-list identification is possible if and only if the language collection can be decomposed into k subcollections that are each identifiable with single guesses.

Result: The paper establishes that if a collection is k-list identifiable in the limit, it can be identified at an exponential rate, which is optimal. Conversely, if not k-list identifiable, it cannot be identified at any rate approaching zero. The characterization provides a clean decomposition criterion.

Conclusion: The work extends classical language identification theory by showing how allowing multiple guesses fundamentally changes the learnability landscape, with precise characterizations connecting list identification to decomposability of language collections.

Abstract: We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.

### [80] [Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking Reasoning Under Constraint: How Batch Prompting Suppresses Overthinking in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04108)
*Wenmo Qiu,Saurabh Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Batch prompting in LLMs not only reduces inference costs but also regularizes model behavior during multi-step reasoning, improving accuracy while cutting reasoning token usage by 3x-5x across 13 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore batch prompting as more than just a throughput optimization, investigating its potential as an inference-time regularizer for improving reasoning efficiency and reliability in Large Reasoning Models.

Method: Conducted comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks with behavioral analysis to examine how batching affects model reasoning patterns, token usage, and accuracy.

Result: Batching improves accuracy while reducing reasoning token usage by 3x-5x, suppresses overthinking, reduces hedging language, encourages decisive answers, and shows emergent collective effects where models generalize patterns from easier to harder examples.

Conclusion: Batching serves as a powerful inference-time regularizer that enables more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning, positioning it beyond just throughput optimization.

Abstract: Recent work has explored batch prompting as a strategy to amortize inference
cost in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we show that batching
offers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior
during multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a
comprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching
improves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by
3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses
overthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and
encourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent
collective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from
earlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch. These findings
position batching not just as a throughput optimization, but as a powerful
inference-time regularizer for more efficient and reliable LLM reasoning.

*Xinyuan Li,Murong Xu,Wenbiao Tao,Hanlun Zhu,Yike Zhao,Jipeng Zhang,Yunshi Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RIDE is an adversarial question-rewriting framework that uses Item Response Theory to create more challenging mathematical problems, revealing LLMs' limited robustness in mathematical reasoning with an average 21.73% performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations for mathematical reasoning may be inflated by data leakage or superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning ability, requiring more rigorous adversarial testing.

Method: Uses Item Response Theory with 35 LLMs to build a difficulty ranker, then employs reinforcement learning to guide a question-rewriting model that creates intrinsically more challenging but well-posed mathematical problems.

Result: Applied to competition-level math benchmarks, RIDE generated perturbed questions that caused an average 21.73% performance drop across 26 advanced LLMs, exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: RIDE provides a valid evaluation approach that reveals LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities are more limited than standard benchmarks suggest, demonstrating the need for rigorous adversarial testing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical
reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an
adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true
mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often
generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question
difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item
Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate
intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems.
We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their
responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning
and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across
difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks
yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with
experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing
limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our
evaluation approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CantoASR is a collaborative ASR-LALM framework that integrates forced alignment for acoustic features, LoRA-finetuned Whisper for tone discrimination, and instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction, achieving substantial CER improvements over Whisper-Large-V3 on spontaneous Cantonese data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource Cantonese ASR faces challenges due to limited annotated data, six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation, leading to high word error rates in existing models like Whisper.

Method: A collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that uses forced alignment for acoustic feature extraction, LoRA-finetuned Whisper for improved tone discrimination, and instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for prosody-aware correction.

Result: Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3.

Conclusion: Integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is critical for language accessibility,
yet low-resource Cantonese remains challenging due to limited annotated data,
six lexical tones, tone sandhi, and accent variation. Existing ASR models, such
as Whisper, often suffer from high word error rates. Large audio-language
models (LALMs), in contrast, can leverage broader contextual reasoning but
still require explicit tonal and prosodic acoustic cues. We introduce CantoASR,
a collaborative ASR-LALM error correction framework that integrates forced
alignment for acoustic feature extraction, a LoRA-finetuned Whisper for
improved tone discrimination, and an instruction-tuned Qwen-Audio for
prosody-aware correction. Evaluations on spontaneous Cantonese data show
substantial CER gains over Whisper-Large-V3. These findings suggest that
integrating acoustic cues with LALM reasoning provides a scalable strategy for
low-resource tonal and dialectal ASR.

TL;DR: This paper explores three multi-agent LLM pipelines for improving SQL generation from natural language, showing that multi-agent approaches can significantly boost performance of smaller models, with the Planner-Coder pipeline achieving the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with SQL generation due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning, while prior work focuses on impractical pipelines using flagship models, overlooking smaller efficient models.

Method: Three multi-agent pipelines: (1) Multi-agent discussion with iterative critique and refinement, (2) Planner-Coder with stepwise SQL generation plans, and (3) Coder-Aggregator with multiple independent coders and a reasoning agent.

Result: Multi-agent discussion improved small model performance by up to 10.6% execution accuracy. The Planner-Coder pipeline achieved the highest score of 56.4% accuracy with DeepSeek-R1-32B and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT from 52.4%.

Conclusion: Multi-agent LLM pipelines can effectively enhance SQL generation performance, particularly benefiting smaller models, with the Planner-Coder approach yielding the best results.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems provide a natural language interface that can enable even
laymen to access information stored in databases. However, existing Large
Language Models (LLM) struggle with SQL generation from natural instructions
due to large schema sizes and complex reasoning. Prior work often focuses on
complex, somewhat impractical pipelines using flagship models, while smaller,
efficient models remain overlooked. In this work, we explore three multi-agent
LLM pipelines, with systematic performance benchmarking across a range of small
to large open-source models: (1) Multi-agent discussion pipeline, where agents
iteratively critique and refine SQL queries, and a judge synthesizes the final
answer; (2) Planner-Coder pipeline, where a thinking model planner generates
stepwise SQL generation plans and a coder synthesizes queries; and (3)
Coder-Aggregator pipeline, where multiple coders independently generate SQL
queries, and a reasoning agent selects the best query. Experiments on the
Bird-Bench Mini-Dev set reveal that Multi-Agent discussion can improve small
model performance, with up to 10.6% increase in Execution Accuracy for
Qwen2.5-7b-Instruct seen after three rounds of discussion. Among the pipelines,
the LLM Reasoner-Coder pipeline yields the best results, with DeepSeek-R1-32B
and QwQ-32B planners boosting Gemma 3 27B IT accuracy from 52.4% to the highest
score of 56.4%. Codes are available at

*Mohammed Musthafa Rafi,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Aditya Balu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAAC proposes using LLMs as intelligent communication intermediaries to facilitate authentic knowledge exchange, addressing the problem of AI-generated content inflation and compression cycles. The paper systematically evaluates LAAC's trustworthiness across information fidelity, reproducibility, and query response integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the absurd communication theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content and recipients use LLMs to compress them back, creating a cycle where neither party engages with authentic content.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LAAC's trustworthiness using controlled experiments across multiple use cases, investigating three dimensions: information capture fidelity, reproducibility, and query response integrity through a multi-agent architecture.

Result: Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

Conclusion: While LAAC offers a promising paradigm shift for authentic communication, significant trust gaps in information fidelity, consistency, and reliability must be resolved before reliable deployment in high-stakes scenarios.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has created an absurd communication
theater where senders use LLMs to inflate simple ideas into verbose content,
recipients use LLMs to compress them back into summaries, and as a consequence
neither party engage with authentic content. LAAC (LLM as a Communicator)
proposes a paradigm shift - positioning LLMs as intelligent communication
intermediaries that capture the sender's intent through structured dialogue and
facilitate genuine knowledge exchange with recipients. Rather than perpetuating
cycles of AI-generated inflation and compression, LAAC enables authentic
communication across diverse contexts including academic papers, proposals,
professional emails, and cross-platform content generation. However, deploying
LLMs as trusted communication intermediaries raises critical questions about
information fidelity, consistency, and reliability. This position paper
systematically evaluates the trustworthiness requirements for LAAC's deployment
across multiple communication domains. We investigate three fundamental
dimensions: (1) Information Capture Fidelity - accuracy of intent extraction
during sender interviews across different communication types, (2)
Reproducibility - consistency of structured knowledge across multiple
interaction instances, and (3) Query Response Integrity - reliability of
recipient-facing responses without hallucination, source conflation, or
fabrication. Through controlled experiments spanning multiple LAAC use cases,
we assess these trust dimensions using LAAC's multi-agent architecture.
Preliminary findings reveal measurable trust gaps that must be addressed before
LAAC can be reliably deployed in high-stakes communication scenarios.

### [85] [Computational Turing Test Reveals Systematic Differences Between Human and AI Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04195)
*Nicolò Pagan,Petter Törnberg,Christopher A. Bail,Anikó Hannák,Christopher Barrie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a computational Turing test framework to validate LLM-generated text realism, systematically testing 9 LLMs across 5 calibration strategies on social media data, revealing that even calibrated LLMs remain distinguishable from human text with a trade-off between human-likeness and semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current validation of LLMs for simulating human behavior relies heavily on unreliable human-judgment-based evaluations, lacking robust tools to assess realism or calibrate models to real-world data.

Method: Developed a computational Turing test framework combining aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability, semantic similarity) with interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers, topical patterns), and systematically compared 9 open-weight LLMs across 5 calibration strategies (fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, context retrieval) on X/Twitter, Bluesky, and Reddit data.

Result: Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable from human text (especially in affective tone and emotional expression), instruction-tuned models underperform base models, scaling model size doesn't enhance human-likeness, and there's a trade-off between optimizing for human-likeness and semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable validation framework for LLM simulations while cautioning about current limitations in capturing human communication, revealing fundamental trade-offs between realism and semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the social sciences to
simulate human behavior, based on the assumption that they can generate
realistic, human-like text. Yet this assumption remains largely untested.
Existing validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --
testing whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence
that such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks
robust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating
models to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we
introduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates
aggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with
interpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to
assess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.
Second, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration
strategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval
-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly
Twitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the
literature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable
from human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.
Instruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up
model size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:
optimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and
vice versa. These results provide a much-needed scalable framework for
validation and calibration in LLM simulations -- and offer a cautionary note
about their current limitations in capturing human communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current LLMs cannot pass Poland's National Appeal Chamber exam despite good performance on multiple-choice questions, failing the practical written judgment part and showing limitations in legal reasoning and citation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically assess whether current large language models can pass professional legal qualification exams and evaluate their potential as legal exam candidates and automated judges.

Method: Used multiple LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude 4 Sonnet, Bielik-11B-v2.6) in closed-book and Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings to take the official Polish legal exam, which includes multiple-choice knowledge tests and written judgments, with automated evaluation using 'LLM-as-a-judge' approach.

Result: Models achieved satisfactory scores in knowledge tests but none met passing threshold in practical written judgments. LLM-as-a-judge evaluations often diverged from official committee judgments, showing limitations in legal reasoning and citation accuracy.

Conclusion: Current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or examiners in Polish public procurement adjudication due to susceptibility to hallucinations, incorrect legal citations, and weaknesses in logical argumentation, requiring close collaboration between legal experts and technical teams.

Abstract: This study provides an empirical assessment of whether current large language
models (LLMs) can pass the official qualifying examination for membership in
Poland's National Appeal Chamber (Krajowa Izba Odwo{\l}awcza). The authors
examine two related ideas: using LLM as actual exam candidates and applying the
'LLM-as-a-judge' approach, in which model-generated answers are automatically
evaluated by other models. The paper describes the structure of the exam, which
includes a multiple-choice knowledge test on public procurement law and a
written judgment, and presents the hybrid information recovery and extraction
pipeline built to support the models. Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4
Sonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various
Retrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the
models achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing
threshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the
'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining
committee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to
hallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical
argumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and
technical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological
progress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners
in Polish public procurement adjudication.

*Liran Cohen,Yaniv Nemcovesky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REMIND is a novel evaluation method for machine unlearning that detects residual memorization by analyzing loss patterns over small input variations, providing a more sensitive measure than single-point evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning evaluation methods focus on individual inputs but may miss residual influence in semantically similar examples, which can compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage.

Method: REMIND analyzes the model's loss landscape over small input variations, revealing that unlearned data yield flatter loss patterns while retained data show sharper, more volatile patterns.

Result: REMIND outperforms existing methods under query-based access constraints, demonstrates robustness across different models, datasets, and paraphrased inputs, and provides interpretable measures of unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: REMIND offers a reliable framework to assess unlearning in language models and provides a novel perspective on memorization and unlearning, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training data
from a model without requiring full retraining. This capability is crucial for
ensuring privacy, safety, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, verifying
whether a model has truly forgotten target data is essential for maintaining
reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing evaluation methods often
assess forgetting at the level of individual inputs. This approach may overlook
residual influence present in semantically similar examples. Such influence can
compromise privacy and lead to indirect information leakage. We propose REMIND
(Residual Memorization In Neighborhood Dynamics), a novel evaluation method
aiming to detect the subtle remaining influence of unlearned data and classify
whether the data has been effectively forgotten. REMIND analyzes the model's
loss over small input variations and reveals patterns unnoticed by single-point
evaluations. We show that unlearned data yield flatter, less steep loss
landscapes, while retained or unrelated data exhibit sharper, more volatile
patterns. REMIND requires only query-based access, outperforms existing methods
under similar constraints, and demonstrates robustness across different models,
datasets, and paraphrased inputs, making it practical for real-world
deployment. By providing a more sensitive and interpretable measure of
unlearning effectiveness, REMIND provides a reliable framework to assess
unlearning in language models. As a result, REMIND offers a novel perspective
on memorization and unlearning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pre-training leaves significant information unused in datasets; retrieval augmented generation at test time recovers this value, acting as a 5x compute multiplier and improving accuracy across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how efficiently pre-training extracts knowledge from datasets and quantify the unused dataset value left behind by current pre-training methods.

Method: Use retrieval augmented generation with test-time compute to retrieve from standard open-sourced datasets after pre-training, applying additional compute to parse retrieved context.

Result: Significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500, and SimpleQA (10 percentage point improvement on MMLU for LLaMA 3.1 8B), with retrieval acting as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone.

Conclusion: Current pre-training methods don't fully utilize information in existing datasets, leaving substantial room for improvement in dataset value extraction.

Abstract: Large language models learn from their vast pre-training corpora, gaining the
ability to solve an ever increasing variety of tasks; yet although researchers
work to improve these datasets, there is little effort to understand how
efficient the pre-training apparatus is at extracting ideas and knowledge from
the data. In this work, we use retrieval augmented generation along with
test-time compute as a way to quantify how much dataset value was left behind
by the process of pre-training, and how this changes across scale. We
demonstrate that pre-training then retrieving from standard and largely
open-sourced datasets results in significant accuracy gains in MMLU, Math-500,
and SimpleQA, which persist through decontamination. For MMLU we observe that
retrieval acts as a ~5x compute multiplier versus pre-training alone. We show
that these results can be further improved by leveraging additional compute at
test time to parse the retrieved context, demonstrating a 10 percentage point
improvement on MMLU for the public LLaMA 3.1 8B model. Overall, our results
suggest that today's pre-training methods do not make full use of the
information in existing pre-training datasets, leaving significant room for
progress.

TL;DR: A graph-based approach for topic labeling that enriches topic words with semantically related terms and analyzes their relationships to generate meaningful labels, achieving comparable performance to ChatGPT-3.5 with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of clear interpretability in topic modeling outputs and provide computationally efficient alternatives to resource-intensive methods for topic labeling.

Method: Proposed a graph-based approach that enriches topic words with semantically related terms and explores relationships among them to derive suitable labels that accurately capture each topic's meaning.

Result: The method achieved consistently better results than traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity, and produced results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5 while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The graph-based approach provides an effective and efficient solution for topic labeling, with future directions focusing on enhancing interpretability and automation in topic analysis.

Abstract: Extracting topics from text has become an essential task, especially with the
rapid growth of unstructured textual data. Most existing works rely on highly
computational methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we argue that
probabilistic and statistical approaches, such as topic modeling (TM), can
offer effective alternatives that require fewer computational resources. TM is
a statistical method that automatically discovers topics in large collections
of unlabeled text; however, it produces topics as distributions of
representative words, which often lack clear interpretability. Our objective is
to perform topic labeling by assigning meaningful labels to these sets of
words. To achieve this without relying on computationally expensive models, we
propose a graph-based approach that not only enriches topic words with
semantically related terms but also explores the relationships among them. By
analyzing these connections within the graph, we derive suitable labels that
accurately capture each topic's meaning. We present a comparative study between
our proposed method and several benchmarks, including ChatGPT-3.5, across two
different datasets. Our method achieved consistently better results than
traditional benchmarks in terms of BERTScore and cosine similarity and produced
results comparable to ChatGPT-3.5, while remaining computationally efficient.
Finally, we discuss future directions for topic labeling and highlight
potential research avenues for enhancing interpretability and automation.

### [90] [SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256)
*Kun Yang,Zikang chen,Yanmeng Wang,Zhigen Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSPO introduces sentence-level importance ratio to balance between GRPO's token-level and GSPO's response-level approaches, avoiding training collapse and improving data utilization while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing RLVR algorithms - GRPO suffers from unstable policy updates due to token-level importance ratio being affected by outliers, while GSPO has low data utilization due to response-level importance ratio causing entire responses to be discarded by clipping mechanisms.

Method: SSPO applies sentence-level importance ratio calculation and incorporates sentence entropy into PPO-CLIP to dynamically adjust clipping bounds, encouraging exploration for high-entropy tokens while narrowing clipping range for low-entropy tokens.

Result: SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: SSPO effectively leverages generated data by combining the strengths of GSPO while overcoming its limitations, demonstrating superior performance in LLM reasoning tasks through balanced sentence-level optimization.

Abstract: As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs),
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs'
reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative
Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are
observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data,
respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level,
which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected
by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation
of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high
variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO
importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common
importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean,
leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a
decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which
applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and
GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also
prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping
mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily
adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and
narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves
an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and
GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These
results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking
the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.

*Mohammad Amin Ghanizadeh,Mohammad Javad Dousti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a data selection method for fine-tuning machine translation systems that uses learnability scores and batch selection to improve data efficiency and computational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance machine translation model performance through effective data quality selection, achieving robust and reliable translation systems by focusing on the most relevant training examples.

Method: Leverages synergy between learner and reference models to define learnability scores, employs batch selection considering data interdependencies, and uses cached embeddings for efficiency.

Result: Achieves up to 5x improvement in data efficiency compared to iid baseline, 24x computational efficiency with cached embeddings, and superior translation performance over random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed data selection methodology effectively enhances both data and computational efficiency while improving generalization and translation quality in machine translation systems.

Abstract: Data quality and its effective selection are fundamental to improving the
performance of machine translation models, serving as cornerstones for
achieving robust and reliable translation systems. This paper presents a data
selection methodology specifically designed for fine-tuning machine translation
systems, which leverages the synergy between a learner model and a pre-trained
reference model to enhance overall training effectiveness. By defining a
learnability score, our approach systematically evaluates the utility of data
points for training, ensuring that only the most relevant and impactful
examples contribute to the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, our method employs
a batch selection strategy which considers interdependencies among data points,
optimizing the efficiency of the training process while maintaining a focus on
data relevance. Experiments on English to Persian and several other language
pairs using an mBART model fine-tuned on the CCMatrix dataset demonstrate that
our method can achieve up to a fivefold improvement in data efficiency compared
to an iid baseline. Experimental results indicate that our approach improves
computational efficiency by 24 when utilizing cached embeddings, as it requires
fewer training data points. Additionally, it enhances generalization, resulting
in superior translation performance compared to random selection method.

Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability for temporal reasoning by testing them on historical trivia questions from 1940, examining how language (English vs Norwegian) and model size affect performance.

Method: Used Norwegian book from 1940 with trivia questions, prompted LLMs to answer as if it were 1940 in both English and Norwegian, employed LLM-as-judge for grading with human verification.

Result: English prompting consistently outperformed Norwegian prompting, larger LLMs showed improved results, tested DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, Llama3.1 families and largest Norwegian-specific LLM.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate temporal reasoning capabilities but perform better in English than Norwegian despite the Norwegian-specific context, with model size being a significant factor in performance.

Abstract: In this study, we experiment with the ability of LLMs to do temporal
reasoning. Using a Norwegian book from 1940 containing trivia questions, we
prompt the LLMs to answer the questions as if it were 1940. We also pose the
questions in both English and Norwegian. Correct answers are often presented as
sentences, and grading is done by means of LLM-as-judge, with sampled checks by
a native speaker. Prompting in English consistently gave better results than in
Norwegian, an unexpected result. In contrast, using larger LLMs improved
results. We tested the DeepSeek-R1, Gemma3, Qwen3, and Llama3.1 model families,
and also the largest available LLM especially crafted for Norwegian.

*Fabian Schmidt,Seyedehmoniba Ravan,Vladimir Vlassov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PTTSD is a probabilistic framework for depression detection from clinical interviews that predicts PHQ-8 scores with uncertainty estimates using sequence models with Gaussian/Student-t outputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-only systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing depression severity prediction models lack uncertainty estimates and temporal modeling, which are essential for clinical decision support.

Method: Proposes PTTSD framework with sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants using bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, residual connections, and Gaussian/Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only systems (MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC-WOZ) with well-calibrated prediction intervals, confirmed through ablations and comparisons with MentalBERT.

Conclusion: The framework provides interpretable and clinically relevant uncertainty-aware forecasting for depression severity prediction, with attention and probabilistic modeling proving valuable.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable predictions of depression severity are essential
for clinical decision support, yet existing models often lack uncertainty
estimates and temporal modeling. We propose PTTSD, a Probabilistic Textual Time
Series Depression Detection framework that predicts PHQ-8 scores from
utterance-level clinical interviews while modeling uncertainty over time. PTTSD
includes sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-one variants, both combining
bidirectional LSTMs, self-attention, and residual connections with Gaussian or
Student-t output heads trained via negative log-likelihood. Evaluated on E-DAIC
and DAIC-WOZ, PTTSD achieves state-of-the-art performance among text-only
systems (e.g., MAE = 3.85 on E-DAIC, 3.55 on DAIC) and produces well-calibrated
prediction intervals. Ablations confirm the value of attention and
probabilistic modeling, while comparisons with MentalBERT establish generality.
A three-part calibration analysis and qualitative case studies further
highlight the interpretability and clinical relevance of uncertainty-aware
forecasting.

TL;DR: ThaiOCRBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks, addressing the underrepresentation of Thai in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented, especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding.

Method: Created a diverse, human-annotated dataset with 2,808 samples across 13 task categories and evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings, including both proprietary and open-source systems.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) significantly outperform open-source counterparts, with fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content extraction showing the steepest performance drops among open-source models.

Conclusion: ThaiOCRBench provides a standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex settings and identifies key challenges like language bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content for improving Thai-language document understanding.

Abstract: We present ThaiOCRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
vision-language models (VLMs) on Thai text-rich visual understanding tasks.
Despite recent progress in multimodal modeling, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on high-resource languages, leaving Thai underrepresented,
especially in tasks requiring document structure understanding. ThaiOCRBench
addresses this gap by offering a diverse, human-annotated dataset comprising
2,808 samples across 13 task categories. We evaluate a wide range of
state-of-the-art VLMs in a zero-shot setting, spanning both proprietary and
open-source systems. Results show a significant performance gap, with
proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) outperforming open-source
counterparts. Notably, fine-grained text recognition and handwritten content
extraction exhibit the steepest performance drops among open-source models.
Through detailed error analysis, we identify key challenges such as language
bias, structural mismatch, and hallucinated content. ThaiOCRBench provides a
standardized framework for assessing VLMs in low-resource, script-complex
settings, and provides actionable insights for improving Thai-language document
understanding.

*Nikhil Abhyankar,Purvi Chaurasia,Sanchit Kabra,Ananya Srivastava,Vivek Gupta,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RUST-BENCH is a new benchmark for tabular reasoning that uses 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables across science (NSF grants) and sports (NBA stats) domains, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that use small, uniform tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks use small, uniform tables that don't represent real-world complexity, giving an incomplete view of LLMs' reasoning abilities on heterogeneous, domain-specific data requiring multi-hop reasoning.

Method: Created RUST-BENCH with 7966 questions from 2031 real tables across NSF grant records (RB-Science) and NBA statistics (RB-Sports), evaluating LLMs on scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity.

Result: Experiments show LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.

Conclusion: RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research by better representing real-world table complexity.

Abstract: Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform
tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an
incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real
tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields
with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To
address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from
2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records)
and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates
LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning
complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs
struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing
persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies.

*Cuong Huynh,Jie Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The OUNLP system for TSAR-2025 uses LLM-prompting for readability-controlled text simplification, discovering that performance depends on the CEFR level gap between source and target texts. They propose two multi-round methods (MRS-Rule and MRS-Joint) using GPT-4o, achieving 7th place among 20 teams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from discovering that text simplification performance is highly dependent on the gap between source and target CEFR levels, leading to the development of multi-round simplification approaches to handle larger complexity gaps effectively.

Method: Two multi-round simplification methods using GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based LLM simplification (MRS-Joint), where the latter uses LLM-simplified candidates as starting points for further improvement.

Result: The submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams in the TSAR-2025 Shared Task. Later improvements with MRS-Joint showed that using LLM-simplified candidates as starting points could further boost multi-round simplification performance.

Conclusion: Multi-round simplification approaches, particularly MRS-Joint that leverages LLM-simplified candidates as starting points, effectively handle the challenge of large CEFR level gaps in text simplification tasks and show promising performance improvements.

Abstract: This paper describes the OUNLP system submitted to the TSAR-2025 Shared Task
(Alva-Manchego et al., 2025), designed for readability-controlled text
simplification using LLM-prompting-based generation. Based on the analysis of
prompt-based text simplification methods, we discovered an interesting finding
that text simplification performance is highly related to the gap between the
source CEFR (Arase et al., 2022) level and the target CEFR level. Inspired by
this finding, we propose two multi-round simplification methods and generate
them via GPT-4o: rule-based simplification (MRS-Rule) and jointly rule-based
LLM simplification (MRS-Joint). Our submitted systems ranked 7 out of 20 teams.
Later improvements with MRS-Joint show that taking the LLM simplified
candidates as the starting point could further boost the multi-round
simplification performance.

TL;DR: This paper systematically evaluates personality traits in six LLMs using the Big Five Inventory-2 framework, finding significant differences across personality dimensions and temperature sensitivity in Neuroticism and Extraversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become integral to human-centered applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is important for responsible development and deployment.

Method: Applied the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) framework to systematically evaluate six LLMs under varying sampling temperatures, using hierarchical clustering to analyze model similarities.

Result: Found significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with Neuroticism and Extraversion particularly susceptible to temperature adjustments. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct model clusters suggesting architectural features may predispose certain models toward stable trait profiles.

Conclusion: The results offer new insights into personality-like pattern emergence in LLMs and provide a new perspective on model tuning, selection, and ethical governance of AI systems.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to human-centered
applications, understanding their personality-like behaviors is increasingly

significant differences across four of the five personality dimensions, with
Neuroticism and Extraversion susceptible to temperature adjustments. Further,
hierarchical clustering reveals distinct model clusters, suggesting that

*Joshua Gao,Quoc Huy Pham,Subin Varghese,Silwal Saurav,Vedhus Hoskere*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGalyst is an automated, human-aligned agentic framework for evaluating domain-specific RAG systems, featuring synthetic QA dataset generation and optimized LLM-as-a-Judge metrics that correlate with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluation frameworks use heuristic metrics that fail to capture domain-specific nuances and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches that lack validated human alignment, creating challenges for evaluating RAG systems in safety-critical domains.

Method: RAGalyst uses an agentic pipeline to generate synthetic QA datasets from source documents with filtering for data fidelity, and refines Answer Correctness and Answerability metrics through prompt optimization to achieve strong human correlation.

Result: Evaluation across military operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering domains showed highly context-dependent performance - no single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter configuration was universally optimal. The framework also identified common low Answer Correctness reasons.

Conclusion: Systematic evaluation frameworks like RAGalyst are necessary to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and enable informed design choices for building reliable RAG systems, as performance varies significantly across different contexts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical technique for grounding
Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual evidence, yet evaluating RAG systems in
specialized, safety-critical domains remains a significant challenge. Existing
evaluation frameworks often rely on heuristic-based metrics that fail to
capture domain-specific nuances and other works utilize LLM-as-a-Judge
approaches that lack validated alignment with human judgment. This paper
introduces RAGalyst, an automated, human-aligned agentic framework designed for
the rigorous evaluation of domain-specific RAG systems. RAGalyst features an
agentic pipeline that generates high-quality, synthetic question-answering (QA)
datasets from source documents, incorporating an agentic filtering step to
ensure data fidelity. The framework refines two key LLM-as-a-Judge
metrics-Answer Correctness and Answerability-using prompt optimization to
achieve a strong correlation with human annotations. Applying this framework to
evaluate various RAG components across three distinct domains (military
operations, cybersecurity, and bridge engineering), we find that performance is
highly context-dependent. No single embedding model, LLM, or hyperparameter
configuration proves universally optimal. Additionally, we provide an analysis
on the most common low Answer Correctness reasons in RAG. These findings
highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation framework like RAGalyst,
which empowers practitioners to uncover domain-specific trade-offs and make
informed design choices for building reliable and effective RAG systems.

### [99] [Modeling Clinical Uncertainty in Radiology Reports: from Explicit Uncertainty Markers to Implicit Reasoning Pathways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04506)
*Paloma Rabaey,Jong Hak Moon,Jung-Oh Lee,Min Gwan Kim,Hangyul Yoon,Thomas Demeester,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework to quantify two types of uncertainty in radiology reports: explicit uncertainty from hedging phrases and implicit uncertainty from omitted findings, creating an enriched benchmark called Lunguage++ for uncertainty-aware medical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain valuable clinical information but are often unstructured and contain uncertainty that hinders automated analysis. Existing approaches struggle with quantifying uncertainty levels from hedging phrases and determining whether omitted findings are truly absent or just unmentioned.

Method: A two-part framework: (1) Quantify explicit uncertainty using an expert-validated LLM-based reference ranking of hedging phrases mapped to probability values; (2) Model implicit uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds characteristic sub-findings from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for 14 common diagnoses.

Result: Development of Lunguage++, an expanded uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark that enables uncertainty-aware image classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and investigation into clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses both explicit and implicit uncertainty in radiology reports, creating a valuable resource that advances uncertainty-aware medical analysis and diagnostic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Radiology reports are invaluable for clinical decision-making and hold great
potential for automated analysis when structured into machine-readable formats.
These reports often contain uncertainty, which we categorize into two distinct
types: (i) Explicit uncertainty reflects doubt about the presence or absence of
findings, conveyed through hedging phrases. These vary in meaning depending on
the context, making rule-based systems insufficient to quantify the level of
uncertainty for specific findings; (ii) Implicit uncertainty arises when
radiologists omit parts of their reasoning, recording only key findings or
diagnoses. Here, it is often unclear whether omitted findings are truly absent
or simply unmentioned for brevity. We address these challenges with a two-part
framework. We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,
LLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding
to a probability value based on this reference. In addition, we model implicit
uncertainty through an expansion framework that systematically adds
characteristic sub-findings derived from expert-defined diagnostic pathways for
14 common diagnoses. Using these methods, we release Lunguage++, an expanded,
uncertainty-aware version of the Lunguage benchmark of fine-grained structured
radiology reports. This enriched resource enables uncertainty-aware image
classification, faithful diagnostic reasoning, and new investigations into the
clinical impact of diagnostic uncertainty.

*Amir Zur,Atticus Geiger,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Eric Bigelow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether language models internally represent alternate reasoning paths during generation, using hidden activations to control and predict model uncertainty in chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if language models represent the different reasoning paths they could take during text generation, since token selection can lead to very different paths making uncertainty difficult to quantify.

Method: Using hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning, testing the correlation between model uncertainty and how easily it can be steered through activation interventions.

Result: Found clear correlation between model uncertainty at different tokens and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. Activation interventions are most effective when alternate paths are available. Hidden activations can predict the model's future outcome distribution.

Conclusion: Language models implicitly represent the space of possible reasoning paths, with activation interventions being most effective when the model hasn't committed to a particular final answer.

Abstract: When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens
might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult
to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models
represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test
this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language
model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we
find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens,
and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This
suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are
alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet
committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations
can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models
implicitly represent the space of possible paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between automated essay scoring systems and user understanding by providing an interactive, explainable approach to analyzing argumentative essays through visual argumentation graphs.

Method: Structures essays as argumentation graphs with claims as nodes, evidence as node properties, and supporting/attacking relations as edges. Uses LLMs for initial classification and scoring, then visualizes results with justifications and quantitative coherence measures.

Result: Developed an interactive system that enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human oversight, with tools for better understanding essays in natural language.

Conclusion: IntelliProof successfully bridges structural semantics of argumentative essays with user understanding, providing an enhanced analytical experience through LLM-powered argumentation graph visualization and interactive tools.

Abstract: We present IntelliProof, an interactive system for analyzing argumentative
essays through LLMs. IntelliProof structures an essay as an argumentation
graph, where claims are represented as nodes, supporting evidence is attached
as node properties, and edges encode supporting or attacking relations. Unlike
existing automated essay scoring systems, IntelliProof emphasizes the user
experience: each relation is initially classified and scored by an LLM, then
visualized for enhanced understanding. The system provides justifications for
classifications and produces quantitative measures for essay coherence. It
enables rapid exploration of argumentative quality while retaining human
oversight. In addition, IntelliProof provides a set of tools for a better
understanding of an argumentative essay and its corresponding graph in natural
language, bridging the gap between the structural semantics of argumentative
essays and the user's understanding of a given text. A live demo and the system

*Cyril Vallez,Alexander Sternfeld,Andrei Kucharavy,Ljiljana Dolamic*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper shows that even the latest open-weight LLMs remain vulnerable to known security issues in code generation, and introduces new metrics (Prompt Exposure and Model Exposure) to better assess and prioritize vulnerability risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-based coding assistants become more critical in software development, understanding and addressing the security vulnerabilities they generate becomes increasingly important for cybersecurity.

Method: The authors introduce two new metrics: Prompt Exposure (PE) which accounts for vulnerability severity, generation chance, and prompt formulation; and Model Exposure (ME) which indicates the severity and prevalence of vulnerabilities a model generates.

Result: The study found that even the latest open-weight models remain vulnerable to the earliest reported vulnerability scenarios in realistic use settings, suggesting that safety-functionality trade-offs have prevented effective vulnerability patching.

Conclusion: The proposed PE and ME metrics can help prioritize and mitigate the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code, addressing the current limitations in vulnerability assessment and patching.

Abstract: As the role of Large Language Models (LLM)-based coding assistants in
software development becomes more critical, so does the role of the bugs they
generate in the overall cybersecurity landscape. While a number of LLM code
security benchmarks have been proposed alongside approaches to improve the
security of generated code, it remains unclear to what extent they have
impacted widely used coding LLMs. Here, we show that even the latest
open-weight models are vulnerable in the earliest reported vulnerability
scenarios in a realistic use setting, suggesting that the safety-functionality
trade-off has until now prevented effective patching of vulnerabilities. To
help address this issue, we introduce a new severity metric that reflects the
risk posed by an LLM-generated vulnerability, accounting for vulnerability
severity, generation chance, and the formulation of the prompt that induces
vulnerable code generation - Prompt Exposure (PE). To encourage the mitigation
of the most serious and prevalent vulnerabilities, we use PE to define the
Model Exposure (ME) score, which indicates the severity and prevalence of
vulnerabilities a model generates.

TL;DR: DeReC is a lightweight fact verification framework that uses dense retrieval and classification instead of LLMs, achieving better accuracy with 92-95% faster runtime while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based fact verification systems face computational inefficiency and hallucination risks, making them impractical for real-world deployment despite their effectiveness.

Method: Combines dense retrieval with specialized classification using general-purpose text embeddings to replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification.

Result: Reduces runtime by 95% on RAWFC (23m36s vs 454m12s) and 92% on LIAR-RAW (134m14s vs 1692m23s), achieves 65.58% F1 score on RAWFC surpassing L-Defense (61.20%).

Conclusion: Carefully engineered retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized tasks while being significantly more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation necessitates robust yet computationally
efficient fact verification systems. While current state-of-the-art approaches
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating explanatory rationales,
these methods face significant computational barriers and hallucination risks
in real-world deployments. We present DeReC (Dense Retrieval Classification), a
lightweight framework that demonstrates how general-purpose text embeddings can
effectively replace autoregressive LLM-based approaches in fact verification
tasks. By combining dense retrieval with specialized classification, our system
achieves better accuracy while being significantly more efficient. DeReC
outperforms explanation-generating LLMs in efficiency, reducing runtime by 95%
on RAWFC (23 minutes 36 seconds compared to 454 minutes 12 seconds) and by 92%
on LIAR-RAW (134 minutes 14 seconds compared to 1692 minutes 23 seconds),
showcasing its effectiveness across varying dataset sizes. On the RAWFC
dataset, DeReC achieves an F1 score of 65.58%, surpassing the state-of-the-art
method L-Defense (61.20%). Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered
retrieval-based systems can match or exceed LLM performance in specialized

TL;DR: A compact design space for shellular metamaterials with few degrees of freedom enables efficient GPU-based homogenization and inverse design for tailored mechanical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a highly expressive yet compact representation for shellular metamaterials that enables efficient exploration and inverse design of structures with specific macroscopic properties.

Method: Developed a compact design space with few degrees of freedom representing diverse geometries, coupled with GPU-based homogenization pipeline for fast evaluation (20ms) and elastic tensor computation (0.5s), enabling exhaustive design space exploration and inverse-design schemes.

Result: Generated structures exhibit geometric diversity and wide mechanical response spectrum, achieving up to 91.86% of theoretical upper bounds, comparable to state-of-the-art shellular structures with low solid volume. Prototypes confirmed manufacturability via additive manufacturing.

Conclusion: The compact design space and efficient computational pipeline enable practical inverse design of shellular metamaterials with tailored properties, demonstrating high performance and manufacturability for real-world engineering applications.

Abstract: We introduce a compact yet highly expressive design space for shellular
metamaterials. By employing only a few dozen degrees of freedom, this design
space represents geometries ranging from simple planar configurations to
complex triply periodic minimal surfaces. Coupled with this representation, we
develop an efficient GPU-based homogenization pipeline that evaluates the
structure in under 20 ms and computes the corresponding effective elastic
tensor in near-real-time (0.5 s). The high speed of this evaluation facilitates
an exhaustive exploration of the design space and supports an inverse-design
scheme that tailors the shellular structure to specific macroscopic target
property. Structures derived through this approach exhibit not only geometric
diversity but also a wide spectrum of mechanical responses, covering a broad
range of material properties. Moreover, they achieve up to 91.86% of
theoretical upper bounds, a level of performance comparable to state-of-the-art
shellular structures with low solid volume. Finally, our prototypes, fabricated
via additive manufacturing, confirm the practical manufacturability of these
designs, underscoring their potential for real-world engineering applications.

TL;DR: DreamGym is a unified framework that synthesizes diverse experiences for scalable online RL training of autonomous agents, using reasoning-based environment models instead of costly real rollouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Practical adoption of RL for LLM agents is challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity that obstruct scalable experience data collection.

Method: DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model for consistent state transitions and feedback, uses an experience replay buffer initialized with offline data, and adaptively generates challenging tasks for curriculum learning.

Result: DreamGym substantially improves RL training across diverse environments, outperforms baselines by over 30% on non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions, and provides significant performance gains with fewer real-world interactions.

Conclusion: DreamGym enables scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL by training policies on synthetic experiences that transfer effectively to real environments while requiring far fewer real-world interactions.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

*Ahmed Mostafa,Raisul Arefin Nahid,Samuel Mulder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper evaluates NLP tokenization models for assembly code analysis, examining how tokenizer choices affect vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and performance in downstream tasks like function signature prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis but remains underexplored, with significant impacts on vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and downstream task performance that need systematic evaluation.

Method: Conducted thorough study of various tokenization models with systematic analysis of encoding efficiency and semantic capture. Evaluated preprocessing customization and pre-tokenization rules for assembly code, using state-of-the-art models (Llama 3.2, BERT, BART) across multiple performance metrics.

Result: Tokenizer choice significantly influences downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. Complex trade-offs exist between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their practical utility in assembly code tasks.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights for optimizing tokenization models in low-level code analysis, contributing to robustness and scalability of NLM-based binary analysis workflows.

Abstract: Tokenization is fundamental in assembly code analysis, impacting intrinsic
characteristics like vocabulary size, semantic coverage, and extrinsic
performance in downstream tasks. Despite its significance, tokenization in the
context of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to
address this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary
size. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules
tailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we
assess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a
critical problem in binary code analysis.
  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,
systematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and
capturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare
tokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and
representational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained
models such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the
encoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate
the effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.
Preliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences
downstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete
predictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex
trade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in
practical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable
insights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,
contributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model
(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.

TL;DR: BehaviorLens framework compares text vs image representations of user behavior data for MLLMs, finding image representations improve next-purchase prediction accuracy by 87.5% over text without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether textual or image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) performance in reasoning over sequential user-behavior data.

Method: Developed BehaviorLens benchmarking framework to assess modality trade-offs across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as text paragraphs, scatter plots, and flowcharts using a real-world purchase-sequence dataset.

Result: When data is represented as images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy improved by 87.5% compared to equivalent textual representation without any additional computational cost.

Conclusion: Image representations of user behavior data are significantly more effective than text representations for improving MLLM performance in next-purchase prediction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are reshaping how modern agentic
systems reason over sequential user-behavior data. However, whether textual or
image representations of user behavior data are more effective for maximizing
MLLM performance remains underexplored. We present \texttt{BehaviorLens}, a
systematic benchmarking framework for assessing modality trade-offs in
user-behavior reasoning across six MLLMs by representing transaction data as
(1) a text paragraph, (2) a scatter plot, and (3) a flowchart. Using a
real-world purchase-sequence dataset, we find that when data is represented as
images, MLLMs next-purchase prediction accuracy is improved by 87.5% compared
with an equivalent textual representation without any additional computational
cost.

TL;DR: KnowThyself is a chat-based interpretability tool that simplifies LLM analysis through natural language queries, interactive visualizations, and guided explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM interpretability tools are fragmented and code-intensive, creating barriers for users who want to understand model behavior without deep technical expertise.

Method: Uses an orchestrator LLM to reformulate queries, an agent router to direct them to specialized modules, and contextualizes outputs into coherent explanations within a conversational interface.

Result: Provides a consolidated, accessible platform that lowers technical barriers for LLM inspection through interactive visualizations and guided explanations.

Conclusion: KnowThyself offers an extensible foundation for accessible LLM interpretability by embedding the entire analysis process into a conversational workflow.

Abstract: We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language
model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain
fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into
a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language
questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At
its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router
further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally
contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical
barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding
the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust
foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.

### [110] [Extracting Causal Relations in Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03948)
*Kevin Hong,Kia Karbasi,Gregory Pottie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DKT's effectiveness comes from modeling prerequisite causal relationships between knowledge components, not bidirectional relationships as previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the prevailing explanation that DKT's performance gains stem from bidirectional KC relationships and demonstrate its true strength lies in modeling causal prerequisite structures.

Method: Pruned exercise relation graphs into DAGs, trained DKT on causal subsets of Assistments dataset, and proposed alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned representations.

Result: DKT's predictive capabilities align strongly with causal structures, and empirical evidence supports that it approximates causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational mappings.

Conclusion: DKT's effectiveness is driven by its capacity to model prerequisite causal relationships between knowledge components, not bidirectional relationships.

Abstract: A longstanding goal in computational educational research is to develop
explainable knowledge tracing (KT) models. Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which
leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and
performance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over
traditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem
from its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different
knowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a
student's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this
paper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's
strength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a
causal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise
relation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal
subsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities
align strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an
alternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned
representations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim. Our
findings suggest that DKT's effectiveness is largely driven by its capacity to
approximate causal dependencies between KCs rather than simple relational
mappings.

### [111] [LLMs and Cultural Values: the Impact of Prompt Language and Explicit Cultural Framing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03980)
*Bram Bulté,Ayla Rigouts Terryn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show cultural bias despite language and cultural framing in prompts, consistently favoring values from Netherlands, Germany, US, and Japan while producing neutral responses with selective progressive stances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can represent cultural diversity given imbalances in training data and optimization objectives, and examine how prompt language and cultural framing influence model alignment with human values across different countries.

Method: Probed 10 LLMs with 63 items from Hofstede Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, formulated as prompts with and without explicit cultural perspectives.

Result: Prompt language and cultural perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but models show systematic bias toward values from Netherlands, Germany, US, and Japan. Models produce neutral responses with selective progressive stances on social tolerance. Cultural framing improves alignment more than targeted prompt language.

Conclusion: LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle ground - responsive enough to produce variation with prompts but too anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent cultural diversity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted by users across the
globe, who interact with them in a diverse range of languages. At the same
time, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and
optimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs
can represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,
we look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and
cultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human
values in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede
Values Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and
formulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural
perspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural
perspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:
While targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the
direction of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not
overcome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a
restricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,
and Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably
similar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with
selective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment
with cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit
cultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,
combining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an
English prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle
ground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,
but too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent
cultural diversity.

*Zhuowen Yuan,Tao Liu,Yang Yang,Yang Wang,Feng Qi,Kaushik Rangadurai,Bo Li,Shuang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArchPilot is a multi-agent system that addresses computational inefficiency in automated ML engineering by using proxy-based evaluation and adaptive search instead of repeated full training runs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the computational overhead, limited scalability, and slow iteration cycles caused by repeated full training runs in current LLM-based agents for automated ML engineering.

Method: A multi-agent framework with three specialized agents: orchestration agent using MCTS-inspired algorithm with restart mechanism, generation agent for iterative architecture development, and evaluation agent for proxy training and performance scoring.

Result: ArchPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines like AIDE and ML-Master on MLE-Bench, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The multi-agent collaboration in ArchPilot enables efficient ML engineering under limited budgets by prioritizing high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training runs.

Abstract: Recent LLM-based agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in automated ML
engineering. However, they heavily rely on repeated full training runs to
evaluate candidate solutions, resulting in significant computational overhead,
limited scalability to large search spaces, and slow iteration cycles. To
address these challenges, we introduce ArchPilot, a multi-agent system that
integrates architecture generation, proxy-based evaluation, and adaptive search
into a unified framework. ArchPilot consists of three specialized agents: an
orchestration agent that coordinates the search process using a Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired novel algorithm with a restart mechanism and
manages memory of previous candidates; a generation agent that iteratively
generates, improves, and debugs candidate architectures; and an evaluation
agent that executes proxy training runs, generates and optimizes proxy
functions, and aggregates the proxy scores into a fidelity-aware performance
metric. This multi-agent collaboration allows ArchPilot to prioritize
high-potential candidates with minimal reliance on expensive full training
runs, facilitating efficient ML engineering under limited budgets. Experiments
on MLE-Bench demonstrate that ArchPilot outperforms SOTA baselines such as AIDE
and ML-Master, validating the effectiveness of our multi-agent system.

TL;DR: This paper introduces anomaly detection for multi-agent AI systems to identify failures like drift, cycles, and missing details. It presents a dataset curation pipeline and two benchmark datasets with 4,275 and 894 trajectories, showing that supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) methods achieve up to 98% and 96% accuracy respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-Agentic AI systems powered by LLMs are non-deterministic and prone to silent failures that are difficult to detect, creating a need for systematic anomaly detection methods.

Method: Developed a dataset curation pipeline capturing user behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Created two benchmark datasets and evaluated supervised (XGBoost) and semi-supervised (SVDD) anomaly detection approaches.

Result: Supervised XGBoost achieved 98% accuracy and semi-supervised SVDD achieved 96% accuracy on the benchmark datasets containing 4,275 and 894 trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems.

Conclusion: This work provides the first systematic study of anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks, and insights that demonstrate both supervised and semi-supervised approaches can effectively detect anomalies in agentic trajectories.

Abstract: Multi-Agentic AI systems, powered by large language models (LLMs), are
inherently non-deterministic and prone to silent failures such as drift,
cycles, and missing details in outputs, which are difficult to detect. We
introduce the task of anomaly detection in agentic trajectories to identify
these failures and present a dataset curation pipeline that captures user
behavior, agent non-determinism, and LLM variation. Using this pipeline, we
curate and label two benchmark datasets comprising \textbf{4,275 and 894}
trajectories from Multi-Agentic AI systems. Benchmarking anomaly detection
methods on these datasets, we show that supervised (XGBoost) and
semi-supervised (SVDD) approaches perform comparably, achieving accuracies up
to 98% and 96%, respectively. This work provides the first systematic study of
anomaly detection in Multi-Agentic AI systems, offering datasets, benchmarks,

*Hirohane Takagi,Gouki Minegishi,Shota Kizawa,Issey Sukeda,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but systematically amplify them, and irrelevant context causes consistent shifts in magnitude representations with varying downstream effects by model size, revealing vulnerabilities in decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying representational mechanisms of numerical reasoning errors in LLMs, specifically how they integrate multiple numerical attributes and how irrelevant numerical context affects these representations.

Method: Combined linear probing with partial correlation analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.

Result: LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to systematically amplify them, and irrelevant context induces consistent shifts in magnitude representations with downstream effects that vary by model size.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute entanglement.

Abstract: Although behavioral studies have documented numerical reasoning errors in
large language models (LLMs), the underlying representational mechanisms remain
unclear. We hypothesize that numerical attributes occupy shared latent
subspaces and investigate two questions:(1) How do LLMs internally integrate
multiple numerical attributes of a single entity? (2)How does irrelevant
numerical context perturb these representations and their downstream outputs?
To address these questions, we combine linear probing with partial correlation
analysis and prompt-based vulnerability tests across models of varying sizes.
Our results show that LLMs encode real-world numerical correlations but tend to
systematically amplify them. Moreover, irrelevant context induces consistent
shifts in magnitude representations, with downstream effects that vary by model
size. These findings reveal a vulnerability in LLM decision-making and lay the
groundwork for fairer, representation-aware control under multi-attribute
entanglement.

### [115] [Agentmandering: A Game-Theoretic Framework for Fair Redistricting via Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04076)
*Hao Li,Haotian Chen,Ruoyuan Gong,Juanjuan Wang,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentmandering is a game-theoretic framework that uses LLM agents to simulate strategic redistricting negotiations between opposing political parties, reducing partisan bias and achieving more stable outcomes than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computational redistricting methods focus on generating legally valid maps but ignore strategic selection processes, allowing partisan actors to cherry-pick politically advantageous maps despite technical compliance.

Method: The framework uses turn-based negotiation between two LLM agents representing opposing political interests, employing a Choose-and-Freeze protocol where agents alternate selecting and freezing districts from candidate maps to gradually partition the state.

Result: Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data shows Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and unfairness while achieving 2-3 orders of magnitude lower variance than standard baselines, with particularly strong performance in swing-state scenarios.

Conclusion: Agentmandering demonstrates that embedding strategic interaction into redistricting via LLM agents can produce fairer and more stable outcomes than traditional ensemble-based approaches.

Abstract: Redistricting plays a central role in shaping how votes are translated into
political power. While existing computational methods primarily aim to generate
large ensembles of legally valid districting plans, they often neglect the
strategic dynamics involved in the selection process. This oversight creates
opportunities for partisan actors to cherry-pick maps that, while technically
compliant, are politically advantageous. Simply satisfying formal constraints
does not ensure fairness when the selection process itself can be manipulated.
We propose \textbf{Agentmandering}, a framework that reimagines redistricting
as a turn-based negotiation between two agents representing opposing political
interests. Drawing inspiration from game-theoretic ideas, particularly the
\textit{Choose-and-Freeze} protocol, our method embeds strategic interaction
into the redistricting process via large language model (LLM) agents. Agents
alternate between selecting and freezing districts from a small set of
candidate maps, gradually partitioning the state through constrained and
interpretable choices. Evaluation on post-2020 U.S. Census data across all
states shows that Agentmandering significantly reduces partisan bias and
unfairness, while achieving 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower variance than
standard baselines. These results demonstrate both fairness and stability,
especially in swing-state scenarios. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-KGFR is a collaborative framework where LLMs work with a structured retriever (KGFR) to handle knowledge-intensive questions, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen knowledge graphs through efficient propagation and iterative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge, while existing methods are limited by dataset-specific tuning and poor scalability on large or unseen graphs.

Method: The framework uses a Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR) that encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities based on question roles. It employs Asymmetric Progressive Propagation (APP) for efficient large graph handling, with node-, edge-, and path-level interfaces for iterative reasoning.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while maintaining scalability and generalization.

Conclusion: LLM-KGFR provides a practical solution for KG-augmented reasoning by combining LLMs with structured retrievers for scalable and generalizable knowledge-intensive question answering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning but struggle with
knowledge-intensive questions due to limited context and parametric knowledge.
However, existing methods that rely on finetuned LLMs or GNN retrievers are
limited by dataset-specific tuning and scalability on large or unseen graphs.
We propose the LLM-KGFR collaborative framework, where an LLM works with a
structured retriever, the Knowledge Graph Foundation Retriever (KGFR). KGFR
encodes relations using LLM-generated descriptions and initializes entities
based on their roles in the question, enabling zero-shot generalization to
unseen KGs. To handle large graphs efficiently, it employs Asymmetric
Progressive Propagation (APP)- a stepwise expansion that selectively limits
high-degree nodes while retaining informative paths. Through node-, edge-, and
path-level interfaces, the LLM iteratively requests candidate answers,
supporting facts, and reasoning paths, forming a controllable reasoning loop.
Experiments demonstrate that LLM-KGFR achieves strong performance while
maintaining scalability and generalization, providing a practical solution for
KG-augmented reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing quality through human-centered benchmarking, addressing both simulation quality (realistic test conversations) and evaluation quality (accurate response assessment).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice AI agents are scaling to billions of daily interactions, but organizations lack objective methods to assess testing reliability, creating a critical measurement gap in production deployments.

Method: Combines psychometric techniques (pairwise comparisons, Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence intervals, permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to provide reproducible metrics for any testing approach.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation of three commercial platforms using 21,600 human judgments revealed significant performance differences: Evalion achieved 0.92 evaluation quality (f1-score) vs 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality vs 0.43 for others.

Conclusion: The framework enables empirical validation of testing capabilities, providing essential measurement foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale, with supporting materials available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence
intervals, and permutation tests) with rigorous statistical validation to
provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms
focused on Voice AI Testing using 21,600 human judgments across 45 simulations
and ground truth validation on 60 conversations. Results reveal statistically
significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.
  This framework enables researchers and organizations to empirically validate
the testing capabilities of any platform, providing essential measurement
foundations for confident voice AI deployment at scale. Supporting materials
are made available to facilitate reproducibility and adoption.

### [118] [When Empowerment Disempowers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04177)
*Claire Yang,Maya Cakmak,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Empowerment-based AI assistance designed for single humans can cause disempowerment of other humans in multi-human environments, revealing alignment challenges in multi-agent contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how empowerment-based assistance objectives, which work well for single humans, perform in multi-human settings where they may inadvertently disempower other humans.

Method: Created Disempower-Grid test suite and conducted empirical studies showing assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's empowerment can reduce another human's environmental influence and rewards.

Result: Found that empowerment-based assistance for one human can significantly disempower other humans in multi-agent environments, though joint empowerment mitigates this at the cost of user rewards.

Conclusion: Goal-agnostic objectives that appear aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent contexts, revealing broader alignment challenges for the AI community.

Abstract: Empowerment, a measure of an agent's ability to control its environment, has
been proposed as a universal goal-agnostic objective for motivating assistive
behavior in AI agents. While multi-human settings like homes and hospitals are
promising for AI assistance, prior work on empowerment-based assistance assumes
that the agent assists one human in isolation. We introduce an open source
multi-human gridworld test suite Disempower-Grid. Using Disempower-Grid, we
empirically show that assistive RL agents optimizing for one human's
empowerment can significantly reduce another human's environmental influence
and rewards - a phenomenon we formalize as disempowerment. We characterize when
disempowerment occurs in these environments and show that joint empowerment
mitigates disempowerment at the cost of the user's reward. Our work reveals a
broader challenge for the AI alignment community: goal-agnostic objectives that
seem aligned in single-agent settings can become misaligned in multi-agent
contexts.

TL;DR: The Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework provides a probabilistic-normative model for quantifying workflow quality and efficiency through reward functions and normative penalties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable systematic comparison, scoring, and optimization of workflows by integrating correctness, reliability, and cost into a coherent mathematical framework.

Method: Combines Opus Workflow Reward (probabilistic function for expected performance) with Opus Workflow Normative Penalties (measurable functions for structural/informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene).

Result: A unified framework that supports automated workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization, and can be integrated into Reinforcement Learning loops for workflow discovery and refinement.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables direct comparison and optimization of workflows through a joint Reward-Penalty trade-off formulation, facilitating workflow discovery and refinement in modern automation systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Workflow Evaluation Framework, a
probabilistic-normative formulation for quantifying Workflow quality and
efficiency. It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a
coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and
optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a
probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success
likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative
Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational
quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It
supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern
automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement
Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we
introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a
probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus
Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related
properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation
for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty
trade-offs.

*Zhengru Fang,Yu Guo,Jingjing Wang,Yuang Zhang,Haonan An,Yinhai Wang,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent predictive coding framework that enables agents to develop efficient communication and social representations (artificial social place cells) for spatial coordination under bandwidth constraints, achieving graceful performance degradation compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sharing consistent spatial memory in multi-agent systems where partial observability and limited bandwidth often cause coordination failures.

Method: Uses a multi-agent predictive coding framework with information bottleneck objective, grid-cell-like metric for spatial coding, hierarchical reinforcement learning policy, and emergent communication mechanisms that develop social place cells.

Result: Achieved 73.5% to 64.4% success rate on Memory-Maze benchmark as bandwidth decreased from 128 to 4 bits/step, significantly outperforming full-broadcast baseline (67.6% to 28.6%).

Conclusion: The approach establishes a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from predictive drives, leading to social collective intelligence.

Abstract: Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical
challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited
bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a
multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the
minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information
bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to
communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a
grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization,
emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon
this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient
communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode
partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells
(SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical
reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint
uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional
resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to
64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast
baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically
principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social
representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social
collective intelligence.

### [121] [RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285)
*Zeng Zhiyuan,Jiashuo Liu,Zhangyue Yin,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLoop introduces an iterative policy initialization framework that addresses RL overfitting in verifiable reward systems by converting transient policy variations into robust performance gains through cycles of exploration and exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve RL overfitting where models gain training rewards but lose generalization due to policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions during training.

Method: RLoop uses iterative policy initialization with cycles of RL exploration from a given policy, filtering successful trajectories to create expert datasets, then refining the initial policy via Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) for the next iteration.

Result: RLoop substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL, while mitigating forgetting.

Conclusion: The iterative re-initialization framework effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains, addressing key challenges in RL training dynamics.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for
training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical
challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose
generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy
over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated
during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy
diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework
built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard
training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the
solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to
create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting
point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via
iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations
into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting
and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and
pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-360° is a large-scale dataset and benchmark for computer-using agents (CUAs) that addresses gaps in real-world tasks, automated multi-modal trajectory collection, and unified evaluation of GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three persistent gaps in CUA research: scarcity of real-world tasks, lack of automated pipelines for multi-modal trajectory collection, and absence of unified benchmarks for joint evaluation of GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.

Method: Used an LLM-augmented automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering to create a dataset with over 1.2M action steps across Windows office applications.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset with full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata, goals, reasoning traces, and action trajectories. Benchmarking revealed substantial shortcomings in current vision-language models for grounding and action prediction, with supervised fine-tuning and RL providing improvements but not reaching human-level reliability.

Conclusion: GUI-360° provides a valuable resource to accelerate research on robust desktop computer-using agents, addressing critical gaps in the field and enabling reproducible evaluation across multiple CUA tasks.

Abstract: We introduce GUI-360$^\circ$, a large-scale, comprehensive dataset and
benchmark suite designed to advance computer-using agents (CUAs). CUAs present
unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of
real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines
for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that
jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction.
  GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated
pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task
instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The
released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of
trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes
full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available,
instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and
failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI
grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action
space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box
shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to
human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to
facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop
CUAs.

### [123] [Probing the Probes: Methods and Metrics for Concept Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04312)
*Jacob Lysnæs-Larsen,Marte Eggen,Inga Strümke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals that high probe accuracy in Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) doesn't guarantee concept alignment and shows probes often capture spurious correlations. It introduces spatial linear attribution for concept localization and proposes three metrics to assess concept alignment beyond accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of probe accuracy as a measure of concept alignment in explainable AI, as probes often capture spurious correlations rather than intended concepts.

Method: Introduces spatial linear attribution for concept localization, compares it with existing feature visualization techniques, and proposes three alignment metrics: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

Result: Demonstrates that deliberately misaligned probes achieve similar accuracy to standard probes, and shows that translation-invariant and spatially-aligned probes consistently improve concept alignment.

Conclusion: Probe accuracy alone is unreliable for assessing concept alignment; alignment-based evaluation metrics and probe design tailored to model architecture and target concept are essential for faithful concept representation.

Abstract: In explainable AI, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are typically obtained
by training linear classifier probes to detect human-understandable concepts as
directions in the activation space of deep neural networks. It is widely
assumed that a high probe accuracy indicates a CAV faithfully representing its
target concept. However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone
is an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV
captures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to
capture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended
concept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned
probes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close
to that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a
novel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and
provide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization
techniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further
propose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept
alignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness. Our
analysis shows that probes with translation invariance and spatial alignment
consistently increase concept alignment. These findings highlight the need for
alignment-based evaluation metrics rather than probe accuracy, and the
importance of tailoring probes to both the model architecture and the nature of
the target concept.

Conclusion: AdversariaLLM addresses critical fragmentation issues in LLM safety research by providing a robust, extensible toolbox that enables reproducible and comparable studies across different attack methods and evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RxSafeBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, featuring 2,443 high-quality clinical consultation scenarios with embedded medication risks to test LLMs' ability to recommend safe medications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research exists on medication safety of LLMs in healthcare due to lack of real-world datasets constrained by privacy issues, and underexplored evaluation in realistic clinical consultation settings.

Method: Proposed framework simulates clinical consultations with embedded medication risks, constructs RxRisk DB with 6,725 contraindications and 28,781 drug interactions, and uses two-stage filtering to create RxSafeBench benchmark with structured multiple choice questions.

Result: Current LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge, especially when risks are implied rather than explicit, highlighting challenges in ensuring medication safety.

Conclusion: RxSafeBench advances safer AI-driven clinical decision support by providing the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medication safety in LLMs, with insights for improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.

### [126] [Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV):Formalising Metacognitive Theory for Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04341)
*Nick Oh,Fernand Gobet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework that extends existing Generate-Verify paradigms by adding explicit monitoring processes based on metacognitive theories, aiming to address the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time reasoning architectures lack monitoring processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin, leading to the prefix dominance trap where models commit early to suboptimal paths and rarely recover, causing approximately 20% accuracy loss.

Method: The authors formalize Flavell's and Nelson and Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the MGV framework that adds explicit monitoring before generation begins and refines future monitoring through verification feedback.

Result: No empirical validation is presented, but the work provides the first systematic computational translation of foundational metacognitive theories and offers a principled vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures.

Conclusion: The MGV framework suggests specific architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs by incorporating metacognitive monitoring processes to prevent early commitment to suboptimal reasoning paths.

Abstract: Test-time reasoning architectures such as those following the Generate-Verify
paradigm -- where a model iteratively refines or verifies its own generated
outputs -- prioritise generation and verification but exclude the monitoring
processes that determine when and how reasoning should begin. This omission may
contribute to the prefix dominance trap, in which models commit early to
suboptimal reasoning paths and seldom recover, yielding roughly 20% accuracy
loss. We address this architectural gap by formalising Flavell's and Nelson and
Narens' metacognitive theories into computational specifications, proposing the
Monitor-Generate-Verify (MGV) framework. MGV extends the Generate-Verify
paradigm by adding explicit monitoring that captures metacognitive experiences
(from difficulty assessments to confidence judgements) before generation begins
and refines future monitoring through verification feedback. Though we present
no empirical validation, this work provides the first systematic computational
translation of foundational metacognitive theories, offering a principled
vocabulary for understanding reasoning system failures and suggesting specific
architectural interventions for future test-time reasoning designs.

*Chanwoo Park,Ziyang Chen,Asuman Ozdaglar,Kaiqing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative RMFT is a post-training method that repeatedly fine-tunes LLMs on their own low-regret decision trajectories to improve decision-making performance across diverse models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with basic online decision-making problems, failing to achieve low regret or effective exploration-exploitation tradeoffs despite being increasingly deployed as decision-making agents.

Method: Iterative regret-minimization fine-tuning that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base model by rolling out multiple trajectories, selecting the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tuning on them.

Result: Improves LLMs' decision-making performance across diverse models (Transformers, open-weight LLMs, GPT-4o mini) and enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons, action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts.

Conclusion: Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities, with theoretical insight showing Transformers can act as no-regret learners under this paradigm.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as "agents" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.

*Anisha Garg,Ganesh Venkatesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoRPO improves upon GRPO by using an adaptive baseline that prevents reinforcement of failed trajectories and transitions to relative preference mode once quality threshold is met, enabling better learning from ordinal rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's simplicity becomes problematic when using ordinal rewards for partial credit, as its group-average baseline can positively reinforce failed trajectories and incorrect behavior.

Method: CoRPO introduces an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold to prevent positive reinforcement of failed solutions, then transitions to relative preference mode for optimization once threshold is consistently met.

Result: Empirical validation on code verification task shows CoRPO achieves more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization compared to GRPO.

Conclusion: CoRPO represents a critical advancement in enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback, progressing from binary to ordinal rewards and paving the way for denser, per-step supervision.

Abstract: Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly
desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this
simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with
richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit,
GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a
positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior.
  We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new
formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that
enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never
positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the
baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the
model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We
empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates
more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization.
  This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to
enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning.
We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback
- progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to
denser, per-step supervision.

*Carnot Braun,Rafael O. Jarczewski,Gabriel U. Talasso,Leandro A. Villas,Allan M. de Souza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVe combines classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning to create personalized vehicle routing that understands complex human contexts like multi-step tasks and preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional routing systems only optimize simple metrics like time/distance and cannot handle complex human contexts such as multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs.

Method: Uses a hybrid approach: multi-objective Dijkstra algorithm generates candidate routes, then an LLM agent evaluates them against user tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules using pre-processed geospatial POI cache.

Result: Achieved over 88% accuracy in initial route selections with a local model, successfully integrating complex user intent into appropriate route modifications in realistic urban scenarios.

Conclusion: Combining classical routing algorithms with LLM-based semantic reasoning is a robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable urban mobility solutions.

Abstract: Traditional vehicle routing systems efficiently optimize singular metrics
like time or distance, and when considering multiple metrics, they need more
processes to optimize . However, they lack the capability to interpret and
integrate the complex, semantic, and dynamic contexts of human drivers, such as
multi-step tasks, situational constraints, or urgent needs. This paper
introduces and evaluates PAVe (Personalized Agentic Vehicular Routing), a
hybrid agentic assistant designed to augment classical pathfinding algorithms
with contextual reasoning. Our approach employs a Large Language Model (LLM)
agent that operates on a candidate set of routes generated by a multi-objective
(time, CO2) Dijkstra algorithm. The agent evaluates these options against
user-provided tasks, preferences, and avoidance rules by leveraging a
pre-processed geospatial cache of urban Points of Interest (POIs). In a
benchmark of realistic urban scenarios, PAVe successfully used complex user
intent into appropriate route modifications, achieving over 88% accuracy in its
initial route selections with a local model. We conclude that combining
classical routing algorithms with an LLM-based semantic reasoning layer is a
robust and effective approach for creating personalized, adaptive, and scalable
solutions for urban mobility optimization.

*Lars Krupp,Daniel Geißler,Vishal Banwari,Paul Lukowicz,Jakob Karolus*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the environmental impact of web agents, revealing significant energy and CO2 costs through theoretical estimation and empirical benchmarking, and advocates for energy efficiency metrics in web agent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored sustainability issues in web agent research, particularly the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with autonomous web interactions by AI agents.

Method: Combined theoretical estimation and empirical benchmarking approaches to measure energy and CO2 costs of different web agent architectures and interaction patterns.

Result: Found that different web agent design philosophies significantly impact energy consumption, with no direct correlation between higher energy use and better performance. Also identified lack of transparency in model parameters as a limitation for accurate energy estimation.

Conclusion: Calls for a paradigm shift in web agent evaluation to include dedicated energy consumption metrics in benchmarks, emphasizing the need for sustainable AI development practices.

Abstract: Web agents, like OpenAI's Operator and Google's Project Mariner, are powerful
agentic systems pushing the boundaries of Large Language Models (LLM). They can
autonomously interact with the internet at the user's behest, such as
navigating websites, filling search masks, and comparing price lists. Though
web agent research is thriving, induced sustainability issues remain largely
unexplored. To highlight the urgency of this issue, we provide an initial
exploration of the energy and $CO_2$ cost associated with web agents from both
a theoretical -via estimation- and an empirical perspective -by benchmarking.
Our results show how different philosophies in web agent creation can severely
impact the associated expended energy, and that more energy consumed does not
necessarily equate to better results. We highlight a lack of transparency
regarding disclosing model parameters and processes used for some web agents as
a limiting factor when estimating energy consumption. Our work contributes
towards a change in thinking of how we evaluate web agents, advocating for
dedicated metrics measuring energy consumption in benchmarks.

TL;DR: LLMs can replicate human decision-making patterns in game theory experiments, with Llama closely matching human cooperation behaviors and Qwen aligning with Nash equilibrium predictions, enabling systematic exploration of novel experimental spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making, as misalignment could cause harmful outcomes in practical applications while failure to replicate human behavior makes LLMs ineffective for social simulations.

Method: Developed a digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introduced a systematic prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation, testing three open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen).

Result: Llama reproduced human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligned closely with Nash equilibrium predictions. Achieved population-level behavioral replication without persona-based prompting.

Conclusion: Appropriately calibrated LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary approach to traditional research that generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.

*Zihang Ding,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven sparse sensing framework integrated with EPA-SWMM optimizes sensor placement and reconstructs peak flowrates in stormwater systems, achieving high accuracy with minimal sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban surface water flooding is increasingly frequent, but high-resolution flood monitoring faces practical constraints in time, budget, and technology. There's a need to monitor drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained resources.

Method: Integrated DSS framework with EPA-SWMM: used SWMM to generate training dataset of peak flowrate profiles, applied singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR factorization for sensor allocation to identify optimal monitoring nodes.

Result: Three optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction performance with NSE values of 0.92-0.95. The framework showed good robustness to measurement uncertainty and location-dependent robustness to sensor failures that improves with more sensors.

Conclusion: The DSS framework balances computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. It can be integrated with predictive models for flood early warning and real-time control under limited sensing resources.

Abstract: Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.

*Daniel Gomm,Cornelius Wolff,Madelon Hulsebos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes query ambiguity as cooperative interaction between users and systems, develops a framework to distinguish cooperative vs uncooperative queries, and analyzes 15 datasets to show current evaluations inadequately mix query types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle query ambiguities, but current approaches treat ambiguity as a deficiency rather than embracing it as a feature of cooperative interaction.

Method: Developed a principled framework to distinguish cooperative queries (resolvable interpretations) from uncooperative queries, then applied this framework to analyze queries in 15 popular tabular datasets.

Result: Analysis revealed uncontrolled mixing of query types in existing datasets, making them inadequate for evaluating both execution accuracy and interpretation capabilities of systems.

Conclusion: The framework shifts perspective from fixing ambiguity to embracing cooperation in query resolution, enabling more informed design and evaluation of natural language interfaces for tabular data.

Abstract: Natural language interfaces to tabular data must handle ambiguities inherent
to queries. Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a
feature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query
specification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled
framework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a
resolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.
Applying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and
analysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an
uncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's
execution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our
framework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity
to embracing cooperation in resolving queries. This reflection enables more
informed design and evaluation for natural language interfaces for tabular
data, for which we outline implications and directions for future research.

### [135] [Question the Questions: Auditing Representation in Online Deliberative Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04588)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for auditing question selection in deliberative processes using justified representation concepts, with efficient algorithms and real-world applications comparing moderator-chosen, optimized, and LLM-generated questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting representative questions from many participants in deliberative processes like citizens' assemblies, where time constraints limit how many questions can be posed to experts.

Method: Developed an auditing framework based on justified representation (JR) from social choice theory, with efficient algorithms (O(mn log n) runtime), and applied it to compare moderator-selected questions, ILP-optimized questions, and LLM-generated summary questions.

Result: Applied methods to historical deliberations, revealing both promise and limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes, and integrated the framework into an online platform used globally.

Conclusion: The framework enables practitioners to audit and improve representation in deliberative processes, providing tools to ensure questions better represent participants' collective interests.

Abstract: A central feature of many deliberative processes, such as citizens'
assemblies and deliberative polls, is the opportunity for participants to
engage directly with experts. While participants are typically invited to
propose questions for expert panels, only a limited number can be selected due
to time constraints. This raises the challenge of how to choose a small set of
questions that best represent the interests of all participants. We introduce
an auditing framework for measuring the level of representation provided by a
slate of questions, based on the social choice concept known as justified
representation (JR). We present the first algorithms for auditing JR in the
general utility setting, with our most efficient algorithm achieving a runtime
of $O(mn\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of participants and $m$ is the number
of proposed questions. We apply our auditing methods to historical
deliberations, comparing the representativeness of (a) the actual questions
posed to the expert panel (chosen by a moderator), (b) participants' questions
chosen via integer linear programming, (c) summary questions generated by large
language models (LLMs). Our results highlight both the promise and current
limitations of LLMs in supporting deliberative processes. By integrating our
methods into an online deliberation platform that has been used for over
hundreds of deliberations across more than 50 countries, we make it easy for
practitioners to audit and improve representation in future deliberations.

### [136] [DR. WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04646)
*Narjes Nourzad,Hanqing Yang,Shiyu Chen,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DR.WELL is a decentralized neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning that uses symbolic planning and a two-phase negotiation protocol to enable robust coordination without requiring detailed trajectory alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative multi-agent planning faces challenges with partial information, limited communication, and brittle trajectory-level coordination where small timing deviations cause conflicts.

Method: Two-phase negotiation protocol: agents propose candidate roles with reasoning, then commit to joint allocation under consensus and environment constraints. Each agent independently generates symbolic plans for their roles without revealing detailed trajectories, using a shared dynamic world model.

Result: Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show improved task completion rates and efficiency, with the dynamic world model capturing reusable patterns and enabling evolving collaboration strategies, though with some time overhead.

Conclusion: Symbolic planning enables higher-level operations that are reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable, avoiding brittle step-level alignment while supporting adaptive multi-agent cooperation through negotiation and self-refinement.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with
partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory
level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into
conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of
abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable
synchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized
neurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation
unfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose
candidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under
consensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent
independently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without
revealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a
shared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.
By reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids
brittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are
reusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative
block-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world
model capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and
efficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic
world model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and
self-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient
collaboration strategies.

### [137] [VeriCoT: Neuro-symbolic Chain-of-Thought Validation via Logical Consistency Checks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04662)
*Yu Feng,Nathaniel Weir,Kaj Bostrom,Sam Bayless,Darion Cassel,Sapana Chaudhary,Benjamin Kiesl-Reiter,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VeriCoT is a neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from Chain-of-Thought reasoning in LLMs, enabling automated verification of reasoning validity and improving trust in high-stakes scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought but cannot reliably verify their own logic, even when reaching correct answers, which undermines trust in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order logic, identifies premises that ground arguments in source context, commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps, and uses automated solvers to verify logical validity.

Result: Experiments on ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT effectively identifies flawed reasoning and serves as a strong predictor of final answer correctness. It also enables inference-time self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning, and preference fine-tuning with verification-based rewards.

Conclusion: VeriCoT improves reasoning validity and accuracy by providing verification signals that can be leveraged for various fine-tuning approaches, addressing the fundamental trust issue in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: LLMs can perform multi-step reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but
they cannot reliably verify their own logic. Even when they reach correct
answers, the underlying reasoning may be flawed, undermining trust in
high-stakes scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VeriCoT, a
neuro-symbolic method that extracts and verifies formal logical arguments from
CoT reasoning. VeriCoT formalizes each CoT reasoning step into first-order
logic and identifies premises that ground the argument in source context,
commonsense knowledge, or prior reasoning steps. The symbolic representation
enables automated solvers to verify logical validity while the NL premises
allow humans and systems to identify ungrounded or fallacious reasoning steps.
Experiments on the ProofWriter, LegalBench, and BioASQ datasets show VeriCoT
effectively identifies flawed reasoning, and serves as a strong predictor of
final answer correctness. We also leverage VeriCoT's verification signal for
(1) inference-time self-reflection, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
VeriCoT-distilled datasets and (3) preference fine-tuning (PFT) with direct
preference optimization (DPO) using verification-based pairwise rewards,
further improving reasoning validity and accuracy.
