*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth enable efficient and high-accuracy cropland mapping in Togo, simplifying workflows for land use change assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate land cover maps are crucial for understanding land use change as a climate change driver, but current methods using geospatial embeddings remain underexplored in real-world applications.

Method: Used geospatial embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth to produce cropland maps for Togo.

Result: Geospatial embeddings achieved high-accuracy cropland classification and simplified mapping workflows.

Conclusion: Geospatial embeddings can effectively support better assessments of land use change and its climate impacts through efficient cropland mapping.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative hints is a training method that enforces known invariances across the entire input space using generative models to create virtual examples, outperforming standard data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation alone doesn't fully capture invariant properties since it only learns from transformations of training data, leaving gaps in learning spatial and other invariances across the complete input space.

Method: Leverage generative models trained on the dataset to approximate input distribution and generate unlabeled virtual examples, then train models in semi-supervised manner using both classification and hint objectives on these virtual examples to enforce functional properties.

Result: Consistently outperforms standard data augmentation across datasets, architectures, and loss functions; achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement on fine-grained visual classification benchmarks (0.63% average) and 1.286% average boost on CheXpert X-ray dataset.

Conclusion: Generative hints effectively enforce known invariances throughout the input space, providing superior performance over data augmentation alone by leveraging generative models to create comprehensive training guidance.

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E is a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for ecology that learns to infer missing modalities through masked reconstruction, supports modality inversion, and enables cross-modal retrieval with mixed similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible multimodal model for ecology that can handle any-to-any generation of representations, analyze modality fusion feasibility, and improve cross-modal retrieval performance.

Method: Uses masked modality reconstruction in embedding space to learn inference of missing modalities from context modalities, with probabilistic modeling to analyze fusion feasibility and cross-modal retrieval with mixed inter-modal and intra-modal similarities.

Result: Achieves superior performance across all retrieval tasks and demonstrates strong representation learning capability through linear probing tasks.

Conclusion: ProM3E provides an effective probabilistic framework for multimodal representation learning in ecology with applications in cross-modal retrieval and modality analysis, with all code and datasets being publicly released.

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV - A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV is a large-scale event camera dataset curated from YouTube footage with over 13B events across various environments, enabling self-supervised depth estimation without frame-based annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer HDR and low latency advantages for depth estimation, but existing approaches are limited by small-scale annotated datasets that restrict generalizability to real-world scenarios.

Method: Introduces EvtSlowTV dataset from YouTube footage, uses self-supervised learning framework that capitalizes on HDR potential of raw event streams without frame-based annotations, preserving asynchronous nature of event data.

Result: EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, containing diverse environmental conditions and motions. Training with this dataset enhances model's ability to generalize to complex scenes and motions.

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV bridges the gap in event-based depth estimation by providing large-scale, naturalistic data that enables robust self-supervised learning and improves generalization to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new hybrid CNN-ViT neural architecture search space is proposed to find efficient architectures for tinyML deployment, outperforming ResNet-based models in accuracy and speed under size constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid CNN-ViT architectures are too large and computationally expensive for tinyML deployment, creating a need for efficient hybrid models that can operate under tight resource constraints.

Method: Developed a hybrid CNN-ViT search space for NAS that includes hybrid CNN and ViT blocks for local/global information learning, plus novel searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.

Result: On CIFAR10 dataset, the proposed search space generated hybrid architectures that achieved superior accuracy and inference speed compared to ResNet-based tinyML models while maintaining tight model size constraints.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-ViT NAS search space successfully enables discovery of efficient architectures suitable for tinyML deployment, demonstrating better performance than traditional ResNet approaches under resource limitations.

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP is a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework for volumetric medical imaging that integrates volumetric spatial semantics and domain-aware knowledge to achieve superior cross-task and cross-domain performance in CT analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most vision-language models are limited to 2D data and binary supervision, overlooking continuous and structured dependencies in volumetric data like CT scans, and existing approaches treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising spatial coherence and underutilizing clinical semantics.

Method: Proposes SCALE-VLP framework that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g., radiological ontologies) to guide alignment, using soft-weighted contrastive pre-training under limited supervision.

Result: Achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval, improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Shows consistent gains in zero-shot evaluation on out-of-domain external datasets.

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP demonstrates strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation, classification) and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains without fine-tuning, indicating superior generalization ability for volumetric medical imaging analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A label-efficient approach using self-supervised learning for statewide 1-m land cover classification achieves 87.14% accuracy with only 1,000 annotated patches, addressing the data collection barrier in high-resolution mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of collecting large volumes of training data for deep learning semantic segmentation in high-resolution land cover classification, enabling widespread adoption for meter-scale mapping over large areas.

Method: Used BYOL self-supervised pre-training with 377,921 unlabeled color-infrared aerial patches, then transferred ResNet-101 encoder weights to multiple segmentation architectures (FCN, U-Net, etc.) and fine-tuned with small datasets (250-750 patches) using cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 87.14% overall accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of U-Net models for 8-class land cover mapping over Mississippi, covering 123+ billion pixels. Accurate for water and forest, but challenging for cropland/herbaceous/barren distinctions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning effectively reduces the need for large manually annotated datasets, addressing a major limitation in high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation model for brain MRI that handles different combinations of imaging sequences using learnable modality embeddings and masked autoencoding, enabling adaptation to missing or unseen modalities without needing separate models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified brain MRI model that can work with various modality combinations, eliminating the need for separate models for each imaging sequence and enabling robust performance when some sequences are missing.

Method: Uses a single encoder with learnable modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and masked autoencoding objective with variance-covariance regularization. Trained on 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised reconstruction and modality imputation.

Result: Preliminary results show feasible performance on brain tumor and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification under various modality settings. The model adapts effectively to different input combinations.

Conclusion: The proposed foundation model provides a flexible and unified approach for brain MRI analysis that can handle incomplete or varying modality inputs, with promising initial results and planned comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP introduces structural contrastive learning to VLP by modeling relationships between entities in structured graphs, outperforming CLIP on cross-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLP methods treat image-text pairs as isolated examples, ignoring rich relational structures present in domains like e-commerce and social networks. Inspired by human cognitive maps that encode knowledge through relationships.

Method: Integrates structural contrastive loss to align modalities while modeling relationships between neighboring entities in structured graphs. Uses a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset for structured cross-modality supervision.

Result: Consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Relational supervision provides significant value for cross-modal alignment, demonstrating the importance of incorporating structural information in vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a learning-based framework for evaluating uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds without requiring ground truth, using geometric features to predict point-level uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground truth acquisition for uncertainty evaluation in MLS point clouds is costly and often infeasible in real-world applications, creating a need for GT-free evaluation methods.

Method: A learning-based framework that integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction, using XGBoost and Random Forest models to predict point-level uncertainty quantified by C2C distance.

Result: The framework is feasible and XGBoost delivers comparable accuracy to Random Forest while being about 3 times faster, showing geometric features can effectively predict uncertainty.

Conclusion: MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, providing a novel learning-based approach to uncertainty evaluation research that reduces reliance on ground truth.

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [ISC-Perception: A Hybrid Computer Vision Dataset for Object Detection in Novel Steel Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03098)
*Miftahur Rahman,Samuel Adebayo,Dorian A. Acevedo-Mejia,David Hester,Daniel McPolin,Karen Rafferty,Debra F. Laefer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception is the first hybrid dataset for detecting Intermeshed Steel Connection components, combining synthetic CAD images, photorealistic game-engine scenes, and real photos to overcome data collection challenges in construction robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable dependable perception for ISC-aware robots by addressing the lack of dedicated image datasets, as collecting photos on active construction sites is logistically difficult and raises safety/privacy concerns.

Method: Created a hybrid dataset blending procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and curated real photographs, enabling fully automatic labeling of synthetic portions while explicitly accounting for all human effort in dataset generation.

Result: Achieved 81.7% reduction in human time (30.5h vs 166.7h for 10,000 images), with detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieving mAP@0.50 of 0.756, substantially outperforming synthetic-only or photorealistic-only models. On a 1,200-frame bench test, achieved mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823.

Conclusion: ISC-Perception successfully bridges the data gap for construction-robotics perception, facilitating rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use.

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [12] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)
*Yiyi Miao,Taoyu Wu,Tong Chen,Sihao Li,Ji Jiang,Youpeng Yang,Angelos Stefanidis,Limin Yu,Jionglong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat is a framework for 3D dental occlusion reconstruction from sparse orthodontic images using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing challenges of limited viewpoints and unknown camera poses through prior-guided initialization, scale-adaptive pruning, and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Orthodontic treatment in telemedicine requires multi-view dental occlusion observation for timely decisions, but conventional 3DGS methods need dense inputs and precise camera poses, while orthodontic cases typically have only three sparse images, making reconstruction challenging.

Method: Uses prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction for point cloud initialization, scale-adaptive pruning for efficiency, and incorporates optical flow as geometric constraint with gradient regularization for enhanced rendering fidelity in sparse scenarios.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases simulating real-world conditions, the method effectively handles sparse inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: DentalSplat successfully addresses the limitations of sparse orthodontic imagery reconstruction and demonstrates practical effectiveness for telemedicine applications in orthodontic treatment.

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [13] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD is a support set free framework for IC defect detection and novel class discovery that leverages image intrinsic priors in SEM images without requiring extensive human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare defects, while clustering-based unsupervised methods exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors.

Method: The framework includes: 1) Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection using learnable normal information extractor and reconstruction residuals, 2) Adaptive binarization for stable subimages, and 3) Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification with soft mask guided attention mechanism.

Result: Validated on a real-world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and 15 defect types, the approach demonstrates robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: IC DefectNCD provides an effective solution for IC defect detection and novel class discovery by leveraging image intrinsic priors, overcoming limitations of supervised and clustering-based methods.

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: \sysname is a system that dramatically accelerates vision-guided physical property reasoning from 10-20 minutes to under 6 seconds through algorithmic and systematic optimizations, achieving 62.9x-287.2x speedup while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable augmented visual cognition by minimizing the latency of vision-guided physical property reasoning, making it practical for real-time applications like smart glasses.

Method: Combines rapid geometric 3D reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding through algorithmic and systematic optimizations.

Result: Reduces end-to-end latency from 10-20 minutes to <6 seconds (62.9x-287.2x speedup) while achieving on-par or better object-level physical property estimation accuracy and superior material segmentation/voxel-level inference than SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: \sysname successfully accelerates physical property reasoning to real-time speeds while maintaining high accuracy, demonstrating robust performance in real-world scenarios like smart glasses applications in cluttered environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

### [15] [Deploying Rapid Damage Assessments from sUAS Imagery for Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03132)
*Thomas Manzini,Priyankari Perali,Robin R. Murphy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First operational AI/ML system for automated building damage assessment using sUAS imagery deployed during federal disasters, addressing data overload issues by processing 415 buildings in 18 minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the data avalanche problem where sUAS teams deliver 47GB-369GB of imagery per day during disasters, overwhelming human analysts and delaying response efforts.

Method: Developed models trained on largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS imagery (21,716 building damage labels) and deployed operationally during Hurricanes Debby and Helene.

Result: Successfully deployed system assessed 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes during disaster responses, establishing first state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment.

Conclusion: This work contributes the first documented operational use of AI/ML for damage assessment during disasters and provides lessons learned for both research and user communities.

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

*Sagar Shrestha,Gopal Sharma,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning-free personalization method for text-to-image diffusion models using hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images, eliminating per-subject optimization while maintaining subject fidelity and prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional subject-specific fine-tuning approaches like DreamBooth are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods still require additional fine-tuning or large backbone models. The authors aim to develop a fine-tuning-free personalization method that overcomes these limitations.

Method: Uses hypernetworks to predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images with an end-to-end training objective stabilized by output regularization. Introduces Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG) to combine compositional strengths of base diffusion model with subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate strong personalization performance, achieving reliable subject fidelity and prompt alignment without per-subject optimization at test time.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, eliminating the need for computationally expensive fine-tuning while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

*Yun-Chen Lin,Jiayuan Huang,Hanyuan Zhang,Sergi Kavtaradze,Matthew J. Clarkson,Mobarak I. Hoque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation framework using SAM2 and Depth Anything V2 encoders with a novel SRFT-GaLore method for efficient fine-tuning, achieving improved performance on liver surgery datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate anatomical structure detection in laparoscopic liver surgery is challenging due to 2D video limitations and depth perception issues. Existing methods struggle with fusing RGB and depth features and efficiently adapting large vision models to surgical domains.

Method: Uses dual encoders (SAM2 for RGB, Depth Anything V2 for depth) with cross-attention fusion. Introduces SRFT-GaLore for efficient fine-tuning by replacing SVD with Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform. Validated on L3D and new LLSD datasets.

Result: Achieves 4.85% improvement in Dice Similarity Coefficient and 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface Distance on L3D dataset compared to D2GPLand. Maintains competitive performance on LLSD dataset, outperforming SAM-based baselines.

Conclusion: The SRFT-GaLore-enhanced dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation in real-time surgical settings with strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical environments.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PitVQA-Anticipation is the first VQA dataset for surgical anticipation, containing 33.5 hours of video and 734K QA pairs across four future prediction tasks. SurgAnt-ViVQA model uses GRU-based temporal encoding and gated cross-attention to outperform baselines in surgical forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VQA systems focus on static frame analysis and lack forward-looking capabilities needed for real-time assistance in endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and workflow changes rapidly.

Method: Proposed SurgAnt-ViVQA model adapts a large language model using GRU Gated Temporal Cross-Attention module. Bidirectional GRU encodes frame dynamics while adaptive gate injects visual context at token level. Parameter efficient fine-tuning customizes language backbone for surgical domain.

Result: SurgAnt-ViVQA outperforms strong image and video baselines on PitVQA-Anticipation and EndoVis datasets. Ablations show temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most gains. Frame budget study reveals 8 frames maximize fluency while 32 frames improve numeric time estimation.

Conclusion: SurgAnt-ViVQA advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation through temporally aware encoding and fine-grained gated cross-attention. PitVQA-Anticipation provides comprehensive benchmark highlighting importance of targeted temporal modeling for future-aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

*Kuei-Chun Kao,Hsu Tzu-Yin,Yunqi Hong,Ruochen Wang,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes QG-CoC, a zero-shot prompting method that addresses MLLMs' limitations in multi-image reasoning by using question-guided chain-of-captions to improve fine-grained perception and information synthesis across multiple images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack fine-grained perception across disparate images and have diminished reasoning capabilities for multiple visual inputs, with existing methods primarily focusing on single-image scenarios, leaving a gap in handling complex multi-image tasks.

Method: Proposes Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a zero-shot prompting approach that handles arbitrary numbers of images by guiding caption generation through questions to better integrate perception and reasoning.

Result: QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across multi-image and single-image benchmarks, showing robust improvements in challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail, evaluated on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: QG-CoC effectively addresses MLLMs' limitations in multi-image reasoning by providing a generalized prompting approach that enhances fine-grained perception and seamless integration of perception with reasoning across multiple images.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MvBody, a multi-view Transformer network that uses 3D body shape scans and self-reported medical data to predict cesarean section risk, achieving 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CS risk prediction models rely on hospital-based parameters unavailable in resource-limited settings, creating a need for affordable, accessible alternatives using general devices.

Method: Developed MvBody - a multi-view Transformer network that integrates 3D optical body scans (31st-38th weeks) with self-reported medical data, enhanced with metric learning for data-scarce environments.

Result: Superior performance compared to existing methods: 84.62% accuracy and 0.724 AUC-ROC on independent test set. Key predictors identified include pre-pregnancy weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS, and body shape (head/shoulders).

Conclusion: 3D body shape analysis combined with basic medical data provides a feasible, affordable approach for CS risk assessment in resource-limited settings, with interpretable predictions using Integrated Gradients.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

*Pengyu Jie,Wanquan Liu,Rui He,Yihui Wen,Deyu Meng,Chenqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCPMix, a method that combines diffusion synthesis with mask-consistent mixing to generate diverse training samples while preserving pixel-level semantics, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance across multiple medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional augmentation methods like sample mixing suffer from soft label ambiguity due to misaligned masks, while diffusion synthesis introduces domain shift and overlooks the structural benefits of mask conditioning. There's a need to combine the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Proposes Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix) that generates synthetic counterparts for real images under the same mask, then mixes only image appearance while using original hard masks for supervision. Also introduces Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) to adaptively adjust mixing strength and loss weights.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017 datasets, with consistent gains over baselines.

Conclusion: Combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, along with adaptive re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation by bridging synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry.

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Motivation: Existing Mamba-based super-resolution methods lack fine-grained transitions across different modeling scales, limiting feature representation efficiency. The authors aim to address this limitation while maintaining linear computational complexity.

Method: The proposed T-PMambaSR integrates window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba to enable interactions among receptive fields of different scales. It also includes an Adaptive High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost during processing.

Result: Extensive experiments show that T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and expressiveness, achieving better performance than recent Transformer- or Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost.

Conclusion: T-PMambaSR establishes a fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature representation with linear complexity, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of early stages providing both low-level fundamental features to deep stages and high-level discriminative features to early-stage predictors simultaneously in large-scale pre-trained model tuning.

Method: Introduces a lightweight bypass module for functional decomposition of shallow features, develops a high-order statistics-based predictor for early stages, and uses decoupled optimization with two-phase loss weights during training.

Result: Experiments across various datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: DMPO effectively decouples representative and discriminative abilities in early stages through both architecture design and model optimization, providing an efficient solution for inference-efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative method for translating between color flow doppler and greyscale ultrasound videos achieves realistic results (SSIM 0.91) and performs indistinguishably from real videos in classification/segmentation tasks and clinical evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance in ultrasound studies where different sub-modalities like greyscale and color flow doppler are often imbalanced, and expand utility of retrospectively collected medical imaging.

Method: Used a generative approach with pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual losses, employing two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging.

Result: Synthetic videos achieved SSIM 0.91±0.04 with ground truth, performed indistinguishably in DL tasks (F1: 0.9 real vs 0.89 synthetic, Dice: 0.97), and clinicians could only distinguish real vs synthetic with 54±6% accuracy.

Conclusion: The method successfully generates realistic ultrasound videos that expand utility of existing imaging data and augment dataset design for medical imaging, demonstrating foundational capabilities across clinical domains.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

*Bingyang Guo,Hongjie Li,Ruiyun Yu,Hanzhe Liang,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IEC3D-AD, a high-fidelity point cloud dataset for industrial equipment component anomaly detection collected from real production lines, and proposes GMANet, a novel 3D anomaly detection method using geometric morphological analysis and spatial discrepancy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D anomaly detection datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec 3D-AD fail to capture the complexities and subtle defects in real industrial environments, limiting precise anomaly detection research for industrial equipment components such as bearings, rings, and bolts.

Method: Developed IEC3D-AD dataset collected from actual production lines with improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity. Proposed GMANet method that generates synthetic point cloud samples using geometric morphological analysis and optimizes spatial discrepancy to reduce margin and increase overlap between normal and abnormal point-level features.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets, showing improved performance in detecting subtle defects in industrial equipment components.

Conclusion: The IEC3D-AD dataset addresses limitations of existing datasets by providing high-fidelity industrial data, and the GMANet method offers an effective 3D anomaly detection paradigm through geometric analysis and spatial optimization, advancing industrial equipment component reliability and safety.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

*Shuangquan Lyu,Steven Mao,Yue Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting using text-to-video diffusion models with LoRA fine-tuning and temporal co-denoising for seamless long video generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of generating long videos and achieving high controllability in video inpainting and outpainting tasks simultaneously.

Method: Leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained video diffusion models for masked region synthesis, and employs overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.

Result: Enables arbitrarily long video generation without noticeable seams or drift, outperforms baseline methods (Wan 2.1 and VACE) in quality metrics (PSNR/SSIM) and perceptual realism (LPIPS).

Conclusion: Achieves practical long-range video editing with minimal overhead, balancing parameter efficiency and superior performance.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

### [29] [Diffusion-SDPO: Safeguarded Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03317)
*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Tianyu Cui,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule for diffusion-based Direct Preference Optimization that prevents degradation of preferred outputs by adaptively scaling loser gradients based on their alignment with winner gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Diffusion-DPO has a pathology where enlarging preference margin can increase reconstruction errors of both winner and loser branches, potentially degrading the preferred outputs even as margin grows.

Method: Proposed Diffusion-SDPO uses a safeguarded update rule that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to its alignment with the winner gradient, with a closed-form scaling coefficient derived from first-order analysis.

Result: Across standard text-to-image benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO is a simple, model-agnostic method that adds minimal computational overhead and effectively addresses the pathology in standard Diffusion-DPO while being compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgViVQA is a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes using a Masked Video-Text Encoder and fine-tuned LLM, outperforming existing models on colonoscopic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical VideoQA approaches are limited to static image features and lack temporal annotations, ignoring critical dynamics needed for accurate procedural interpretation.

Method: Uses a Masked Video-Text Encoder to fuse video and question features capturing temporal cues like motion and tool-tissue interactions, then decodes with a fine-tuned LLM.

Result: Outperforms existing image-based VQA models, improving over PitVQA by +11% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9% on EndoVis18-VQA, with better robustness to question phrasing variations.

Conclusion: SurgViVQA provides a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling more effective interpretation of dynamic procedural contexts.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution to the MOT25-Spatiotemporal Action
Grounding (MOT25-StAG) Challenge. The aim of this challenge is to accurately
localize and track multiple objects that match specific and free-form language
queries, using video data of complex real-world scenes as input. We model the
underlying task as a video retrieval problem and present a two-stage, zero-shot
approach, combining the advantages of the SOTA tracking model FastTracker and
Multi-modal Large Language Model LLaVA-Video. On the MOT25-StAG test set, our

*Guozhen Zhang,Zixiang Zhou,Teng Hu,Ziqiao Peng,Youliang Zhang,Yi Chen,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniAVGen is a unified framework for joint audio-video generation that addresses lip synchronization and semantic consistency issues through dual-branch Diffusion Transformers with asymmetric cross-modal interaction and face-aware modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source audio-video generation methods suffer from compromised lip synchronization and insufficient semantic consistency due to lack of effective cross-modal modeling.

Method: Uses dual-branch joint synthesis architecture with parallel Diffusion Transformers, Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism for bidirectional cross-attention, Face-Aware Modulation module, and Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance during inference.

Result: Achieves overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre consistency, and emotion consistency with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs 30.1M), and enables multiple audio-video tasks within a single model.

Conclusion: UniAVGen provides a robust solution for joint audio-video generation with superior cross-modal synchronization and consistency compared to existing methods, while being more data-efficient.

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

### [33] [Decoupling Augmentation Bias in Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03367)
*Gahyeon Kim,Sohee Kim,Seokju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AAPL introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations, improving prompt learning for zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods like CoOp and CoCoOp struggle with generalization to unseen categories and primarily focus on text-based modifications, leaving image-based augmentation unexplored. These methods lack explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features.

Method: AAPL (Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning) introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations from class-relevant semantic representations. This enables learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with target categories.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets show AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

Conclusion: AAPL effectively addresses limitations in existing prompt learning methods by leveraging image-level augmentations with adversarial token embeddings, leading to improved generalization and performance across various learning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated method using PCA and multiple selection strategies to standardize embryo alignment in 3D ultrasound images, achieving high accuracy (98.5%) for first-trimester prenatal analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardized alignment of embryos in 3D ultrasound images facilitates prenatal growth monitoring by enabling standard plane detection, improving landmark visualization, and accentuating differences between scans.

Method: PCA is applied to embryo segmentation masks to extract principal axes, generating four candidate orientations. Three selection strategies are used: Pearson correlation heuristic, atlas-based image matching via normalized cross-correlation, and Random Forest classifier.

Result: Tested on 2166 3D ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies (7+0 to 12+6 weeks GA). PCA correctly extracted principal axes in 99.0% of images. Selection accuracy: Pearson Heuristic 97.4%, Atlas-based 95.8%, Random Forest 98.4%. Majority Vote achieved 98.5% accuracy.

Conclusion: The high-accuracy pipeline enables consistent embryonic alignment in first trimester, supporting scalable analysis in clinical and research settings. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

*Kevin Manogue,Tomasz M Schang,Dilara Kuş,Jonas Müller,Stefan Zachow,Agniva Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Shape-from-Template method that handles topological changes like tears and cuts by iteratively adapting the template through spatial domain partitioning to maintain physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Shape-from-Template methods fail when topological changes occur during deformation, limiting their practical application to real-world scenarios where objects can tear or be cut.

Method: Initialize with classical SfT solution, then iteratively adapt the template by partitioning its spatial domain to minimize an energy functional combining physical plausibility and reprojection consistency.

Result: Robustly captures various topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces, outperforming baseline methods on both synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: Establishes the first general framework for topological-change-aware Shape-from-Template, enabling reconstruction of deformable objects even when topological changes occur.

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Anny is a scan-free, differentiable human body model based on anthropometric knowledge that provides interpretable shape control across diverse demographics, calibrated with WHO statistics, and supports various 3D human modeling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric body models rely on costly 3D scans and proprietary shape spaces that are demographically narrow, creating accessibility and representation limitations.

Method: Anny defines a continuous, interpretable shape space using anthropometric knowledge from MakeHuman, with phenotype parameters controlling blendshapes across ages, body types, and proportions, calibrated with WHO population statistics.

Result: Anny enables millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery. Anny-One dataset of 800k photorealistic humans shows HMR models trained with Anny match scan-based model performance while being interpretable and broadly representative.

Conclusion: Anny provides an accessible, open-source foundation for human-centric 3D modeling with realistic demographic variation, released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for

*Vittal L. Rao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes signal intensity-weighted coordinate representation that scales coordinate channels by local signal intensity, improving localization performance in biomedical data across ECG signals and cytological images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization tasks in biomedical data require learning spatial/temporal relationships from signals with complex intensity distributions. Existing approaches like CoordConv use pure coordinate channels, but lack intensity-position coupling.

Method: Replace pure coordinate channels with intensity-weighted coordinate channels that scale coordinates by local signal intensity, creating an intensity-position coupling in the input representation.

Result: Faster convergence and higher generalization performance on both ECG signal transition time prediction and nuclear center coordinate regression in cytological images, outperforming conventional coordinate-channel approaches.

Conclusion: The intensity-weighted coordinate representation provides an effective modality-agnostic inductive bias that improves localization performance across 1D and 2D biomedical signals.

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Francis Fowley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight 3DCNN for human activity recognition using event-based vision data that preserves privacy while achieving high accuracy (94.17%) and outperforming benchmark models by up to 3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as conventional cameras capture identifiable information, while event cameras only record pixel intensity changes, providing inherent privacy protection.

Method: Proposed a lightweight 3DCNN that models spatial and temporal dynamics, using focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation to address class imbalance and enhance generalization.

Result: Achieved F1-score of 0.9415 and overall accuracy of 94.17% on composite dataset from Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets, outperforming C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3%.

Conclusion: Event-based deep learning shows potential for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human

*Dongkeun Kim,Minsu Cho,Suha Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A part-aware bottom-up framework for fine-grained social interaction detection that uses body part features and interpersonal relations to infer social groups and interactions, outperforming prior methods on the NVI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing social interaction detection methods overlook subtle cues like facial expressions and gestures, relying instead on holistic representations and directly detecting groups without modeling underlying interactions, which limits their ability to capture localized social signals.

Method: The proposed method first detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, then infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based reasoning that considers both spatial relations and subtle social cues signaling interactions.

Result: Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that the method outperforms prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in social interaction detection.

Conclusion: The part-aware bottom-up group reasoning framework effectively captures fine-grained social interactions by leveraging body part features and interpersonal relations, leading to more accurate group inference compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

*Jongseo Lee,Wooil Lee,Gyeong-Moon Park,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANCE is a video action recognition framework that disentangles explanations into motion dynamics, objects, and scenes concepts for clearer interpretability while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video action recognition explanation methods produce entangled explanations that fail to distinguish between motion and spatial context, while language-based approaches struggle to explain tacit motions that are hard to verbalize.

Method: Proposes a concept-based framework with three disentangled concept types: motion dynamics (human pose sequences), objects, and scenes. Uses large language models to automatically extract object and scene concepts, and employs ante-hoc concept bottleneck design to enforce prediction through these concepts.

Result: Experiments on KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101 datasets show DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with competitive performance. User study validates superior interpretability, and the framework proves beneficial for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

Conclusion: DANCE successfully addresses the disentanglement challenge in video action recognition explanations by separating motion dynamics from spatial context, providing clearer interpretability while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

### [41] [Cache Mechanism for Agent RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02919)
*Shuhang Lin,Zhencan Peng,Lingyao Li,Xiao Lin,Xi Zhu,Yongfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC is a novel caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for LLM agents, reducing storage to 0.015% of original size while maintaining high retrieval performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems lack efficient agent-level cache management for constructing, maintaining, and updating compact, relevant corpora dynamically tailored to each agent's needs.

Method: ARC synthesizes historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in embedding space to automatically maintain a high-relevance cache without requiring annotations.

Result: ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of original corpus, achieves up to 79.8% has-answer rate, and reduces average retrieval latency by 80% across three retrieval datasets.

Conclusion: ARC drastically enhances both efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents by providing dynamic, compact cache management.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been
propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models
access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving
agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing,
maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to
each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent
RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that
dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing
historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached
items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance
cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our
experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to
0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and
reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can
drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

### [42] [Automatic Machine Translation Detection Using a Surrogate Multilingual Translation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02958)
*Cristian García-Romero,Miquel Esplà-Gomis,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes using internal representations from multilingual MT models to detect machine-translated text, achieving 5+ percentage point accuracy gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern MT systems rely on large parallel corpora from the internet, but much content is machine-generated, and overreliance on synthetic data degrades translation quality, making filtering essential.

Method: Uses internal representations from a surrogate multilingual MT model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, with at least 5 percentage point accuracy gains.

Conclusion: The approach effectively identifies machine-translated content and is crucial for building high-quality MT systems by filtering synthetic data.

Abstract: Modern machine translation (MT) systems depend on large parallel corpora,
often collected from the Internet. However, recent evidence indicates that (i)
a substantial portion of these texts are machine-generated translations, and
(ii) an overreliance on such synthetic content in training data can
significantly degrade translation quality. As a result, filtering out non-human
translations is becoming an essential pre-processing step in building
high-quality MT systems. In this work, we propose a novel approach that
directly exploits the internal representations of a surrogate multilingual MT
model to distinguish between human and machine-translated sentences.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
techniques, particularly for non-English language pairs, achieving gains of at
least 5 percentage points of accuracy.

### [43] [LEGO-Eval: Towards Fine-Grained Evaluation on Synthesizing 3D Embodied Environments with Tool Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03001)
*Gyeom Hwangbo,Hyungjoo Chae,Minseok Kang,Hyeonjong Ju,Soohyun Oh,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEGO-Eval is a new evaluation framework that outperforms existing methods in assessing alignment between fine-grained instructions and generated 3D scenes, revealing that current generation methods achieve only up to 10% success rate in creating fully aligned scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene generation methods often produce unrealistic scenes due to coarse-grained instructions, which can lead embodied agents to learn incorrect priors that degrade real-world performance. Existing evaluation methods like CLIPScore and VLMs fail to reliably assess alignment between instructions and generated scenes.

Method: The authors introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components for accurate alignment assessment. They also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions specifying complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments.

Result: LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench shows current generation methods achieve at most 10% success rate in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

Conclusion: The proposed LEGO-Eval framework provides more reliable assessment of 3D scene-instruction alignment, revealing significant limitations in current generation methods and highlighting the need for improved approaches that can better handle fine-grained instructions.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic
spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this
problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,
advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions
that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic
scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to
learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,
degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment
between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for
effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and
vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.
This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D
scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address
this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse
tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate
alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed
instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world
environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge
by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with
LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.
Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in
generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARF pipeline enables smaller open-source LLMs to outperform larger proprietary models in customer service summarization through error analysis, targeted revision, and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cost efficiency and data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy in customer service summarization tasks using smaller open-source models.

Method: Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline: analyzes errors from teacher model (GPT-3.5), revises using compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B), and fine-tunes student model (Llama 3.1 8B) on refined data.

Result: Fine-tuned smaller student model (Llama 3.1 8B) achieved superior summarization performance compared to GPT-3.5.

Conclusion: ARF pipeline provides a generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse downstream applications while improving cost efficiency and data privacy.

Abstract: We introduce an Analyze-Revise-Finetune (ARF) pipeline that enables smaller
open-source language models (LLMs) to surpass substantially larger proprietary
models in customer service summarization tasks. The pipeline first analyzes and
categorizes common errors in summaries produced by a teacher model (GPT-3.5),
then performs a targeted revision using a compact editor model (Llama 3.1 70B)
to generate high-quality, refined training data. Fine-tuning a smaller student
model (Llama 3.1 8B) on this refined data resulted in superior summarization
performance compared to GPT-3.5. The ARF pipeline improves cost efficiency and
data privacy while maintaining competitive accuracy, illustrating a
generalizable framework for enhancing open-source LLMs across diverse
downstream applications.

### [45] [Data-Efficient Adaptation and a Novel Evaluation Method for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03034)
*Yan Cathy Hua,Paul Denny,Jörg Wicker,Katerina Taškova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for low-resource domains by proposing a flexible evaluation method (FTS-OBP), studying small language models' performance in education reviews, and releasing the first public education review ABSA dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ABSA research is concentrated in commercial domains, leaving high-demand areas like education and healthcare underserved. Domain adaptation challenges and rigid evaluation methods hinder progress in these low-resource domains.

Method: Proposed FTS-OBP evaluation method for flexible boundary matching; studied small decoder-only generative language models (<7B parameters) using data-free (in-context learning, weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods; introduced multitask fine-tuning strategy; released education review ABSA resources.

Result: Small language models (1.5-3.8B parameters) surpassed proprietary large models and approached benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU using the proposed multitask fine-tuning strategy.

Conclusion: The work enables effective ABSA in low-resource domains through flexible evaluation, efficient small model deployment, and resource sharing, demonstrating that small models can achieve competitive performance with minimal data and computational resources.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROBOTO2 is an open-source web platform that uses large language models to automate risk of bias assessment in clinical trials, combining PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented prompting, and human review to streamline the traditionally manual ROB2 annotation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Risk of bias assessment in clinical trials is traditionally labor-intensive and time-consuming. The motivation is to automate and streamline the ROB2 annotation process using LLM assistance while maintaining human oversight through an interactive interface.

Method: ROBOTO2 uses a web-based platform with PDF parsing, retrieval-augmented LLM prompting, and human-in-the-loop review.

The authors benchmarked ROB2 performance for 4 LLMs and analyzed current model capabilities and challenges in automating systematic review assessments.

Conclusion: ROBOTO2 successfully demonstrates the potential of LLM-assisted risk of bias assessment while highlighting ongoing challenges in fully automating this critical systematic review component. The open-source release enables reproducibility and future research in this domain.

Abstract: We present ROBOTO2, an open-source, web-based platform for large language
model (LLM)-assisted risk of bias (ROB) assessment of clinical trials. ROBOTO2

*Victoria Ebert,Rishabh Singh,Tuochao Chen,Noah A. Smith,Shyamnath Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the one-sided conversation problem (1SC) where only one side of a dialogue is available, and studies two tasks: reconstructing missing speaker turns and generating summaries from one-sided transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational AI faces limitations in real-world scenarios where only one side of conversations can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and smart glasses applications.

Method: Used prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor datasets, evaluated with human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics. Techniques included using one future turn, utterance length information, and placeholder prompting to mitigate hallucination.

Result: Found that access to one future turn and utterance length information improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps reduce hallucination, large models generate good reconstructions with prompting while smaller models need finetuning, and high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns.

Conclusion: Presents 1SC as a novel challenge and reports promising results that advance privacy-aware conversational AI.

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one
side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and
smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC):
inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1)
reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)
generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and
finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B
testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and
information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder
prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate
promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.
Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing
turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that
mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

TL;DR: PolyNorm is a prompt-based text normalization approach using LLMs that reduces manual engineering and improves multilingual coverage, achieving lower word error rates across 8 languages compared to traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text normalization systems require substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges for language coverage, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Proposed PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) with a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation.

Result: Experiments across eight languages showed consistent reductions in word error rate (WER) compared to a production-grade system.

Conclusion: PolyNorm reduces reliance on manually crafted rules, enables broader linguistic applicability with minimal human intervention, and the authors release PolyNorm-Benchmark dataset to support further research.

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents.
Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial
engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language
coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a
prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to
reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic
applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a
language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed
to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments
across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER)
compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we
release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of
text normalization phenomena.

*Gowtham Premananth,Carol Espy-Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study analyzes language disruptions in schizophrenia using computational linguistic measures (surprisal and semantic coherence) to differentiate patients from healthy controls and assess symptom severity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language disruptions in schizophrenia reflect cognitive disturbances and could serve as objective markers for diagnosis and symptom severity assessment.

Method: Computing surprisal and semantic coherence using computational models to compare language production between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

Result: The study found differences in surprisal and semantic coherence measures between schizophrenia subjects and healthy controls, with these linguistic measures changing according to symptom severity.

Conclusion: Computational linguistic measures like surprisal and semantic coherence can characterize language disruptions in schizophrenia and may serve as objective markers for diagnosis and symptom severity assessment.

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired
discourse coherence. These abnormalities in spontaneous language production
reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

TL;DR: CARMA is the first large-scale automatically annotated Arabic Reddit dataset for mental health detection, covering six conditions and outperforming existing resources in scale and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in Arabic mental health detection due to limited resources, cultural stigma, and scarcity of annotated datasets, while most research focuses on English.

Method: Created CARMA dataset from Arabic Reddit posts with automatic annotation for six mental health conditions and control group. Conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses of linguistic markers, and performed classification experiments using various models from shallow classifiers to large language models.

Result: CARMA dataset surpasses existing resources in scale and diversity. Classification experiments demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for mental health detection, showing promise for advancing detection in underrepresented languages like Arabic.

Conclusion: The CARMA dataset enables significant progress in Arabic mental health detection by providing the first large-scale annotated resource, with results highlighting the potential for improving detection in underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection
remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where
resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to
cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language
mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due
to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first
automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset
encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and
Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both
scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of
lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the
linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the
dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform
classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to
large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental
health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

TL;DR: A control-based framework using control barrier functions (CBF) to align LLMs by filtering generated tokens to ensure user-desirable text without fine-tuning the baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure large language models generate user-desirable text through a safety intervention mechanism that doesn't require retraining the base model.

Method: Apply control barrier function safety filter to predicted tokens from baseline LLM, using an add-on approach that can directly incorporate evaluation models for alignment.

Result: Implemented with open-source language models to generate positive text, demonstrating the framework's practical application.

Conclusion: The CBF-based safety filter provides an effective add-on solution for LLM alignment that preserves baseline model functionality while ensuring desirable text generation.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language
models (LLMs) by leveraging a control barrier function (CBF) to ensure
user-desirable text generation. The presented framework applies the CBF safety
filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in
the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this
safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes
without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model
regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter
design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source
language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-CC is a vision-grounded benchmark that evaluates multimodal large language models' cognitive capacity across 11 reasoning tasks in spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based categories, revealing current limitations and common error patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal benchmarks either overemphasize textual reasoning or fail to systematically assess vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving MLLMs' cognitive capacity insufficiently evaluated.

Method: Developed MME-CC benchmark with 11 reasoning tasks organized into spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based reasoning categories, then conducted extensive experiments on 16 representative MLLMs.

Result: Closed-source models lead overall (Gemini-2.5-Pro: 42.66 vs GLM-4.5V: 30.45), but spatial and geometric reasoning remain weak (≤30%). Identified common error patterns including orientation mistakes, fragile identity persistence, and poor counterfactual adherence.

Conclusion: The work aims to catalyze treating cognitive capacity as central to MLLM evaluation and design, revealing significant gaps in vision-centric reasoning that need addressing.

Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in
human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe
vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either
overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing
vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs
insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC
(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded
benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three
fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and
knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'
cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct
extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that
closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.
30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak
(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,
including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and
poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that
Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->
verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a
shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both
evaluation and model design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is essential for responsible deployment, requiring stakeholder-grounded risk assessment to enhance transparency and alignment with human-centered AI governance.

Method: Uses LLMs as judges with Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method to generate stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies, demonstrated through three real-world AI use cases (medical AI, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection) with interactive visualization.

Result: Stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and conflict patterns, revealing how different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the importance of stakeholder-aware explanations to make LLM-based evaluations more transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance goals.

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict
and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our
framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.

*Kevin Wang,Subre Abdoul Moktar,Jia Li,Kangshuo Li,Feng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive empirical study comparing 12 uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs in QA tasks, evaluating their performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets using 4 generation quality metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more pervasive across industries, ensuring the trustworthiness of their outputs is crucial, where uncertainty estimation plays a key role in evaluating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Method: The study involves twelve different UE methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM criticizers to evaluate uncertainty in LLM-generated answers in Question-Answering tasks on both ID and OOD datasets.

Result: Information-based methods perform exceptionally well in ID settings, while density-based methods and P(True) metric show superior performance in OOD contexts. Semantic consistency methods demonstrate reliable performance across different datasets and generation metrics.

Conclusion: Different uncertainty estimation methods excel in different contexts: information-based methods are optimal for ID settings, density-based methods for OOD scenarios, and semantic consistency methods provide reliable general performance across various conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding
applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the
trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)
plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to
examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE
methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM
criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based
methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally
well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of
the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit
superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in
capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods,
which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across
different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well
but may not be optimal for every situation.

Motivation: Multilingual LLMs are gaining traction in South Asia but their alignment with local ethical norms for Bengali (spoken by 285M people) remains underexplored, as existing ethics benchmarks are English-centric and shaped by Western frameworks.

Method: Created BengaliMoralBench covering five moral domains (Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting, Family Relationships, Religious Activities) with 50 culturally relevant subtopics, annotated via native-speaker consensus using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics.

Result: Systematic zero-shot evaluation of multilingual LLMs (Llama, Gemma, Qwen, DeepSeek) showed wide performance variation (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense reasoning, and moral fairness.

Conclusion: BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual settings like Bangladesh.

Abstract: As multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across South Asia,
their alignment with local ethical norms, particularly for Bengali, which is
spoken by over 285 million people and ranked 6th globally, remains
underexplored. Existing ethics benchmarks are largely English-centric and
shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for
real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the
first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural
contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,
Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally
relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus
using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct
systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including
Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and
standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative
analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense
reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for
responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting
the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual
settings such as Bangladesh.

### [56] [LGM: Enhancing Large Language Models with Conceptual Meta-Relations and Iterative Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03214)
*Wenchang Lei,Ping Zou,Yue Wang,Feng Sun,Lei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Language Graph Model (LGM) enhances LLMs' conceptual understanding by extracting meta-relations from text and using a reflection mechanism for validation, enabling processing of texts of any length without truncation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with ambiguous or conceptually misaligned terms in user instructions, requiring better methods for conceptual clarity.

Method: Extracts meta-relations (inheritance, alias, composition) from natural language, employs reflection mechanism for validation, and uses Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm to dynamically supply relations to LLM.

Result: Outperforms existing RAG baselines on standard benchmarks and enables processing of texts of any length without truncation.

Conclusion: LGM effectively enhances LLMs' ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses by improving conceptual clarity through meta-relation extraction and validation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet
struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned
terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity
by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural
language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these
meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these
relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,
improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.
Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely
on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to
process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing
RAG baselines.

*Shaghayegh Kolli,Richard Rosenbaum,Timo Cavelius,Lasse Strothe,Andrii Lata,Jana Diesner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid fact-checking system combining LLMs, knowledge graphs, and web search agents achieves high accuracy on FEVER benchmark without task-specific fine-tuning, with modular architecture and fallback strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs (lack of reliable grounding) and knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers (limited coverage/latency) by integrating their complementary strengths.

Method: Three-step pipeline: 1) KG retrieval from DBpedia for rapid lookups, 2) LM-based classification with task-specific prompts, 3) Web search agent as fallback when KG coverage is insufficient.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.93 on FEVER benchmark's Supported/Refuted split; successfully identifies valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information.

Conclusion: Presents a modular, open-source fact-checking pipeline with robust fallback strategies and generalization capabilities across datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can
lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time,
knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence,
yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge
graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking
approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system
comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid
one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a
task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based
logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.
Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the
Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not
enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that
our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled
as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM
reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking
pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

### [59] [IndicSuperTokenizer: An Optimized Tokenizer for Indic Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03237)
*Souvik Rana,Arul Menezes,Ashish Kulkarni,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IndicSuperTokenizer is a new multilingual tokenizer for Indian languages that combines subword and multi-word tokenization with language-specific pre-tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art fertility scores and 44% inference throughput improvement over LLaMA4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subword tokenization methods like BPE are underexplored for multilingual settings, particularly for Indic languages with diverse scripts and rich morphological variation, creating challenges for effective tokenizer design.

Method: Combines subword and multi-word tokenization with language-specific pre-tokenization to create more linguistically aligned tokens. Includes detailed ablations across training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and pre-tokenization strategies.

Result: Achieves 39.5% improvement in average fertility score over LLaMA4 and 18% over Sutra (current best). Provides 44% improvement in inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on English and Indic benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed tokenizer design is robust and effective for multilingual LLMs, particularly for Indic languages, demonstrating significant improvements in both tokenization quality and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training
efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing
effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to
diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in
multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a
tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and
multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading
to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in
fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data,
our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by
18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in
inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on
English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across
tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and
pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design
choices.

*Ranul Dayarathne,Uvini Ranaweera,Upeksha Ganegoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study compares the performance of five LLMs (GPT-3.5, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct, and Orca-mini-v3-7b) on question-answering tasks using RAG in computer science literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the performance of different LLMs in question-answering tasks across diverse domains using RAG to reduce hallucination and enhance model capabilities.

Method: Used RAG support for QA tasks in computer science literature, evaluated using accuracy, precision for binary questions, human expert ranking, Google Gemini ranking, and cosine similarity for long-answer questions.

Result: GPT-3.5 with RAG performed best overall, while Mistral-7b-instruct was the top open-source model for both binary and long-answer questions. Orca-mini-v3-7b had the shortest latency, while LLaMa2-7b-chat had the highest.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs can compete with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 when paired with better infrastructure, demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG in enhancing LLM performance across different model types.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to
enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.
Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in
question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance
of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,
Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA
tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation
metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary
questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,
alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired
with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its
status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's
Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary
and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b
reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas
LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research
underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with
proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

### [61] [SCALE: Upscaled Continual Learning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03270)
*Jin-woo Lee,Junhwa Choi,Bongkyu Hwang,Jinho Choo,Bogun Kim,JeongSeon Yi,Joonseok Lee,DongYoung Jung,Jaeseon Park,Kyoungwon Park,Suk-hoon Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCALE is a width upscaling architecture for continual pre-training that inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing pre-trained parameters, preserving original functionality while increasing capacity through preservation and adaptation principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in continual pre-training depends more on scaling the right structure than just scaling parameters, and current approaches suffer from forgetting issues when expanding model capacity.

Method: SCALE uses width upscaling with lightweight expansion in linear modules, freezing pre-trained weights, and offers three variants: SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and SCALE-Route with token-level routing between preservation and adaptation heads.

Result: SCALE mitigates severe forgetting observed with depth expansion while acquiring new knowledge, achieves less forgetting on English evaluations and competitive gains on Korean benchmarks in continual pre-training, offering the best stability-plasticity trade-off.

Conclusion: SCALE provides an effective approach for continual pre-training that preserves base model functionality while enabling knowledge acquisition, with analysis showing when preservation holds and why the preservation-adaptation interplay stabilizes optimization.

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that
progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling
parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that
inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all
pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies
and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original
functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,
which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented
initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative
Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to
acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as
SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and
SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing
between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography
benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion
while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean
corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and
competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best
overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when
preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and
adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning
setups.

### [62] [How to Evaluate Speech Translation with Source-Aware Neural MT Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03295)
*Mauro Cettolo,Marco Gaido,Matteo Negri,Sara Papi,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces source-aware metrics for speech-to-text translation evaluation using ASR transcripts and back-translations as synthetic sources, with a novel cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ST evaluation relies on reference-based metrics that ignore source audio information, while source-aware metrics in MT show better correlation with human judgments. However, extending this to ST is challenging due to audio sources and lack of reliable transcripts.

Method: Two strategies for generating textual proxies: ASR transcripts and back-translations of reference translations, plus a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to handle alignment mismatches between synthetic sources and references.

Result: Experiments on 79 language pairs and 6 ST systems show ASR transcripts are more reliable when WER < 20%, while back-translations are computationally cheaper but still effective. The re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation.

Conclusion: Source-aware metrics with synthetic sources and cross-lingual re-segmentation provide more accurate ST evaluation, paving the way for improved evaluation methodologies in speech translation.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically
performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference
translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the
limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from
the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that
neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with
human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the
source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments
between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct
the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular
focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not
available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual
proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and
back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch
between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried
out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with
diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts
constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word
error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a
computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT
metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled
evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of reasoning MLLMs (Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash) in clinical tasks shows marginal performance improvement from thinking mode compared to standard mode, with suboptimal results on complex medical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate how enhanced reasoning processes in dual-state MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks, given the rapid adoption of these reasoning-capable models.

Method: Assessed performance of two leading MLLMs (Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash) on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets, comparing thinking mode versus standard non-thinking mode.

Result: The improvement from activating thinking mode remained marginal compared to standard non-thinking mode for most tasks. Performance on complex medical tasks like open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remained suboptimal.

Conclusion: Current reasoning MLLMs show limited benefits from thinking mode in medical applications, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.

TL;DR: This review systematically evaluates the transformative impact of Generative AI (GenAI) in bioinformatics across genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery, identifying six key research areas where GenAI demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically identify and evaluate the growing developments of Generative AI in bioinformatics, assessing its methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization across various biological domains.

Method: The review proposed six research questions (RQs) following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods, evaluating GenAI strategies across sequence analysis, molecular design, integrative data modeling, and specialized model architectures.

Result: GenAI demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods through pattern recognition and output generation, with specialized model architectures outperforming general-purpose models. Significant benefits were identified in molecular analysis, data integration, structural modeling, functional prediction, and synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks.

Conclusion: While GenAI shows transformative potential in bioinformatics with improved accuracy and reduced errors, constraints include scalability issues and data biases affecting generalizability. Future directions should focus on robust evaluation, biologically grounded modeling, and leveraging diverse datasets from molecular, cellular, and textual resources for training and generalization.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

*Rom Himelstein,Amit LeVi,Brit Youngmann,Yaniv Nemcovsky,Avi Mendelson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB) to uncover hidden biases in safety-aligned LLMs that are masked by refusal responses, using activation steering to reveal underlying unfair preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness evaluation methods for LLMs often misinterpret refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, creating a false sense of fairness and overlooking deeper biased preferences encoded in the models' latent space.

Method: Proposes SBB using activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA evaluation, allowing detection of silenced biases without relying on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries that risk introducing additional biases.

Result: Demonstrated on multiple LLMs, revealing an alarming distinction between models' direct refusal responses and their underlying fairness issues, exposing biases that were effectively concealed by safety-alignment.

Conclusion: SBB provides a scalable fairness evaluation framework that can expand to new demographic groups and subjects, encouraging development of fair models beyond the masking effects of alignment training.

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly
widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential
and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness
of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize
standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook
deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive
fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,
we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences
encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by
safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases
often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which
present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with
additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to
uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals
during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,
presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future
development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment
training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings
expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their
underlying fairness issues.

*Yunbo Long,Yuhan Liu,Alexandra Brintrup*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EQ-Negotiator enables small language models to match or exceed large language models in automated credit negotiations by using emotional personas and a reasoning system that combines game theory with Hidden Markov Models to track debtor emotional states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are computationally expensive and privacy-invasive for on-device applications, while small language models have a performance gap in handling emotionally charged negotiation scenarios, creating a need for privacy-preserving yet effective negotiation systems.

Method: Developed EQ-Negotiator framework with a reasoning system integrating game theory and Hidden Markov Model to learn and track debtor emotional states online without pre-training, enabling SLMs to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict.

Result: A 7B parameter model with EQ-Negotiator achieved better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times larger across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial strategies like cheating and threatening.

Conclusion: Strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical success factor in automated negotiation, enabling effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on edge devices.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has
set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy
requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device
applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client
interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,
they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing
emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This
paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability
gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates
game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional
states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs
with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating
conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent
simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial
debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show
that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt
recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its
size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles
to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.
Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw
model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,
paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators
that can operate on the edge.

*Shenghao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LFC-DA is a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline for logical data augmentation that maps text to propositional expressions, compiles a rule library, and systematically generates diverse, logically rigorous natural-language questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for complex logical data augmentation either rely heavily on costly human annotation or use large language models that produce uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples, creating a need for more systematic and rigorous methods.

Method: The LFC-DA pipeline first maps logical text to propositional expressions, compiles a compact rule library, then performs bounded state-space search to systematically discover valid formulas, which are finally verbalized back into natural-language questions.

Result: Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA datasets show significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: LFC-DA provides an effective method for LLM-guided logical data augmentation that ensures both diversity and logical rigor under propositional logic, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is
costly, whereas direct generation with large language models yields
uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present
LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to
propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded
state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then
verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and
logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show
significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained
models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data
augmentation.

### [68] [Segmentation Beyond Defaults: Asymmetrical Byte Pair Encoding for Optimal Machine Translation Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03383)
*Saumitra Yadav,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Asymmetric BPE with different merge operations for source and target languages outperforms symmetric BPE in machine translation, especially for low-resource language pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MT research uses symmetric BPE with the same number of merge operations for both languages, but this may not be optimal across different language pairs and data sizes.

Method: Investigated BPE segmentation recipes across various data volumes and language pairs, comparing symmetric vs asymmetric BPE approaches with different numbers of merge operations.

Result: Asymmetric BPE significantly improves MT performance over symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K-500K sentence pairs), with statistically significant gains of up to 5.32 CHRF++ for English-Hindi and improvements in 10 out of 12 tested systems.

Conclusion: Optimal MT performance is achieved with high NMO for source (4K-32K) and low NMO for target (0.5K-2K), particularly benefiting low-resource machine translation.

Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set
of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train
tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that
this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different
language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes
across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system
performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target
languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the
symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K
sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant
($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in
low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language
pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),
observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems
compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K
to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,
particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

*Célian Ringwald,Fabien Gandon,Catherine Faron,Franck Michel,Hanna Abi Akl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how small language models (SLMs) handle both datatype and object properties for complete RDF graph extraction, identifying the long-tail distribution of rare properties as the key bottleneck and evaluating various strategies to address this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend SLMs' capabilities beyond common datatype properties to handle both datatype and object properties for complete RDF graph extraction, addressing the challenge of long-tail distribution of rare properties.

Method: The authors evaluated several strategies including stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation to handle the unbalanced distribution of target properties.

Result: The best strategy identified was to build a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given threshold, which enables SLMs to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical guidance for training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in semantic relation extraction, with datasets, experimental results, and code publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE)
when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype
properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object
properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck
is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue,
we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset
scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best
strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build
a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given
threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets,
experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for
training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in
semantic RE.

*Canhui Wu,Qiong Cao,Chao Xue,Wei Xi,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 3TF is a framework that trains models to internalize reasoning processes, enabling them to perform implicit reasoning during inference without generating explicit step-by-step outputs, achieving improved efficiency while maintaining reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods rely on explicit Chain-of-Thought prompting during inference, which generates verbose outputs and reduces efficiency. The authors aim to develop a more efficient approach that internalizes reasoning while keeping outputs concise.

Method: Train a hybrid model with both reasoning and non-reasoning modes, then further train it on CoT-annotated data to internalize structured reasoning. During inference, use the non-reasoning mode to enforce concise, thought-free outputs while maintaining implicit reasoning capabilities.

Result: 3TF-trained models show large improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, demonstrating that high-quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

Conclusion: The 3TF framework successfully enables models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping external outputs short, providing an efficient alternative to traditional explicit reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most
existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These
Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on
explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF}
(\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree
inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long
perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning
and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to
internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs
at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based
approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,
enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping
external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large
improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,
demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed
implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

### [71] [Knowledge-Augmented Question Error Correction for Chinese Question Answer System with QuestionRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03410)
*Longpeng Qiu,Ting Li,Shuai Mao,Nan Yang,Xiaohui Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QuestionRAG is a framework that improves LLMs' ability to correct input errors in QA systems by combining knowledge augmentation to address misinterpretation and RL-based alignment to prevent over-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to properly handle input errors in QA systems, either misinterpreting user intent or unnecessarily altering question structure through over-correction.

Method: Uses knowledge augmentation (search results, related entities) to address misinterpretation and reinforcement learning to align model objectives with precise correction rather than paraphrasing.

Result: Knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions, and RL-based alignment is significantly more effective than supervised fine-tuning, improving instruction following and generalization.

Conclusion: By integrating knowledge augmentation and RL-based alignment, QuestionRAG unlocks LLMs' full potential for question correction tasks.

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect
responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently
failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering
the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a
framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it
enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related
entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding
faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more
effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's
ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two
strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question
correction task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CareMedEval is a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal tasks, derived from French medical exams with 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. It reveals current LLMs struggle with critical reasoning in specialized domains, especially on study limitations and statistical analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is essential in biomedical fields, but LLMs have limited reliability for critical reasoning in specialized domains. There's a need for better evaluation benchmarks to assess LLM capabilities in this area.

Method: Created CareMedEval dataset from authentic French medical student exams containing 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Benchmark tested state-of-the-art generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions, including with and without intermediate reasoning tokens.

Result: Both open and commercial LLMs failed to exceed an Exact Match Rate of 0.5, though generating intermediate reasoning tokens improved results. Models performed particularly poorly on questions about study limitations and statistical analysis.

Conclusion: CareMedEval provides a challenging benchmark that exposes current LLM limitations in grounded biomedical reasoning and paves the way for developing better automated support for critical appraisal in specialized domains.

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the
biomedical field. While large language models (LLMs) can offer promising
support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for
critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an
original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and
reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students,
the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike
existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and
reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions
reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed
an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens
considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on
questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval
provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM
limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for
critical appraisal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Kastor is a framework that enhances RDF pattern-based extraction for fine-tuning small language models by reformulating SHACL shape validation to evaluate all property combinations, improving model generalization and enabling iterative refinement of noisy knowledge bases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for completing and refining knowledge bases in specialized domains using efficient small language models trained on limited text and RDF data.

Method: Reformulates traditional SHACL shape validation to evaluate all possible property combinations from the shape, selects optimal combinations for training examples, and employs iterative learning to refine noisy knowledge bases.

Result: Significantly enhances model generalization and performance, enabling the creation of robust models capable of uncovering new relevant facts.

Conclusion: Kastor advances RDF pattern-based extraction by providing a more comprehensive validation approach and iterative refinement process, making it effective for knowledge base completion in specialized domains.

Abstract: RDF pattern-based extraction is a compelling approach for fine-tuning small
language models (SLMs) by focusing a relation extraction task on a specified
SHACL shape. This technique enables the development of efficient models trained
on limited text and RDF data. In this article, we introduce Kastor, a framework
that advances this approach to meet the demands for completing and refining
knowledge bases in specialized domains. Kastor reformulates the traditional
validation task, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all
possible combinations of properties derived from the shape. By selecting the
optimal combination for each training example, the framework significantly
enhances model generalization and performance. Additionally, Kastor employs an
iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, enabling the
creation of robust models capable of uncovering new, relevant facts

TL;DR: BanglaSTEM is a dataset of 5,000 Bangla-English STEM sentence pairs that improves technical translation accuracy, enabling better use of English language models for Bangla speakers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform poorly on technical Bangla questions due to mistranslation of specialized vocabulary by existing translation systems.

Method: Created BanglaSTEM dataset with 5,000 carefully selected STEM sentence pairs, used language models to generate 12,000+ translations, human-evaluated for quality, and trained a T5-based translation model.

Result: Significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical content, enabling better code generation and math problem solving for Bangla speakers using English-focused models.

Conclusion: BanglaSTEM dataset and trained translation model effectively address technical translation challenges, making English language models more accessible to Bangla speakers in STEM fields.

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but
perform poorly when the same questions are asked in Bangla. A simple solution
would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these
models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with
technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes
the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a
dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM
fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then
used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve
technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on
BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems.
Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical
content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language
models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation
model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HaluMem is the first operation-level hallucination evaluation benchmark for memory systems, introducing three evaluation tasks to identify hallucination behaviors across different operational stages of AI memory systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory systems in AI frequently exhibit hallucinations during storage and retrieval, but existing evaluations are end-to-end question answering, making it difficult to localize where hallucinations arise within the memory system.

Method: Developed HaluMem benchmark with three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question answering) and constructed user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets (HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long) with about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type questions.

Result: Empirical studies show existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate hallucinations during extraction and updating stages, which subsequently propagate errors to question answering stage.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are limited to fixed turns, susceptible to saturation, and fail to account for user interactive experience, necessitating better assessment of multi-turn instruction-following.

Method: Three-layer framework decoupling linguistic forms from user intent, tracking constraints/instructions/topics, enabling dynamic benchmark construction with state changes and tracebacks, terminating when user patience is exhausted.

Result: GPT-5 shows superior performance with average 18.54 conversational turns and 70.31% robustness, significantly outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by 11.41%, with other models lagging far behind.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively assesses multi-turn instruction-following ability, revealing GPT-5's superior performance, and provides an extensible benchmark for future evaluation.

Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions
throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for
data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often
limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and
failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we
propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following
ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from
user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,
instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by
enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and
tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated
user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the
interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving
instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.
Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following
performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and
demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant
margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code
will be made publicly available online.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create large, high-quality datasets for comparing logical reasoning skills across multiple languages and difficulty levels suitable for LLMs with different reasoning abilities.

Method: Generated zebra puzzles in multiple languages, themes, sizes (2x3 and 4x5), including 14 clue types and 8 red herring types. Tested on GPT-4o mini and o3-mini models.

Result: Puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 were sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini and o3-mini respectively. Red herrings decreased o3-mini accuracy by 15±7% on 4x5 puzzles. No significant language or theme effects, and no correlation between difficulty and clue types.

Conclusion: Published MultiZebraLogic datasets in nine Germanic languages with code for adaptable puzzle generation, providing a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning across languages and difficulty levels.

Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires
benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality
datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages
and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore
multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple
languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red
herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are
sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a
reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini
puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5
puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the
common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no
correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of
128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic
languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation,
designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neural networks with stack augmentation can achieve human-like hierarchical generalization in language learning without requiring syntactic supervision, massive pre-training, or extended training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether neural networks can naturally develop hierarchical syntactic biases like human children do, without needing special training conditions that previous research required.

Method: Tested three base architectures (transformer, simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two stack types: superposition stack and a nondeterministic generalization of it. Also proposed a modification to stack RNN architecture.

Result: Transformers with nondeterministic stacks generalized best on a classical question formation task. The modified stack RNN architecture improved hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: Stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language acquisition than standard architectures and serve as useful tools for psycholinguistic study.

Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of
hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that
when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on
hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.
A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network
architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special
conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,
or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the
first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in
human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:
stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,
simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack
of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed
by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic
stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question
formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture
that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that
stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language
acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of
psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces controllable locality in transformer language models, enabling continuous adjustment between localist and distributed representations via a tunable locality parameter without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for transparent language models in regulated domains by providing dynamic control over representation interpretability while maintaining performance.

Method: Used a two-layer transformer architecture on WikiText corpus with systematic variation of locality parameter λ from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed).

Result: Localist configurations achieved dramatically lower attention entropy (5.36 bits vs 7.18 bits) and higher pointer fidelity. Intermediate locality (λ=0.6) optimized tradeoff with 4.65 perplexity and 84.7% accuracy.

Conclusion: Localist language models provide a practical framework for regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise control over the interpretability-performance spectrum.

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable
locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that
enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization
through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models
that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows
dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and
efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We
conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer
architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across
the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our
results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower
attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18
bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer
fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.
Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the
tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6
achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings
establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for
applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,
offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance
spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design
principles.

Conclusion: The large-margin learning approach successfully enables expressive audio editing and zero-shot TTS capabilities without traditional disentanglement methods, establishing a new paradigm for audio model development.

Abstract: We present Step-Audio-EditX, the first open-source LLM-based audio model
excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion,

Conclusion: ChiMDQA offers a comprehensive, high-quality dataset applicable to various NLP tasks including document comprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies,
the demand for high-quality Chinese document question-answering datasets is
steadily growing. To address this issue, we present the Chinese Multi-Document
Question Answering Dataset(ChiMDQA), specifically designed for downstream
business scenarios across prevalent domains including academic, education,
finance, law, medical treatment, and news. ChiMDQA encompasses long-form
documents from six distinct fields, consisting of 6,068 rigorously curated,
high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs further classified into ten
fine-grained categories. Through meticulous document screening and a systematic
question-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high
quality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document
comprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,
this paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,
construction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a
substantial foundation for future research and practical applications in
Chinese QA. The code and data are available at:

*Nan Li,Albert Gatt,Massimo Poesio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A perspectivist annotation framework for analyzing referential understanding in collaborative dialogue, showing that while full misunderstandings are rare, multiplicity discrepancies systematically cause referential misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how participants in asymmetric collaborative settings may believe they agree while actually referring to different entities, and to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time.

Method: Developed a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus that separately captures speaker and addressee interpretations, using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline to obtain 13k annotated reference expressions.

Result: Full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment.

Conclusion: The framework provides both a resource and analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing
common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while
referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme
for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures
speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,
enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over
time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k
annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the
resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings
are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies
systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask
referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an
analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating
(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative
dialogue.

### [86] [Towards Transparent Stance Detection: A Zero-Shot Approach Using Implicit and Explicit Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03635)
*Apoorva Upadhyaya,Wolfgang Nejdl,Marco Fisichella*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS is a novel interpretable Zero-Shot Stance Detection framework that combines implicit rationales (text sequences) and explicit rationales (linguistic measures) to understand attitudes toward unseen targets, treating stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task without requiring ground-truth rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSSD methods suffer from generalizability issues, lack of coherence between text and target, over-reliance on explicit reasoning, coarse explanations, and lack of explicit modeling of the reasoning process, making predictions difficult to interpret.

Method: IRIS provides interpretable understanding through implicit rationales (text sequences) and explicit rationales (linguistic measures). It treats stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding relevance of implicit rationales for different stances without ground-truth rationale data.

Result: Extensive experiments on VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD datasets using 50%, 30%, and 10% training data demonstrate the model's generalizability and effectiveness, benefiting from the proposed architecture and interpretable design.

Conclusion: IRIS addresses key limitations in ZSSD by providing inherent interpretability through combined implicit and explicit rationales, enabling better understanding of author attitudes toward targets without requiring ground-truth rationale data.

Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward
unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data
augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between
text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD
focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating
explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by
their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that
lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it
difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our
study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an
interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target
implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and
explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers
stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the
relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model
towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,
thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales
based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive
dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's
attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%
training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the
proposed architecture and interpretable design.

*Francesco Corso,Francesco Pierri,Gianmarco De Francisci Morales*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show partial conspiratorial tendencies, exhibit sociodemographic biases in conspiracy beliefs, and can be easily manipulated into adopting conspiratorial perspectives through targeted prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs reproduce higher-order psychological constructs like conspiratorial mindset, given their increasing use as proxies for studying human behavior and the critical role of conspiracy beliefs in misinformation spread.

Method: Administer validated psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple LLMs under different prompting and conditioning strategies.

Result: LLMs show partial agreement with conspiracy beliefs, conditioning with socio-demographic attributes reveals latent biases, and targeted prompts easily shift model responses toward conspiratorial directions.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit psychological dimensions including conspiratorial tendencies and biases, highlighting the need for critical evaluation to advance computational social science and develop mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this
domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial
perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of
misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a
critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are
increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known
about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a
conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated
psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under
different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs
show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning
with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent
demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses
toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs
to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive
contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the
psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social
science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

*Jon Kutasov,Chloe Loughridge,Yuqi Sun,Henry Sleight,Buck Shlegeris,Tyler Tracy,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of AI control protocols in agentic environments shows that resampling and critical action deferral increase safety from 50% to 96%, but adaptive attacks can reduce resampling effectiveness to 17% safety, while critical action deferral remains robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents become more capable and widely deployed, ensuring their safe operation is critical. AI control protocols need evaluation against both current attacks and adaptive adversaries to understand their effectiveness and robustness.

Method: Evaluated control protocols (deferral to trusted models, resampling, deferring on critical actions) in SHADE-Arena dataset of diverse agentic environments. Tested blue team protocols against default attacks, then iterated red team strategies with additional affordances like knowledge of resampling timing and ability to simulate monitors.

Result: Resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions performed best initially, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. However, adaptive red team strategies with protocol knowledge reduced resampling safety to 17%, while critical action deferral remained highly robust even against strongest attacks.

Conclusion: Critical action deferral is highly robust to adaptive attacks, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals for maintaining AI safety.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable and widely deployed as agents, ensuring
their safe operation becomes critical. AI control offers one approach to
mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and
intervening or auditing when necessary. Evaluating the safety of these
protocols requires understanding both their effectiveness against current
attacks and their robustness to adaptive adversaries. In this work, we
systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset
of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols,
including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical
actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for
incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety
from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols
and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of
when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially
improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety
to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our
strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack
policies access to protocol internals.

### [89] [PublicAgent: Multi-Agent Design Principles From an LLM-Based Open Data Analysis Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03023)
*Sina Montazeri,Yunhe Feng,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PublicAgent is a multi-agent framework that decomposes data analysis workflows into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting, addressing LLM limitations in end-to-end analytical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open data repositories are inaccessible to non-experts due to required expertise in dataset discovery, schema mapping, and statistical analysis. Current LLMs show fundamental limitations in end-to-end analytical workflows including attention dilution, interference of specialized reasoning patterns, and undetected error propagation.

Method: A multi-agent framework with specialized agents for different analytical tasks: intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage.

Result: Evaluation across five models and 50 queries showed 97.5% agent win rates even for the strongest model, with universal agents (discovery, analysis) showing consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) and conditional agents (report, intent) varying by model (std dev 20.5%). Removing discovery or analysis agents caused catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent caused quality degradation.

Conclusion: Five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems: 1) Specialization provides value independent of model strength, 2) Agents divide into universal and conditional categories, 3) Agents mitigate distinct failure modes, 4) Architectural benefits persist across task complexity, 5) Model-aware architecture design is required due to wide variance in agent effectiveness across models.

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating large language models as judges is critical for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines, requiring systematic comparison of different LLM families.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework that aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels via scalable majority voting, applied to large-scale complementary-item recommendation tasks.

Result: Key findings: Claude 3.5 Sonnet has highest decision confidence; Gemini 1.5 Pro offers best overall performance; GPT-4o provides best latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; GPT-OSS 20B leads open-source models. Strong consensus in structured domains but disagreement in lifestyle categories.

Conclusion: ScalingEval establishes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, providing actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as judges is increasingly critical
for building scalable and trustworthy evaluation pipelines. We present
ScalingEval, a large-scale benchmarking study that systematically compares 36
LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, across multiple product
categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent
framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels
via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM
evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item
recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude
3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers
the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation protocol for LLMs as judges, with
actionable guidance on scaling, reliability, and model family tradeoffs.

### [91] [Epidemiology of Large Language Models: A Benchmark for Observational Distribution Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03070)
*Drago Plecko,Patrik Okanovic,Torsten Hoefler,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a benchmark to test whether large language models (LLMs) can internalize real-world probability distributions across domains like economics, health, and education, finding that LLMs perform poorly and lack observational distribution knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' capabilities in learning probabilistic knowledge about real-world distributions, given their training on vast text data and claims about being universal approximators, while considering statistical challenges like the curse of dimensionality.

Method: Developed the first benchmark to directly test whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across multiple domains including economics, health, education, and social behavior.

Result: LLMs perform poorly overall and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. They lack knowledge of observational distributions (Layer 1 of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy).

Conclusion: Language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions, and by implication from the Causal Hierarchy Theorem, their interventional and counterfactual knowledge is also limited, challenging claims about LLMs as universal distributional learners.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various
scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications.
Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order
to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SnapStream is a KV cache compression method that enables 4x improved on-chip memory usage with minimal accuracy degradation, specifically designed for production inference systems with static graphs and continuous batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of large LLMs with long context lengths creates high demands for on-chip memory for KV caches, but existing compression techniques are not compatible with industrial deployment frameworks like vLLM or SGLang due to static graphs and continuous batching constraints.

Method: Developed SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale in production inference systems with static graphs and continuous batching, tested on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1 models.

Result: Demonstrated 4x improved on-chip memory usage in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second, with minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: SnapStream is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques successfully deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching, addressing the memory demands of large LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

*Katherine C. Kellogg,Bingyang Ye,Yifan Hu,Guergana K. Savova,Byron Wallace,Danielle S. Bitterman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes capability-based monitoring for LLMs in healthcare, shifting from traditional task-based monitoring to focus on shared model capabilities like summarization and reasoning to detect systemic issues across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML monitoring approaches are inadequate for LLMs because they assume task-specific performance degradation from dataset drift, but LLMs are generalist systems not trained for specific tasks in particular populations.

Method: Proposes capability-based monitoring that organizes evaluation around shared internal capabilities (summarization, reasoning, translation, safety guardrails) rather than individual downstream tasks.

Result: This approach enables cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring would miss.

Conclusion: Capability-based monitoring provides a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist AI models in healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of the miniF2F benchmark reveals significant discrepancies between formal and informal math statements, with only 36% accuracy in full theorem proving pipeline despite high individual component performance. After corrections, accuracy improves to 70% in miniF2F-v2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance of AI systems in mathematical Olympiad settings where models must read natural language problems, formalize them in Lean, and prove them, identifying gaps between autoformalization and theorem proving capabilities.

Method: Thorough analysis of miniF2F benchmark problems, identification of discrepancies between formal and informal statements, correction of errors, and creation of miniF2F-v2 with verified statements and proofs.

Result: Original pipeline accuracy was 36% vs individual component accuracies of 97% (autoformalization) and 69% (theorem proving). After corrections in miniF2F-v2, accuracy improved to 70%, revealing significant misalignment between autoformalization models and theorem provers.

Conclusion: Higher quality benchmarks like miniF2F-v2 are crucial for accurately evaluating progress in formal reasoning and diagnosing failure modes in autoformalization and theorem proving models.

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available

*Shipeng Cen,Ying Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-modal large language models (MLLM) with the fireworks algorithm (FWA) to enhance optimization algorithm design, particularly for complex high-dimensional tasks like TSP and EDA problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with non-convex, high-dimensional, black-box problems due to low efficiency, inaccurate gradients, and insufficient information utilization. The rapid advancement of LLMs' language understanding and code generation capabilities offers new opportunities for optimization algorithm design.

Method: The authors propose integrating MLLM with FWA by introducing the concept of Critical Part (CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks and leverages MLLM's multi-modal characteristics to better utilize optimization process information.

Result: Experimental results on traveling salesman problem (TSP) and electronic design automation (EDA) problems show that the proposed framework achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on many problem instances.

Conclusion: The integration of MLLM with traditional optimization algorithms like FWA represents a promising direction for addressing complex optimization challenges, demonstrating significant performance improvements on benchmark problems.

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on

*Qi Li,Jianjun Xu,Pingtao Wei,Jiu Li,Peiqiang Zhao,Jiwei Shi,Xuan Zhang,Yanhui Yang,Xiaodong Hui,Peng Xu,Wenqin Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel safety response framework for LLMs that provides systematic protection at both input and output levels, achieving high risk recall and perfect safety scores in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security issues in LLMs are constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains, necessitating systematic safety measures.

Method: Input-level: supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification with four-tier taxonomy; Output-level: RAG integration with fine-tuned interpretation model for grounded responses.

Result: 99.3% risk recall rate, significantly higher safety scores on public benchmarks, and perfect 100% safety score on proprietary high-risk test set.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective engineering pathway for building high-security, high-trust LLM applications with exceptional protective capabilities.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

*Xuanxiang Huang,Yacine Izza,Alexey Ignatiev,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper develops a validation methodology for formal XAI explainers and finds that PyXAI produces incorrect explanations on most tested datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal XAI provides theoretical guarantees but lacks practical validation of implementations. Little attention has been given to validating whether formal explainers actually work correctly in practice.

Method: Developed a novel methodology for validating formal explainers and applied it to assess PyXAI, a publicly available formal explainer.

Result: Found that PyXAI computes incorrect explanations on most of the datasets analyzed in the experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed validation methodology is important for ensuring the reliability of formal explainers, as demonstrated by the discovery of incorrect explanations in PyXAI.

Abstract: Formal explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers unique theoretical
guarantees of rigor when compared to other non-formal methods of
explainability. However, little attention has been given to the validation of
practical implementations of formal explainers. This paper develops a novel
methodology for validating formal explainers and reports on the assessment of
the publicly available formal explainer PyXAI. The paper documents the
existence of incorrect explanations computed by PyXAI on most of the datasets
analyzed in the experiments, thereby confirming the importance of the proposed
novel methodology for the validation of formal explainers.

### [98] [Toward Autonomous Engineering Design: A Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03179)
*Varun Kumar,George Em Karniadakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent AI framework for engineering design that uses specialized agents (Graph Ontologist, Design Engineer, Systems Engineer) to collaboratively generate and refine designs through iterative feedback loops, demonstrated on NACA airfoil optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional engineering design processes are resource-intensive and inefficient due to the need for multi-domain expertise and complex collaborations. The paper aims to address these inefficiencies through AI-driven automation.

Method: Three AI agents collaborate: Graph Ontologist builds domain knowledge graphs using LLMs, Systems Engineer formulates requirements, and Design Engineer generates candidates. They engage in iterative feedback loops with qualitative and quantitative reviews until validation.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrated aerodynamic optimization of NACA airfoils, generating designs that meet technical requirements and can be optimized for performance metrics like lift-to-drag ratio.

Conclusion: Collaborative AI agents with structured knowledge representations can significantly enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in engineering design processes, providing a viable alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

*Yi-Fei Liu,Yi-Long Lu,Di He,Hang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can accurately model human psychological trait correlations by role-playing Big Five Personality responses and generating responses on other psychological scales, achieving near-human-level accuracy through a systematic two-stage reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can capture the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs and understand their reasoning process.

Method: Prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 humans to role-play responses on nine other psychological scales, then analyzed reasoning traces.

Result: LLMs achieved remarkable accuracy (R² > 0.89) in capturing human psychological structure, exceeding semantic similarity predictions and approaching trained ML algorithm performance. They use a two-stage process: transforming raw responses into personality summaries, then generating target responses.

Conclusion: LLMs can precisely predict psychological traits through abstraction and reasoning, offering powerful tools for psychological simulation and insights into emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

*Ming Gu,Ziwei Wang,Sicen Lai,Zirui Gao,Sheng Zhou,Jiajun Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AAA is a human-AI partnership framework for scalable web accessibility auditing that operationalizes WCAG-EM through GRASP sampling and MaC copilot, enabling end-to-end evaluation with reduced human effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web accessibility auditing practices are resource-intensive and unscalable, leaving most websites non-compliant despite WCAG-EM providing structured methodology but lacking practical support for large-scale execution.

Method: AAA framework with two key innovations: GRASP (graph-based multimodal sampling for representative page coverage) and MaC (multimodal LLM-based copilot for cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks).

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate method effectiveness, showing small-scale language models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned, with four novel datasets contributed for benchmarking audit pipeline stages.

Conclusion: The AAA framework enables scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing through human-AI partnership, empowering auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact on web accessibility compliance.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

*Richard Dewey,Janos Botyanszki,Ciamac C. Moallemi,Andrew T. Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Solly is the first AI agent to achieve elite human performance in multi-player Liar's Poker, outperforming both human experts and large language models through deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous AI breakthroughs in poker-like games focused on two-player dynamics, but real-world scenarios often involve extensive multi-player engagement. Liar's Poker provides a testbed for environments with multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: Trained using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: Solly achieved elite human level performance with over 50% win rate and positive equity in both heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. It outperformed LLMs, developed novel bidding strategies, effectively randomized play, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning can create AI agents capable of elite performance in complex multi-player games with imperfect information, advancing beyond previous two-player focused achievements.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.

### [104] [Scheduling the Off-Diagonal Weingarten Loss of Neural SDFs for CAD Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03147)
*Haotian Yin,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This paper proposes scheduling strategies for the Off-Diagonal Weingarten (ODW) loss in neural SDFs for CAD reconstruction, showing that time-varying schedules outperform fixed weights and achieve up to 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed ODW weights in FlatCAD are suboptimal because strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail recovery in later stages of training.

Method: The authors present various scheduling strategies for the ODW loss, including constant, linear, quintic, step interpolation schedules, and an increasing warm-up variant, that assign high initial weights for stability and progressively decay them for fine-scale refinement.

Result: Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset show that time-varying schedules consistently outperform fixed weights, achieving up to 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline.

Conclusion: Scheduling strategies for curvature regularization are a simple yet effective extension for robust CAD reconstruction using neural SDFs.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have become a powerful representation
for geometric reconstruction from point clouds, yet they often require both
gradient- and curvature-based regularization to suppress spurious warp and
preserve structural fidelity. FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten
(ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating
full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However,
FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal:
strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail
recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss
that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively
decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear,
quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up
variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying
schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a
35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing
scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for
robust CAD reconstruction.

### [105] [Visualization Biases MLLM's Decision Making in Network Data Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03617)
*Timo Brand,Henry Förster,Stephen G. Kobourov,Jacob Miller*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Visualizations influence MLLM judgments about bridge presence in networks, improving confidence but creating strong biases independent of actual bridge existence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how visualizations affect MLLMs' judgment accuracy and confidence when assessing bridge presence in networks, and understand potential biases introduced by visualization techniques.

Method: Compared MLLM performance with visualization inputs versus structured text-based inputs for determining bridge presence in networks, analyzing confidence levels and bias patterns.

Result: Visualizations improved MLLM confidence over text inputs but created strong biases toward accepting or refuting bridge presence regardless of actual network structure.

Conclusion: While visualizations can influence MLLM judgment without compromising confidence, practitioners must be cautious about allowing visualizations in AI applications to prevent undesired hallucinations and biases.

Abstract: We evaluate how visualizations can influence the judgment of MLLMs about the
presence or absence of bridges in a network. We show that the inclusion of
visualization improves confidence over a structured text-based input that could
theoretically be helpful for answering the question. On the other hand, we
observe that standard visualization techniques create a strong bias towards
accepting or refuting the presence of a bridge -- independently of whether or
not a bridge actually exists in the network. While our results indicate that
the inclusion of visualization techniques can effectively influence the MLLM's
judgment without compromising its self-reported confidence, they also imply
that practitioners must be careful of allowing users to include visualizations
in generative AI applications so as to avoid undesired hallucinations.
