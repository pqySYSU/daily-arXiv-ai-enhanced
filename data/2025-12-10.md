*Alexander Goslin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terrain Diffusion is an AI-based successor to Perlin noise that uses diffusion models to generate infinite, seamless, and coherent procedural terrain with real-time synthesis capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional procedural noise functions like Perlin noise are fast and infinite but limited in realism and large-scale coherence. The paper aims to bridge the gap between the fidelity of modern diffusion models and the essential properties of procedural noise systems.

Method: Introduces Terrain Diffusion with InfiniteDiffusion algorithm for infinite generation, hierarchical diffusion models for planetary context and local detail, compact Laplacian encoding for stability across Earth-scale ranges, open-source infinite-tensor framework, and few-step consistency distillation for efficiency.

Result: The system establishes diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits while maintaining seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access.

Conclusion: Terrain Diffusion successfully bridges diffusion model fidelity with procedural noise properties, creating an AI-era successor that enables realistic, infinite, and coherent terrain generation for procedural worlds.

Abstract: For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visionary is a web-native platform for real-time 3D Gaussian Splatting and mesh rendering that unifies inference and rendering in the browser, enabling dynamic neural processing with a lightweight, click-to-run experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting viewer solutions are fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models.

Method: Built on efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference; introduces standardized Gaussian Generator contract for plug-and-play algorithms; offers three.js plugin library with TypeScript API; uses GPU-based primitive sorting for efficiency.

Result: Achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers; supports multiple variants including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation networks; enables real-time dynamic neural processing in browser.

Conclusion: Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

Abstract: Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

### [3] [Selfi: Self Improving Reconstruction Engine via 3D Geometric Feature Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08930)
*Youming Deng,Songyou Peng,Junyi Zhang,Kathryn Heal,Tiancheng Sun,John Flynn,Steve Marschner,Lucy Chai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Selfi improves 3D reconstruction by aligning VGGT features for better geometric consistency, achieving SOTA in novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NVS relies on explicit 3D biases and known camera parameters, while VGGT learns 3D knowledge implicitly but lacks explicit multi-view geometric consistency. Improving 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks.

Method: Selfi is a self-improving pipeline that transforms VGGT into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine using its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. It trains a lightweight feature adapter with reprojection-based consistency loss to distill VGGT outputs into a geometrically-aligned feature space capturing 3D spatial proximity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment significantly benefits downstream 3D reasoning.

Conclusion: Feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning, enabling vision foundation models like VGGT to achieve better geometric consistency and improved performance in 3D reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) has traditionally relied on models with explicit 3D inductive biases combined with known camera parameters from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) beforehand. Recent vision foundation models like VGGT take an orthogonal approach -- 3D knowledge is gained implicitly through training data and loss objectives, enabling feed-forward prediction of both camera parameters and 3D representations directly from a set of uncalibrated images. While flexible, VGGT features lack explicit multi-view geometric consistency, and we find that improving such 3D feature consistency benefits both NVS and pose estimation tasks. We introduce Selfi, a self-improving 3D reconstruction pipeline via feature alignment, transforming a VGGT backbone into a high-fidelity 3D reconstruction engine by leveraging its own outputs as pseudo-ground-truth. Specifically, we train a lightweight feature adapter using a reprojection-based consistency loss, which distills VGGT outputs into a new geometrically-aligned feature space that captures spatial proximity in 3D. This enables state-of-the-art performance in both NVS and camera pose estimation, demonstrating that feature alignment is a highly beneficial step for downstream 3D reasoning.

*Kuldip Singh Atwal,Dieter Pfoser,Daniel Rothbart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning model using 4-band Planet Labs imagery enables near real-time monitoring of fire damage in Sudan conflict with minimal delay, outperforming baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ongoing war in Sudan requires rapid conflict monitoring. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite imagery allow for near real-time monitoring of conflict-related damage.

Method: Uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to monitor fire damage in armed conflicts. Tested on five case studies in Sudan, comparing against baseline methods.

Result: Automated method captures active fires and charred areas more accurately than baseline. Using 8-band imagery or time series provides only marginal gains over 4-band imagery.

Conclusion: Fire damage in armed conflicts can be effectively monitored with minimal delay using 4-band satellite imagery and deep learning, providing a practical solution for rapid conflict monitoring.

Abstract: The challenges of ongoing war in Sudan highlight the need for rapid moni- toring and analysis of such conflicts. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitor- ing. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our re- sults indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.

*Zekai Luo,Zongze Du,Zhouhang Zhu,Hao Zhong,Muzhi Zhu,Wen Wang,Yuling Xi,Chenchen Jing,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LivingSwap is a video face swapping method that uses keyframe conditioning and video reference guidance to achieve high fidelity and temporal consistency in long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video face swapping faces challenges in achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long, complex video sequences. The authors explore whether reference-guided image editing techniques can be adapted to leverage rich visual attributes from source videos to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping.

Method: LivingSwap employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. It combines keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance to perform temporal stitching for stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction. The authors also construct a paired face-swapping dataset called Face2Face and reverse data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision for reference-guided training.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results, with the method seamlessly integrating target identity with source video's expressions, lighting, and motion while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

Conclusion: LivingSwap presents the first video reference guided face swapping model that successfully addresses the challenges of fidelity and temporal consistency in long video sequences, offering practical benefits for film and entertainment production workflows.

Abstract: Video face swapping is crucial in film and entertainment production, where achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long and complex video sequences remains a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

### [7] [Restrictive Hierarchical Semantic Segmentation for Stratified Tooth Layer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07984)
*Ryan Banks,Camila Lindoni Azevedo,Hongying Tang,Yunpeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical semantic segmentation framework for dental anatomy that embeds explicit anatomical structure through recurrent level-wise prediction, feature conditioning, and consistency rules, improving performance on fine-grained anatomies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods provide weak supervision through loss functions only. Accurate anatomical structure understanding is essential for reliable dental disease staging, requiring better hierarchical modeling in segmentation.

Method: Framework embeds explicit anatomical hierarchy via recurrent level-wise prediction with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. Uses Feature-wise Linear Modulation to condition child class features on parent probabilities, probabilistic composition rules for consistency, and hierarchical loss combining per-level Dice/CE with consistency terms.

Result: Hierarchical variants consistently increased IoU, Dice, and recall (especially for fine-grained anatomies) and produced more anatomically coherent masks. However, they showed increased recall over precision (more false positives). Demonstrated improved performance and clinical plausibility in low-data dental imaging regimes.

Conclusion: Explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility for dental anatomy segmentation, particularly beneficial for fine-grained anatomies in low-data scenarios, though with trade-off of increased false positives.

Abstract: Accurate understanding of anatomical structures is essential for reliably staging certain dental diseases. A way of introducing this within semantic segmentation models is by utilising hierarchy-aware methodologies. However, existing hierarchy-aware segmentation methods largely encode anatomical structure through the loss functions, providing weak and indirect supervision. We introduce a general framework that embeds an explicit anatomical hierarchy into semantic segmentation by coupling a recurrent, level-wise prediction scheme with restrictive output heads and top-down feature conditioning. At each depth of the class tree, the backbone is re-run on the original image concatenated with logits from the previous level. Child class features are conditioned using Feature-wise Linear Modulation of their parent class probabilities, to modulate child feature spaces for fine grained detection. A probabilistic composition rule enforces consistency between parent and descendant classes. Hierarchical loss combines per-level class weighted Dice and cross entropy loss and a consistency term loss, ensuring parent predictions are the sum of their children. We validate our approach on our proposed dataset, TL-pano, containing 194 panoramic radiographs with dense instance and semantic segmentation annotations, of tooth layers and alveolar bone. Utilising UNet and HRNet as donor models across a 5-fold cross validation scheme, the hierarchical variants consistently increase IoU, Dice, and recall, particularly for fine-grained anatomies, and produce more anatomically coherent masks. However, hierarchical variants also demonstrated increased recall over precision, implying increased false positives. The results demonstrate that explicit hierarchical structuring improves both performance and clinical plausibility, especially in low data dental imaging regimes.

### [8] [FRIEDA: Benchmarking Multi-Step Cartographic Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08016)
*Jiyoon Pyo,Yuankun Jiao,Dongwon Jung,Zekun Li,Leeje Jang,Sofia Kirsanova,Jina Kim,Yijun Lin,Qin Liu,Junyi Xie,Hadi Askari,Nan Xu,Muhao Chen,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FRIEDA is a new benchmark for evaluating complex cartographic reasoning in large vision-language models, focusing on spatial relations across multiple maps where current models perform poorly compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current map visual question-answering benchmarks treat maps as simple charts, missing the complexity of layered symbology and spatial relations. There's a need for proper evaluation of cartographic reasoning skills essential for real-world applications like disaster response and urban planning.

Method: Created FRIEDA benchmark using real map images from various domains and geographical areas. Questions target all three GIS spatial relation categories (topological, metric, directional) and require multi-step inference, often with cross-map grounding. Evaluated 11 state-of-the-art LVLMs in direct and contextual settings.

Result: Even the strongest models (Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think) achieved only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. This reveals a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: FRIEDA serves as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress in spatial intelligence for LVLMs, highlighting significant limitations in current models' ability to perform complex cartographic reasoning compared to human capabilities.

Abstract: Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

### [9] [SSplain: Sparse and Smooth Explainer for Retinopathy of Prematurity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08038)
*Elifnur Sunger,Tales Imbiriba,Peter Campbell,Deniz Erdogmus,Stratis Ioannidis,Jennifer Dy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSplain is a novel explainer method for ROP classification from fundus images that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures through smoothness and sparsity constraints, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks used in medical diagnosis need explainability for clinician trust, but existing methods fail to preserve important image structures like smoothness and sparsity in their explanations.

Method: SSplain formulates an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints to generate pixel-wise explanations that enforce smoothness and sparsity, solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

Result: SSplain outperforms common explainers in post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses, identifies clinically relevant features for ROP, and generalizes well to additional public datasets.

Conclusion: SSplain provides realistic, structure-preserving explanations for medical image classification that enhance clinician understanding and trust in black-box models, with demonstrated effectiveness on ROP and other datasets.

Abstract: Neural networks are frequently used in medical diagnosis. However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/SSplain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified model for sign language understanding that performs both sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA), achieving state-of-the-art results on BSL and demonstrating strong cross-linguistic generalization to ASL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical system for converting continuous signing videos into spoken language text and aligning signing with subtitles, which are essential for communication, corpus construction, and educational applications in sign language domains.

Method: Three-component approach: (1) lightweight visual backbone using human keypoints and lip-region images for privacy preservation, (2) Sliding Perceiver mapping network to aggregate visual features into word-level embeddings, and (3) multi-task scalable training strategy jointly optimizing SLT and SSA with multilingual pretraining on BSL and ASL datasets.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA tasks, and demonstrated robust zero-shot generalization and fine-tuned performance on How2Sign (ASL), showing scalable translation across different sign languages.

Conclusion: The proposed unified model successfully addresses both sign language translation and alignment tasks with strong cross-linguistic generalization, highlighting the potential for scalable sign language understanding systems across different sign languages through multilingual pretraining and effective model design.

Abstract: Our aim is to develop a unified model for sign language understanding, that performs sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA). Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA. Our model also demonstrates robust zero-shot generalisation and finetuned SLT performance on How2Sign (ASL), highlighting the potential of scalable translation across different sign languages.

*Chandler Timm C. Doloriel,Habib Ullah,Kristian Hovde Liland,Fadi Al Machot,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-domain masking improves universal deepfake detection by enhancing generalization to unseen generators while maintaining performance under model pruning for resource-efficient screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal deepfake detection needs robust generalization to new unseen generators while minimizing computational overhead for large-scale screening in the Green AI era.

Method: Introduces frequency-domain masking as a training strategy with random masking and geometric transformations, focusing on frequency masking for superior generalization properties.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and maintains performance under significant model pruning.

Conclusion: Frequency-based masking offers a practical, scalable, and resource-conscious solution for sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

### [12] [Mask to Adapt: Simple Random Masking Enables Robust Continual Test-Time Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08048)
*Chandler Timm C. Doloriel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M2A is a simple continual test-time adaptation method using random masking with consistency and entropy objectives, achieving strong performance on corrupted datasets without complex uncertainty or attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shifts degrade image classifiers at test time. Existing CTTA methods use complex masking designs that depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores, adding complexity. The paper investigates whether simple random masking can suffice under strong corruption.

Method: Introduces Mask to Adapt (M2A): generates short sequences of randomly masked views (spatial or frequency), then adapts using two objectives: 1) mask consistency loss aligning predictions across different views, and 2) entropy minimization loss encouraging confident outputs. Studies two masking families: spatial (patch vs. pixel) and frequency (all vs. low vs. high).

Result: On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity 5), M2A (Spatial) achieves 8.3%/19.8%/39.2% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines. M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations show simple random masking is effective and robust.

Conclusion: Simple random masking schedule with consistency and entropy objectives is sufficient for effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals, challenging the need for complex custom-made masking designs.

Abstract: Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\ low vs.\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\%/19.8\%/39.2\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals.

*Christian Massao Konishi,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates various change detection models for Amazon deforestation monitoring using PRODES data, addressing limitations in existing approaches by testing modern architectures and preprocessing techniques to improve effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The preservation of the Amazon Rainforest is a global priority, but existing machine learning models for deforestation detection using PRODES data have limitations: unsatisfactory effectiveness, lack of modern architectures like self-attention mechanisms, and absence of methodological standardization for direct comparisons between studies.

Method: The authors evaluate various change detection models on a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and Transformer-based self-attention networks. They investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques such as filtering based on connected component size, texture replacement, and image enhancements. They also test different strategies for combining models to achieve superior results.

Result: The approaches significantly improve individual model effectiveness. By combining evaluated models, they achieve an F1-score of 80.41%, which is comparable to other recent works in the literature.

Conclusion: The study addresses gaps in Amazon deforestation detection by systematically evaluating modern change detection models and demonstrating that preprocessing techniques and model combination strategies can substantially improve detection performance, contributing to more effective monitoring of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

Abstract: The preservation of the Amazon Rainforest is one of the global priorities in combating climate change, protecting biodiversity, and safeguarding indigenous cultures. The Satellite-based Monitoring Project of Deforestation in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (PRODES), a project of the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), stands out as a fundamental initiative in this effort, annually monitoring deforested areas not only in the Amazon but also in other Brazilian biomes. Recently, machine learning models have been developed using PRODES data to support this effort through the comparative analysis of multitemporal satellite images, treating deforestation detection as a change detection problem. However, existing approaches present significant limitations: models evaluated in the literature still show unsatisfactory effectiveness, many do not incorporate modern architectures, such as those based on self-attention mechanisms, and there is a lack of methodological standardization that allows direct comparisons between different studies. In this work, we address these gaps by evaluating various change detection models in a unified dataset, including fully convolutional models and networks incorporating self-attention mechanisms based on Transformers. We investigate the impact of different pre- and post-processing techniques, such as filtering deforested areas predicted by the models based on the size of connected components, texture replacement, and image enhancements; we demonstrate that such approaches can significantly improve individual model effectiveness. Additionally, we test different strategies for combining the evaluated models to achieve results superior to those obtained individually, reaching an F1-score of 80.41%, a value comparable to other recent works in the literature.

TL;DR: CVP is a multimodal spatial reasoning framework inspired by human central and peripheral vision, achieving SOTA on 3D scene understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely on unstructured representations (point clouds, voxels, patch features) with implicit scene context via coordinate embeddings, resulting in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding.

Method: Introduces two complementary components in a Large Multimodal Model: target-affinity token (analogous to central vision) that guides attention to query-relevant objects, and allocentric grid (akin to peripheral vision) that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements.

Result: CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: The central-peripheral vision-inspired framework enables structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments through explicit high-level structural components.

Abstract: We present a central-peripheral vision-inspired framework (CVP), a simple yet effective multimodal model for spatial reasoning that draws inspiration from the two types of human visual fields -- central vision and peripheral vision. Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.

### [15] [Fourier-RWKV: A Multi-State Perception Network for Efficient Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08161)
*Lirong Zheng,Yanshan Li,Rui Yu,Kaihao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fourier-RWKV is a novel image dehazing framework that uses Multi-State Perception with linear complexity, combining spatial, frequency, and semantic perception for efficient non-uniform haze removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception but remains challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Transformer-based methods capture global context well but have quadratic computational complexity that hinders real-time deployment.

Method: Proposes Fourier-RWKV framework based on Multi-State Perception paradigm: (1) Spatial-form Perception via Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) for local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception via Fourier Mix block extending RWKV's WKV attention to Fourier domain for long-range dependencies; (3) Semantic-relation Perception via Semantic Bridge Module with Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion for encoder-decoder alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

Conclusion: Fourier-RWKV delivers comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity, achieving superior dehazing performance with practical efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception, yet it remains highly challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

### [16] [Accuracy Does Not Guarantee Human-Likeness in Monocular Depth Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08163)
*Yuki Kubota,Taiki Fukiage*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity in monocular depth estimation, finding that improving accuracy doesn't necessarily lead to more human-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether there's a trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior in monocular depth estimation, similar to what's observed in object recognition, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks use sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates.

Method: Systematically investigated 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset, applying affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components on a factor-by-factor basis.

Result: While humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), distinct trade-off relationships exist between model accuracy and human similarity, indicating improving accuracy doesn't necessarily lead to more human-like behavior.

Conclusion: There's a need for developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluation metrics beyond traditional accuracy to better align depth estimation models with human perception for improved robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is a fundamental capability for real-world applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved superhuman accuracy on physical-based benchmarks, a key challenge remains: aligning model representations with human perception, a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness and interpretability. Research in object recognition has revealed a complex trade-off between model accuracy and human-like behavior, raising a question whether a similar divergence exist in depth estimation, particularly for natural outdoor scenes where benchmarks rely on sensor-based ground truth rather than human perceptual estimates. In this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between model accuracy and human similarity across 69 monocular depth estimators using the KITTI dataset. To dissect the structure of error patterns on a factor-by-factor basis, we applied affine fitting to decompose prediction errors into interpretable components. Intriguingly, our results reveal while humans and DNNs share certain estimation biases (positive error correlations), we observed distinct trade-off relationships between model accuracy and human similarity. This finding indicates that improving accuracy does not necessarily lead to more human-like behavior, underscoring the necessity of developing multifaceted, human-centric evaluations beyond traditional accuracy.

*Xiaojing Wei,Ting Zhang,Wei He,Jingdong Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLoom is a novel framework for text-to-geometric-diagram generation that uses formal language translation and Monte Carlo optimization to ensure spatial accuracy and structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality geometric diagram generation requires strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints. Current methods lack the precision needed for geometric domains, and there's an opportunity to leverage formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability.

Method: GeoLoom has two core components: 1) an autoformalization module that translates natural language into GeoLingua (a generation-oriented formal language), and 2) a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using Monte Carlo optimization. The framework is supported by GeoNF dataset and uses constraint-based evaluation metrics.

Result: GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

Conclusion: GeoLoom offers a novel approach to geometric diagram generation that combines formal language translation with optimization techniques, achieving superior structural accuracy and establishing a foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation systems.

Abstract: High-quality geometric diagram generation presents both a challenge and an opportunity: it demands strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints to guide generation. Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

*Yubo Chen,Di Zhao,Yun Sing Koh,Talia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for running animal re-identification on low-power microcontroller devices by designing compact CNN models and efficient fine-tuning strategies for real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable wildlife monitoring and livestock management in remote outdoor environments with limited connectivity by running animal re-identification directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes, overcoming the limitations of large models designed for workstations/servers.

Method: 1) Analyze gap between state-of-the-art models and MCU hardware constraints; 2) Design compact Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs; 3) Develop data-efficient fine-tuning strategy requiring only 3 images per animal identity for fast adaptation to new sites.

Result: Compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy across 6 public datasets while reducing model size by over 100x. On self-collected cattle dataset, deployed model performs fully on-device inference with minimal accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy compared to cluster version.

Conclusion: Practical, adaptable Animal Re-ID is achievable on MCU-class devices, enabling scalable deployment in real field environments for wildlife monitoring and precision livestock management.

Abstract: Camera-based animal re-identification (Animal Re-ID) can support wildlife monitoring and precision livestock management in large outdoor environments with limited wireless connectivity. In these settings, inference must run directly on collar tags or low-power edge nodes built around microcontrollers (MCUs), yet most Animal Re-ID models are designed for workstations or servers and are too large for devices with small memory and low-resolution inputs. We propose an on-device framework. First, we characterise the gap between state-of-the-art Animal Re-ID models and MCU-class hardware, showing that straightforward knowledge distillation from large teachers offers limited benefit once memory and input resolution are constrained. Second, guided by this analysis, we design a high-accuracy Animal Re-ID architecture by systematically scaling a CNN-based MobileNetV2 backbone for low-resolution inputs. Third, we evaluate the framework with a real-world dataset and introduce a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy to enable fast adaptation with just three images per animal identity at a new site. Across six public Animal Re-ID datasets, our compact model achieves competitive retrieval accuracy while reducing model size by over two orders of magnitude. On a self-collected cattle dataset, the deployed model performs fully on-device inference with only a small accuracy drop and unchanged Top-1 accuracy relative to its cluster version. We demonstrate that practical, adaptable Animal Re-ID is achievable on MCU-class devices, paving the way for scalable deployment in real field environments.

### [19] [VisKnow: Constructing Visual Knowledge Base for Object Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08221)
*Ziwei Yao,Qiyang Wan,Ruiping Wang,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes VisKnow, a framework for constructing Visual Knowledge Bases that structure multi-modal object knowledge as graphs to advance comprehensive object understanding beyond simple recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object understanding in computer vision is limited to simple category recognition, lacking comprehensive perception of object components, attributes, relationships, and contextual knowledge. Existing multi-modal data is task-oriented and not systematically organized enough for deep object understanding.

Method: The authors propose VisKnow framework that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge and structures it as graphs. It integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through expert design and large-scale model application. They demonstrate this with AnimalKB, covering 406 animal categories with 22K textual triplets, 420K images, and region annotations.

Result: AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks like zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Experiments show the framework's effectiveness in advancing visual understanding.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and practical applications, providing a systematic approach to organizing multi-modal object knowledge beyond simple recognition tasks.

Abstract: Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

*Md Eimran Hossain Eimon,Ashan Perera,Juan Merlos,Velibor Adzic,Hari Kalva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes using VVC video codec for compressing neural network features in split inference systems, proposing three optimized VVC profiles that balance compression efficiency and encoding speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs are optimized for human perception, but in split inference systems where neural network features are transmitted instead of pixels, perceptual fidelity becomes irrelevant. There's a need for efficient compression of abstract, sparse, task-specific features.

Method: The authors investigate VVC for feature compression under MPEG-AI FCM standard, perform tool-level analysis to understand impact of coding components, and propose three lightweight VVC profiles (Fast, Faster, Fastest) based on these insights.

Result: The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain with 21.8% encoding time reduction. Faster achieves 1.85% BD-Rate gain with 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only 1.71% BD-Rate loss.

Conclusion: VVC can be effectively adapted for neural feature compression in split inference systems, with significant speed improvements achievable through optimized profiles while maintaining good compression efficiency.

Abstract: Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.

*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Xiaoyang Guo,Sidi Liu,Qinhan Lv,Ruiqi Chen,Jing Yang,Yijia Fan,Xiaofei Sun,Jian Wang,Ziliang Chen,Liang Lin,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-CoT is a diagnostic benchmark that evaluates multimodal models' Chain-of-Thought reasoning by testing visual grounding and logical coherence through constraint-based event chain selection rather than free-form generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal models focus on generation but neglect verification - the ability to assess whether reasoning chains are visually consistent and logically valid. There's a need to determine if CoT reasoning is genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent.

Method: MM-CoT requires models to select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (1) visual consistency (anchored in observable evidence) and (2) logical coherence (causal and commonsense validity). Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints to expose distinct reasoning failures.

Result: Leading vision-language models struggle on MM-CoT, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. The benchmark shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning.

Conclusion: MM-CoT provides a foundation for developing future multimodal models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world, addressing the critical gap between generative capability and genuine reasoning quality.

Abstract: The ability to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning marks a major milestone for multimodal models (MMs), enabling them to solve complex visual reasoning problems. Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world.

### [23] [Geometry-Aware Sparse Depth Sampling for High-Fidelity RGB-D Depth Completion in Robotic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08229)
*Tony Salloom,Dandi Zhou,Xinhai Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy for depth completion that generates more realistic sparse depth inputs by considering geometry-dependent reliability, improving accuracy and reducing artifacts compared to uniform random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth completion methods use unrealistic sparse depth generation by uniformly sampling from ground truth, ignoring that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially non-uniform reliability patterns.

Method: Proposes a PCA-based surface normal estimation on RGB-D point clouds to compute per-pixel depth reliability measures, then samples sparse depth according to this reliability distribution rather than uniformly.

Result: Experiments on NYU Depth v2 show improved accuracy, reduced artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware sparse depth sampling produces more realistic training data for depth completion models, leading to better performance and more accurate depth maps that better handle real-world sensor limitations.

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.

TL;DR: Progressive reparameterization using Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers to compress multimodal language models while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal language models are computationally heavy due to large parameter requirements for aligning visual features with linguistic representations, making them difficult to deploy efficiently.

Method: Progressive reparameterization strategy that gradually replaces dense feed-forward network blocks with compact PHM layers, using residual interpolation schedule with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses.

Result: Substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. Maintains comparable performance to base models with significant reductions in model size and inference latency.

Conclusion: Progressive PHM substitution offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLLMs) require large parameter capacity to align high-dimensional visual features with linguistic representations, making them computationally heavy and difficult to deploy efficiently. We introduce a progressive reparameterization strategy that compresses these models by gradually replacing dense feed-forward network blocks with compact Parameterized Hypercomplex Multiplication (PHM) layers. A residual interpolation schedule, together with lightweight reconstruction and knowledge distillation losses, ensures that the PHM modules inherit the functional behavior of their dense counterparts during training. This transition yields substantial parameter and FLOP reductions while preserving strong multimodal alignment, enabling faster inference without degrading output quality. We evaluate the approach on multiple vision-language models (VLMs). Our method maintains performance comparable to the base models while delivering significant reductions in model size and inference latency. Progressive PHM substitution thus offers an architecture-compatible path toward more efficient multimodal reasoning and complements existing low-bit quantization techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastBEV++ is a camera-only BEV perception framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.359 NDS on nuScenes) with exceptional real-time speed (134 FPS on Tesla T4) by eliminating custom CUDA kernels and using only TensorRT-native operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current camera-only BEV perception faces a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and deployment tractability due to computationally prohibitive view transformations and platform-specific kernels that hinder real-world automotive deployment.

Method: Introduces two principles: 1) "Deployable by Design" via novel view transformation that decomposes monolithic projection into standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline using deterministic pre-sorting, enabling TensorRT-native portability without custom CUDA kernels; 2) "Fast by Algorithm" with end-to-end depth-aware fusion, temporal aggregation, and robust data augmentation to enhance geometric fidelity.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS on nuScenes benchmark while maintaining exceptional real-time performance exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (Tesla T4), demonstrating both high accuracy and deployment efficiency.

Conclusion: FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems by offering a solution free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, reconciling the tension between performance and deployment tractability in camera-only BEV perception.

Abstract: The advancement of camera-only Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) perception is currently impeded by a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and on-vehicle deployment tractability. This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the "Deployable by Design" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is "Fast by Algorithm", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose-based end-to-end model for sign language spotting that detects query signs in continuous sequences using pose keypoints instead of RGB frames, achieving 61.88% accuracy on WSLP 2025 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unexplored problem of sign-to-sign retrieval (Sign Language Spotting) to bridge communication gap between deaf and hearing communities, moving beyond traditional gloss recognition approaches.

Method: End-to-end model using pose keypoints extracted from sign videos with encoder-only backbone and binary classification head to detect presence/absence of query signs in target sequences.

Result: Achieved 61.88% accuracy and 60.00% F1-score on Word Presence Prediction dataset from WSLP 2025 shared task, demonstrating effectiveness of pose-based approach.

Conclusion: Pose-based framework effectively reduces computational cost and visual noise, establishing foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTC-VLM is a hybrid vision-language model that uses dual channels (continuous for fine details, discrete for semantic anchors) to achieve 580-to-1 compression while maintaining 87.2% performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VLMs face quadratic computational costs from feeding visual patches to LLMs, creating a trade-off between continuous compression (loses semantics) and discrete quantization (loses fine details).

Method: Hybrid framework with dual channels: continuous pathway using ViT patches for fine-grained details, and discrete pathway using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens for symbolic anchors. These are fused into 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into single voco token via disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck.

Result: Achieves 87.2% average performance retention across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming leading continuous baseline at 81.0% with 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analysis shows compressed token prioritizes discrete anchor.

Conclusion: Minimalist hybrid design resolves efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advances scalable VLMs by maintaining both semantic guidance and fine-grained details through disentangled representation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal reasoning, but feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs incurs quadratic computational costs, straining memory and context windows. Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs.

*Saeeda Naz,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net framework combining CNN and Transformer blocks achieves state-of-the-art breast lesion segmentation on BUSI dataset with 99.29% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in breast ultrasound lesion segmentation by extracting both local correlated features and global dependencies while handling ultrasound noise and maintaining morphological integrity of malignant lesions.

Method: Proposes a deep hybrid framework combining residual CNN modules for local features and customized Swin Transformer blocks for global dependencies. Uses Laplacian-of-Gaussian for tissue continuity and noise suppression, boundary-oriented operator for contour integrity, contraction strategy for scale invariance, MSCAS module for multi-scale attention, and Pixel-Attention module for spatial weighting.

Result: Outperforms existing CNNs/ViTs on BUSI dataset with 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice score for breast lesion segmentation.

Conclusion: The Residual-SwinCA-Net framework significantly improves BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and supports timely clinical decision-making for breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: A novel deep hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net segmentation framework is proposed in the study for addressing such challenges by extracting locally correlated and robust features, incorporating residual CNN modules. Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making.

*Haowen Zheng,Hu Zhu,Lu Deng,Weihao Gu,Yang Yang,Yanyan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTKD is a knowledge distillation method that transfers future frame knowledge from offline to online 3D object detection models using sparse queries, improving accuracy without increasing inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods for camera-based 3D object detection overlook future frames, focusing only on spatial features or temporal relations, making it hard for online models to learn future knowledge from offline teachers.

Method: Proposes Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD) with: 1) future-aware feature reconstruction using sparse queries to capture future features without strict frame alignment, and 2) future-guided logit distillation leveraging teacher's stable foreground/background context.

Result: Achieves up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on nuScenes dataset, plus most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost when applied to two high-performing 3D detection baselines.

Conclusion: FTKD effectively transfers future knowledge from offline to online models, addressing limitations of existing KD methods and improving 3D object detection performance in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.

*YiLin Zhou,Lili Wei,Zheming Xu,Ziyi Chen,Congyan Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QHP introduces query-aware hub prototypes for few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation, addressing prototype bias by modeling support-query correlations and refining prototypes through purity-reweighted contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from support sets without considering query relevance, causing prototype bias that overfits support characteristics and fails to generalize to query distributions, especially with distribution shifts.

Method: Proposes Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning with two modules: 1) Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) constructs bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs to generate query-relevant prototypes; 2) Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) uses purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototypes by pulling bad hubs and outliers toward class centers.

Result: Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet show QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

Conclusion: QHP successfully addresses prototype bias in few-shot 3D segmentation by explicitly modeling support-query correlations and optimizing prototype distributions, leading to improved generalization across distribution shifts.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-3DSeg) aims to segment novel classes with only a few labeled samples. However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

### [31] [SFP: Real-World Scene Recovery Using Spatial and Frequency Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08254)
*Yun Liu,Tao Li,Cosmin Ancuti,Wenqi Ren,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFP (Spatial and Frequency Priors) is a novel scene recovery method that combines spatial and frequency domain priors to handle multiple degradations in real-world scenarios without complex networks or synthetic training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene recovery methods are insufficient because they either rely on single priors that can't handle multiple degradations, or use complex networks trained on synthetic data that generalize poorly to diverse real-world scenarios.

Method: The method uses spatial priors (inverse degraded image projection resembles scene transmission) to estimate transmission maps, and frequency priors (DC component similarity and low-frequency magnitude distribution) to construct adaptive frequency enhancement masks. A weighted fusion strategy integrates spatial restoration, frequency enhancement, and salient input features.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions, showing improved performance over existing methods.

Conclusion: SFP provides an effective solution for real-world scene recovery by leveraging complementary spatial and frequency priors, avoiding the limitations of single-prior methods and complex synthetic-trained networks.

Abstract: Scene recovery serves as a critical task for various computer vision applications. Existing methods typically rely on a single prior, which is inherently insufficient to handle multiple degradations, or employ complex network architectures trained on synthetic data, which suffer from poor generalization for diverse real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Spatial and Frequency Priors (SFP) for real-world scene recovery. In the spatial domain, we observe that the inverse of the degraded image exhibits a projection along its spectral direction that resembles the scene transmission. Leveraging this spatial prior, the transmission map is estimated to recover the scene from scattering degradation. In the frequency domain, a mask is constructed for adaptive frequency enhancement, with two parameters estimated using our proposed novel priors. Specifically, one prior assumes that the mean intensity of the degraded image's direct current (DC) components across three channels in the frequency domain closely approximates that of each channel in the clear image. The second prior is based on the observation that, for clear images, the magnitude of low radial frequencies below 0.001 constitutes approximately 1% of the total spectrum. Finally, we design a weighted fusion strategy to integrate spatial-domain restoration, frequency-domain enhancement, and salient features from the input image, yielding the final recovered result. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed SFP for scene recovery under various degradation conditions.

TL;DR: EgoX is a novel framework that generates realistic egocentric (first-person) videos from single exocentric (third-person) inputs using adapted video diffusion models with geometry-guided attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enable immersive understanding by translating third-person videos into first-person perspectives, which is challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap between perspectives.

Method: EgoX leverages pretrained video diffusion models with lightweight LoRA adaptation, uses unified conditioning combining exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel concatenation, and implements geometry-guided self-attention for spatial relevance.

Result: The approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation with strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

Conclusion: EgoX successfully addresses the challenging task of exocentric-to-egocentric video translation through innovative conditioning strategies and geometry-aware attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVAS introduces physics-aware video-to-audio synthesis using physical parameter estimation and a physics-driven adapter to generate more realistic sounds based on object mass and motion, outperforming appearance-only V2A models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current V2A models are appearance-driven and lack consideration of physical factors that shape real-world sounds, limiting their realism and physical plausibility.

Method: Uses a Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter) with physical parameters estimated by a Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE) that employs a VLM for mass inference and segmentation-based 3D reconstruction for motion trajectory and velocity computation.

Result: PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the VGG-Impact benchmark using the Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC) metric.

Conclusion: Incorporating physical reasoning into V2A synthesis significantly improves audio realism and physical consistency, demonstrating the importance of modeling underlying physical factors in sound generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality and temporal synchronization, yet most models remain appearance-driven, capturing visual-acoustic correlations without considering the physical factors that shape real-world sounds. We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: OpenSubject introduces a large-scale video-derived dataset (2.5M samples, 4.35M images) with a four-stage pipeline for subject-driven image generation and manipulation, improving performance in complex multi-subject scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subject-driven image generation models often deviate from reference identities and struggle with complex scenes containing multiple subjects, creating a need for better training data and methods.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: 1) Video curation with resolution/aesthetic filtering, 2) Cross-frame subject mining/pairing using VLM-based category consensus and diversity-aware pairing, 3) Identity-preserving reference image synthesis with segmentation map-guided outpainting and box-guided inpainting, 4) Verification and captioning with VLM validation and re-synthesis of failed samples.

Result: Training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes, as demonstrated through extensive experiments evaluating identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency.

Conclusion: OpenSubject provides a high-quality, large-scale dataset that addresses limitations in subject-driven generation, enabling better identity preservation and performance in complex multi-subject scenarios through its carefully designed pipeline.

Abstract: Despite the promising progress in subject-driven image generation, current models often deviate from the reference identities and struggle in complex scenes with multiple subjects. To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips. (ii) Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing. We utilize vision-language model (VLM)-based category consensus, local grounding, and diversity-aware pairing to select image pairs. (iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions. In addition, we introduce a benchmark covering subject-driven generation and manipulation, and then evaluate identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency with a VLM judge. Extensive experiments show that training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoDM: A geometry-aware distribution matching framework for dataset distillation that operates in product spaces of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds to capture diverse data structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods are limited to Euclidean spaces, which only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data (e.g., curvature). High-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, so distilled data should align with the original data manifold geometry.

Method: Proposes GeoDM framework operating in Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds. Introduces learnable curvature and weight parameters for each geometry type. Designs optimal transport loss to enhance distribution fidelity. Theoretical analysis shows geometry-aware distribution matching yields smaller generalization error bound.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that GeoDM outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for single geometries.

Conclusion: GeoDM provides a unified geometry-aware framework for dataset distillation that captures diverse data structures (flat, hierarchical, cyclical) and achieves superior performance compared to Euclidean-only approaches.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact subset of the original data, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large dataset. Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.

TL;DR: GeoDiffMM is a diffusion-based Lagrangian video motion magnification framework that uses optical flow as geometric conditioning to amplify subtle motions while suppressing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Eulerian VMM approaches struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small, despite using decoupling representation learning techniques.

Method: Three main components: 1) Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise for supervision; 2) Diffusion Motion Magnifier conditions denoising on optical flow geometry prior and learnable magnification factor; 3) Flow-based Video Synthesis maps amplified motion back to image domain.

Result: Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification quality.

Conclusion: GeoDiffMM successfully addresses the noise-separation challenge in VMM by leveraging diffusion models with geometric conditioning, enabling structurally consistent motion amplification while suppressing irrelevant perturbations.

Abstract: Video Motion Magnification (VMM) amplifies subtle macroscopic motions to a perceptible level. Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.

*Michael R. Martin,Garrick Chan,Kwan-Liu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper provides a systematic explainable AI analysis of image protection mechanisms (Glaze and Nightshade), revealing they operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains, rather than inducing global semantic drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While empirical effectiveness of image protection mechanisms like Glaze and Nightshade is known, their internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior remain poorly understood, creating a need for systematic analysis.

Method: Uses a unified framework integrating white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing, including latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization.

Result: Protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content; protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure; detectability governed by perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment; sequential protection amplifies detectable structure; Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes.

Conclusion: Contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable; advances interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs future defense and detection strategies.

Abstract: Recent image protection mechanisms such as Glaze and Nightshade introduce imperceptible, adversarially designed perturbations intended to disrupt downstream text-to-image generative models. While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.

TL;DR: MELLA dataset improves MLLM performance for low-resource languages by addressing both linguistic capability and cultural groundedness through dual-source data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual enhancement methods for MLLMs are limited to text modality or machine translation, neglecting multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively.

Method: Proposed dual-source strategy: 1) native web alt-text for cultural groundedness, 2) MLLM-generated captions for linguistic capability. Implemented as MELLA multimodal multilingual dataset.

Result: Fine-tuning on MELLA shows general performance improvement for eight languages across various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions" instead of "thin descriptions".

Conclusion: MELLA dataset successfully bridges the gap in low-resource language MLLMs by enhancing both cultural knowledge and linguistic capability, verified through experimental results.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement. Our dataset can be found at https://opendatalab.com/applyMultilingualCorpus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointDico is a novel 3D representation learning model that integrates diffusion and contrastive learning through knowledge distillation to overcome limitations of existing methods in handling unordered point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised methods struggle with 3D data due to its unordered and uneven density. Contrastive models suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders have difficulty handling unordered point clouds. The authors aim to combine the strengths of diffusion and contrastive models.

Method: PointDico integrates denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model guides the contrastive model. It uses a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and a dual-channel design to integrate local and global contextual information.

Result: PointDico achieves state-of-the-art performance: 94.32% accuracy on ScanObjectNN and 86.5% instance mIoU on ShapeNetPart.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of diffusion and contrastive learning through knowledge distillation effectively addresses the challenges of 3D representation learning, setting new benchmarks for 3D point cloud understanding tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has shown significant improvement in Natural Language Processing and 2D Computer Vision. However, existing methods face difficulties in representing 3D data because of its unordered and uneven density. Through an in-depth analysis of mainstream contrastive and generative approaches, we find that contrastive models tend to suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders struggle to handle unordered point clouds. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of diffusion and contrast models, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose \textit{PointDico}, a novel model that seamlessly integrates these methods. \textit{PointDico} learns from both denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model serves as a guide for the contrastive model. We introduce a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and employ a dual-channel design to effectively integrate local and global contextual information. \textit{PointDico} achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, \textit{e.g.}, \textbf{94.32\%} accuracy on ScanObjectNN, \textbf{86.5\%} Inst. mIoU on ShapeNetPart.

*Xianghong Xiao,Zeyu Xia,Zhou Fei,Jinliang Xiao,Haorui Chen,Liangjian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi²MAC is a novel adaptive convolution method for pansharpening that uses bimodal masks to intelligently route heterogeneous and redundant features to separate processing branches, achieving SOTA performance with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning pansharpening methods struggle with regional heterogeneity in remote sensing images. While adaptive convolution methods exist, they suffer from high computational costs and limited ability to effectively capture heterogeneous regions.

Method: Proposes Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi²MAC) with a lightweight mask generation module that creates both soft and hard masks. Soft masks modulate input features, while hard masks guide different region types into separate branches: redundant features go to a compact branch for low-cost global processing, and heterogeneous features go to a focused branch for fine-grained modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show Bi²MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring substantially lower training time, fewer parameters, and minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

Conclusion: Bi²MAC effectively addresses regional heterogeneity in pansharpening by intelligently allocating computational resources to different region types, achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead compared to existing adaptive convolution methods.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian splatting methods for rendering complex reflections face bottlenecks in rendering speed and memory storage, especially for photorealistic novel view synthesis of reflective scenes.

Method: Proposes HybridSplat with reflection-baked Gaussian tracing that bakes view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive, integrates reflective and base primitives using unified hybrid splatting framework, and adds pipeline-level acceleration with reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning.

Result: Achieves 7x faster rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF and NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than ray-tracing based baselines while preserving reflection quality.

Conclusion: HybridSplat establishes a new state-of-the-art method for complex reflective scenes by significantly improving rendering speed and reducing memory storage while maintaining high-fidelity reflection rendering quality.

Abstract: Rendering complex reflection of real-world scenes using 3D Gaussian splatting has been a quite promising solution for photorealistic novel view synthesis, but still faces bottlenecks especially in rendering speed and memory storage. This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover missing BOLD fMRI information when BOLD images are corrupted or unavailable, enabling downstream tasks by generating BOLD images from more commonly available T1-weighted structural MRI.

Method: Uses a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder to extract within-slice structural representations, a slice-attention module for cross-slice contextual fusion, a multi-scale generation decoder for fine-grained functional contrast restoration, and DINO-based perceptual loss for structural/textural consistency.

Result: Outperforms conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects, demonstrating the first framework capable of generating mean BOLD images directly from T1w images.

Conclusion: The approach highlights the potential of self-supervised transformer guidance for structural-to-functional mapping in neuroimaging, offering a promising solution for BOLD image recovery when original data is unavailable.

Abstract: Generating BOLD images from T1w images offers a promising solution for recovering missing BOLD information and enabling downstream tasks when BOLD images are corrupted or unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose DINO-BOLDNet, a DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder with a lightweight trainable decoder. The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. To our knowledge, this is the first framework capable of generating mean BOLD images directly from T1w images, highlighting the potential of self-supervised transformer guidance for structural-to-functional mapping.

TL;DR: TrackingWorld: A novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels in world-centric coordinates from monocular video, addressing camera motion separation and tracking of newly emerging dynamic subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular 3D tracking methods fail to properly separate camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in videos.

Method: Three-step pipeline: 1) Tracking upsampler lifts sparse 2D tracks to dense 2D tracks, 2) Generalization to newly emerging objects by applying upsampler to all frames and eliminating redundancy in overlapped regions, 3) Optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating camera poses and 3D coordinates.

Result: Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

Conclusion: TrackingWorld successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by enabling dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric coordinate system from monocular video.

Abstract: Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

*Bozhou Li,Xinda Xue,Sihan Yang,Yang Shi,Xinlong Chen,Yushuo Guan,Yuanxing Zhang,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies a norm disparity problem in MLLMs' Pre-Norm architecture causing asymmetric update dynamics between visual and text tokens, proposes adding a LayerNorm after the visual projector to align norms, and shows performance gains on multimodal and text-only benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs using Pre-Norm architecture suffer from severe norm disparity between high-norm visual tokens and low-norm text tokens, creating asymmetric update dynamics that impair cross-modal feature fusion.

Method: Theoretical analysis of norm disparity and asymmetric update dynamics, followed by empirical validation across mainstream MLLMs. Proposed solution: insert a single carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment.

Result: Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 show significant performance gains on multimodal benchmarks and text-only evaluations (MMLU), demonstrating that resolving architectural imbalance leads to more holistically capable models.

Conclusion: Norm disparity in MLLMs causes asymmetric update dynamics that hinder cross-modal fusion; a simple LayerNorm intervention effectively aligns norms and improves both multimodal and unimodal performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which couple pre-trained vision encoders and language models, have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.

*Jing Tao,You Li,Banglei Guan,Yang Shang,Qifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for simultaneous image enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions using gradient-domain weighted guided filtering, Retinex decomposition, and multi-exposure fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Images captured under challenging light conditions suffer from degradations that reduce vision-based application performance. Existing methods either amplify noise excessively or only work under specific illumination conditions.

Method: 1) Use gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) for illumination estimation and quality improvement. 2) Apply Retinex model to decompose image into illumination and reflection layers. 3) Process layers in parallel: correct illumination layer and enhance reflection layer. 4) Optimize dynamic range through multi-exposure fusion and linear stretching.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows the proposed method achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Under challenging light conditions, captured images often suffer from various degradations, leading to a decline in the performance of vision-based applications. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.

Conclusion: Facial retouching detection is crucial for biometric security, and leveraging beauty assessment algorithms with AI-based feature extraction can effectively detect retouched images even when the specific retouching method is unknown.

Abstract: Facial retouching to beautify images is widely spread in social media, advertisements, and it is even applied in professional photo studios to let individuals appear younger, remove wrinkles and skin impurities. Generally speaking, this is done to enhance beauty. This is not a problem itself, but when retouched images are used as biometric samples and enrolled in a biometric system, it is one. Since previous work has proven facial retouching to be a challenge for face recognition systems,the detection of facial retouching becomes increasingly necessary. This work proposes to study and analyze changes in beauty assessment algorithms of retouched images, assesses different feature extraction methods based on artificial intelligence in order to improve retouching detection, and evaluates whether face beauty can be exploited to enhance the detection rate. In a scenario where the attacking retouching algorithm is unknown, this work achieved 1.1% D-EER on single image detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of processing large volumes of video data from Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems in fisheries management, which exceeds manual review capacity, requiring automated solutions for fish re-identification.

Method: The method involves developing an optimized deep learning pipeline using the AutoFish dataset (simulating EM systems with conveyor belts), employing hard triplet mining with custom image transformation pipeline including dataset-specific normalization, and comparing Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture against CNN-based ResNet-50.

Result: Results show Swin-T consistently outperforms ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. Analysis reveals the primary challenge is intra-species errors where viewpoint inconsistency is more detrimental than partial occlusion.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that optimized deep learning pipelines with hard triplet mining and custom transformations can effectively automate fish re-identification for EM systems, with Vision Transformers showing superior performance over traditional CNNs for this task.

Abstract: Accurate fisheries data are crucial for effective and sustainable marine resource management. With the recent adoption of Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems, more video data is now being collected than can be feasibly reviewed manually. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an optimized deep learning pipeline for automated fish re-identification (Re-ID) using the novel AutoFish dataset, which simulates EM systems with conveyor belts with six similarly looking fish species. We demonstrate that key Re-ID metrics (R1 and mAP@k) are substantially improved by using hard triplet mining in conjunction with a custom image transformation pipeline that includes dataset-specific normalization. By employing these strategies, we demonstrate that the Vision Transformer-based Swin-T architecture consistently outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network-based ResNet-50, achieving peak performance of 41.65% mAP@k and 90.43% Rank-1 accuracy. An in-depth analysis reveals that the primary challenge is distinguishing visually similar individuals of the same species (Intra-species errors), where viewpoint inconsistency proves significantly more detrimental than partial occlusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-based HMR methods like SAM 3D Body work well on single images but suffer from temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions when applied to videos due to per-frame inference.

Method: Proposes SAM-Body4D: 1) generates identity-consistent masklets using promptable video segmentation, 2) refines them with Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions, 3) uses refined masklets to guide SAM 3D Body for consistent mesh trajectories, and 4) employs padding-based parallel strategy for efficient multi-human inference.

Result: Experimental results show improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos without any retraining, achieving better performance than per-frame methods.

Conclusion: SAM-Body4D effectively addresses temporal inconsistency and occlusion issues in video-based human mesh recovery through a training-free framework that leverages human continuity in videos, demonstrating practical applicability for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) aims to reconstruct 3D human pose and shape from 2D observations and is fundamental to human-centric understanding in real-world scenarios. While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to excessive memory overhead, limiting them to processing only a few frames. There's a need for efficient methods to handle hour-long videos while maintaining knowledge integrity and semantic coherence.

Method: Proposes One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG) with: 1) Query-guided video chunking algorithm that unifies clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one step, 2) Novel SynLongVideo dataset for training, 3) Progressive training regime to improve instruction following.

Conclusion: OneClip-RAG provides an effective and efficient solution for long-video understanding in MLLMs, addressing memory limitations while maintaining performance through intelligent retrieval augmentation and optimized processing.

Abstract: Due to excessive memory overhead, most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can only process videos of limited frames. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.

TL;DR: A depth-only 6D pose estimation method for cluttered bin-picking using multi-view depth fusion, staged heatmap attention, and sparse transformers with per-voxel voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D pose estimation in industrial bin-picking is challenging due to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts in densely packed environments.

Method: Holistic depth-only approach fusing multi-view depth maps into fine-grained 3D point clouds or sparse TSDF. Uses staged heatmap mechanism for scene-adaptive attention priors and density-aware sparse transformer blocks to handle occlusions and non-uniform 3D data distribution. Fully sparse framework with per-voxel voting strategy for simultaneous pose predictions.

Result: Validated on IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse 3D approach enables high-resolution volumetric representations for accurate pose estimation in clutter, operating fully sparse to capture fine geometric details crucial for robotic applications.

Abstract: Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LapFM is a surgical foundation model that uses hierarchical concept evolving pre-training on massive unlabeled laparoscopic images to achieve robust, granularity-adaptive segmentation across diverse surgical procedures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical segmentation approaches are limited by annotation scarcity and semantic inconsistency across procedures. Existing methods fine-tune natural foundation models with limited supervision, functioning as domain adapters rather than true surgical foundation models, struggling to generalize across surgical variability.

Method: LapFM uses Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training: 1) Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) with hierarchical mask decoder and parent-child query embeddings to unify diverse entities (Anatomy, Tissue, Instrument) into scalable knowledge structure; 2) Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images.

Result: The method creates LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark with 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments show LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

Conclusion: LapFM successfully bridges the gap in surgical segmentation by evolving robust capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images, moving beyond domain adaptation to become a true surgical foundation model that generalizes across diverse procedures and surgical targets.

Abstract: Surgical segmentation is pivotal for scene understanding yet remains hindered by annotation scarcity and semantic inconsistency across diverse procedures. Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

*Huiguo He,Pengyu Yan,Ziqi Yi,Weizhi Zhong,Zheng Liu,Yejun Tang,Huan Yang,Kun Gai,Guanbin Li,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ContextDrag is a new drag-based image editing method that leverages contextual information from reference images using noise-free feature injection and position-aware attention mechanisms to achieve better coherence and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based image editing methods fail to fully exploit contextual information from reference images, particularly fine-grained texture details, resulting in limited coherence and fidelity in edited images.

Method: ContextDrag introduces two key components: 1) Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features via Latent-space Reverse Mapping algorithm, and 2) Position-Consistent Attention (PCA) that re-encodes reference tokens with overlap-aware masking to eliminate irrelevant feature interference.

Result: Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that ContextDrag surpasses all existing state-of-the-art methods in drag-based image editing performance.

Conclusion: ContextDrag provides a new paradigm for drag-based editing that effectively leverages contextual modeling capabilities of editing models to achieve precise drag control while preserving semantic and texture consistency, without requiring finetuning or inversion.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified learning-based framework for color correction that jointly uses high-res RGB and low-res multispectral sensors in an end-to-end pipeline, improving color accuracy by up to 50% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current snapshot multispectral imaging enables compact spectral sensors for consumer devices, but existing methods treat color correction in separate stages and discard MS data early, missing opportunities for better color accuracy.

Method: Proposes a unified learning-based framework that performs end-to-end color correction by jointly leveraging data from high-resolution RGB and auxiliary low-resolution MS sensors, integrating the full pipeline within a single model. The framework is demonstrated by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. A dedicated dataset was constructed by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively integrates RGB and multispectral data for end-to-end color correction, demonstrating superior performance and flexibility across different architectures, with datasets, code, and models to be made available.

Abstract: Recent advances in snapshot multispectral (MS) imaging have enabled compact, low-cost spectral sensors for consumer and mobile devices. By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. Datasets, code, and models will be made available upon acceptance.

*Madhav Gupta,Vishak Prasad C,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an uncertainty-aware submodular subset selection framework to improve the robustness of deep vision model explanations under out-of-distribution conditions, addressing limitations of existing methods that degrade in OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current subset selection-based explanation methods for deep vision models work well in in-distribution settings but degrade significantly under out-of-distribution conditions, producing redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations that limit their real-world applicability.

Method: The proposed framework combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation. It estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection without requiring additional training or auxiliary models.

Result: Empirical evaluations show the framework mitigates weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios and also yields improvements in ID settings, producing more robust and reliable explanations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations of current subset-based explanation approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.

Abstract: Subset selection-based methods are widely used to explain deep vision models: they attribute predictions by highlighting the most influential image regions and support object-level explanations. While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.

*Jiaming Zhang,Che Wang,Yang Cao,Longtao Huang,Wei Yang Bryan Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReasonBreak is an adversarial framework that disrupts MLRMs' geographic location inference through concept-aware perturbations, achieving significant privacy protection improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal large reasoning models pose serious privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical reasoning, and existing privacy protection techniques are ineffective against these sophisticated reasoning processes.

Method: ReasonBreak uses concept-aware perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies to strategically target critical dependencies in reasoning chains, invalidating specific inference steps that cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. The approach is supported by GeoPrivacy-6K, a dataset of 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images with hierarchical concept annotations.

Result: Evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) shows ReasonBreak achieves 14.4% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8% vs 19.4%) and nearly doubles block-level protection (33.5% vs 16.8%).

Conclusion: ReasonBreak establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats by effectively disrupting hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through targeted concept-aware perturbations.

Abstract: Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose significant privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\% vs 19.4\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\% vs 16.8\%). This work establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight football player tracking method combining SAM for initialization with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based re-identification, achieving 7.6-7.7 FPS with good accuracy in crowded scenes but limited recovery for long-term occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Football player tracking faces challenges from frequent occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes, requiring robust yet efficient solutions.

Method: Team-aware tracking system using SAM for precise initialization, CSRT trackers for continuous tracking, and HSV histogram-based re-identification for occlusion recovery.

Result: Achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory (~1880 MB), 100% tracking success in light occlusions, 90% in crowded penalty-box scenarios, and 50% recovery of heavy occlusions, but only 8.66% re-acquisition for long-term occlusions.

Conclusion: SAM+CSRT combination provides consistent performance but struggles with long-term occlusions; classical trackers work well with continuous visibility but need stronger re-identification for extended absences.

Abstract: Football player tracking is challenged by frequent occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes. This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.

TL;DR: Proposes quaternion Wasserstein distance for color image generation, addressing channel correlation issues and improving GAN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing color image generation models ignore correlation among color channels, leading to chromatic aberration. Also lacks systematic theory for measuring color image datasets.

Method: Defines new quaternion Wasserstein distance with dual theory, solves quaternion linear programming using convex set separation theorem and Farkas lemma. Proposes Wasserstein quaternion GAN.

Result: Novel model surpasses both quaternion GANs and Wasserstein GANs in generation efficiency and image quality.

Conclusion: Quaternion Wasserstein distance effectively addresses color channel correlation and improves color image generation performance.

Abstract: Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.

*Yuna Kato,Shohei Mori,Hideo Saito,Yoshifumi Takatsume,Hiroki Kajita,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated surgical video alignment system that uses multiple cameras on shadowless lamps to generate unobstructed surgical field views by detecting lamp movements, realigning frames, and selecting least-occluded camera feeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical videos are essential for education/research but suffer from occlusion when surgeons block camera views. Existing multi-camera setups require manual post-processing alignment when surgeons move lamps for optimal lighting.

Method: Proposed method automatically detects when lighting system moves, realigns frames, selects camera with least occlusion, and generates consistent surgical field videos from fixed perspective. Includes multiple synthesis options for view generation.

Result: User study with surgeons showed videos generated by proposed method were superior to conventional methods in ease of confirming surgical area and viewing comfort. Also demonstrated improved video quality over existing techniques.

Conclusion: Fully automated alignment system successfully addresses occlusion issues in surgical video capture, providing superior educational/research videos through automated camera selection and frame realignment when lamps are moved.

Abstract: Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.

*Ada Gorgun,Fawaz Sammani,Nikos Deligiannis,Bernt Schiele,Jonas Fischer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCI is a training-free framework that analyzes when concepts form during diffusion model generation by measuring Concept Insertion Success across timesteps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation focuses on final outputs, but understanding the dynamic generation process is crucial for model reliability, controllability, and predictability. The paper aims to determine when noise transforms into specific concepts during denoising.

Method: Proposes Prompt-Conditioned Intervention (PCI) - a model-agnostic framework that analyzes Concept Insertion Success (CIS), measuring the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved in the final image.

Result: PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, showing certain phases are more favorable to specific concepts. Provides actionable insights for text-driven image editing with quantitatively stronger edits balancing semantic accuracy and content preservation.

Conclusion: PCI offers a novel way to analyze concept dynamics in diffusion models without model access or training, providing insights into generation processes and enabling more effective image editing interventions.

Abstract: Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

*Zhenyu Zhang,Guangyao Chen,Yixiong Zou,Zhimeng Huang,Yuhua Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's few-shot learning suffers from template-sample similarity bias, where models rely on template proximity rather than true category alignment. The paper introduces empty prompts to capture unbiased template features and a bias calibration loss to correct this bias, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify that CLIP's few-shot learning performance is compromised by template-sample similarity (TSS) bias, where the model learns to associate images with text templates based on their similarity rather than true category alignment. This bias reduces both classification accuracy and robustness across different benchmarks.

Method: The framework uses empty prompts (textual inputs conveying "emptiness" without category information) to capture unbiased template features. It operates in two stages: 1) During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder; 2) During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues rather than template proximity.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that the template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS bias. The approach yields higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness compared to baseline CLIP models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses template-sample similarity bias in CLIP's few-shot learning by using empty prompts and bias calibration. This leads to more reliable classification performance with improved accuracy and robustness across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of "emptiness" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing on-the-fly 3DGS methods for monocular RGB streams fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to limited field of view. Multi-camera rigs address this limitation but lack real-time reconstruction frameworks.

Method: Incremental fusion of dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into unified Gaussian representation. Features hierarchical camera initialization for coarse alignment without calibration, lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment, redundancy-free Gaussian sampling, and frequency-aware optimization scheduler.

Result: Reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the FOV limitation of monocular 3DGS methods by leveraging multi-camera rigs, achieving efficient, drift-free, and complete 3D scene reconstruction in real-time.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled efficient free-viewpoint rendering and photorealistic scene reconstruction. While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: A unified aerial VLN framework using only monocular RGB images and language instructions, achieving strong performance without panoramic or depth inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing aerial VLN methods require panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry, increasing system cost and complexity, which hinders practical deployment on lightweight UAVs.

Method: Formulates navigation as next-token prediction with prompt-guided multi-task learning; includes keyframe selection to reduce visual redundancy, and action merging with label reweighting to address supervision imbalance.

Result: Achieves strong results on Aerial VLN benchmark under monocular RGB-only setting, outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effective aerial VLN using only monocular RGB observations, making it more practical for lightweight UAV deployment.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments using onboard visual observation. This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the contribution of our task design and architectural choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conditional diffusion models suffer from misalignment and hallucinations, requiring expensive post-generation alignment assessment. The paper hypothesizes that misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time assessment without waiting for complete generation.

Method: Proposes NoisyCLIP, a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space during the reverse diffusion process. It uses dual encoders to detect prompt-to-latent misalignment early in image generation, enabling real-time alignment assessment.

Result: NoisyCLIP reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in Best-of-N settings. It enables real-time alignment assessment during generation without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Early detection of text-image misalignments during diffusion model generation is feasible and efficient. NoisyCLIP provides a practical solution for real-time alignment assessment, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining high alignment performance.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models rely on language-to-image alignment methods to steer the generation towards semantically accurate outputs. Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating individual fairness in skin lesion classification by treating skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than categorical, using kernel density estimation and statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities, and proposing a distance-based reweighting loss to address underrepresentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fairness research in medical imaging relies on coarse subgroup categories that overlook individual-level variations, risking obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, necessitating more nuanced fairness approaches.

Method: The study treats skin tone as a continuous attribute using kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. It compares twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and proposes a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones.

Result: Experiments across CNN and Transformer models show: (1) limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (2) superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS).

Conclusion: The findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems and highlight broader implications for handling sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis beyond categorical approaches.

Abstract: A major challenge in reconstructing buildings from LiDAR point clouds lies in accurately capturing building surfaces under varying point densities and noise interference. To flexibly gather high-quality 3D profiles of the building in diverse resolution, we propose OCCDiff applying latent diffusion in the occupancy function space. Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current thinking-with-images paradigms show strong visual reasoning but optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT through reinforcement learning is challenging due to scarce high-quality reasoning data.

Method: Proposes Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT) that reformulates iMCoT as language-only CoT with self-calling: main agent decomposes tasks into atomic subtasks and invokes parameter-sharing subagents in isolated context, using group-relative policy optimization.

Result: Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show sCoT improves overall reasoning performance by up to 1.9% with ~75% fewer GPU hours compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: sCoT offers a more efficient and effective paradigm for visual reasoning by avoiding explicit interleaving between modalities and leveraging self-calling with parameter-sharing subagents.

Abstract: Thinking-with-images paradigms have showcased remarkable visual reasoning capability by integrating visual information as dynamic elements into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\%$ with $\sim 75\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

TL;DR: MVP is a training-free framework that improves GUI grounding stability by aggregating predictions from multiple cropped views to address coordinate prediction instability in existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI grounding models suffer from significant coordinate prediction instability where minor visual perturbations can drastically alter predictions, undermining performance especially for high-resolution screens with small UI elements.

Method: Multi-View Prediction (MVP) framework with two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal that generates diverse views using instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering that ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster.

Result: MVP significantly boosts performance across various models on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark: UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Conclusion: MVP effectively addresses coordinate instability in GUI grounding through multi-view inference, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across different models without requiring additional training.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which translates natural language instructions into precise pixel coordinates, is essential for developing practical GUI agents. However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Conclusion: MatteViT provides a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal by effectively preserving fine-grained structural details while eliminating shadows, with demonstrated improvements in both visual quality and downstream task performance.

Abstract: Document shadow removal is essential for enhancing the clarity of digitized documents. Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing that combines reference images, hand-drawn sketches, and text prompts while maintaining consistent painting style through spatial alignment, semantic enhancement, and style transfer techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oil painting is challenging for digital generation/editing due to complex brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing methods are limited by training data distribution and focus mainly on modifying real photographs rather than creating artistic oil paintings.

Method: Three key technical advancements: 1) Enhanced training with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning (masks/sketches as spatial constraints, reference images/text as feature constraints), 2) Self-supervised style transfer pipeline using Stroke-Based Rendering to create large-scale paired training data, 3) AdaIN operator integration during inference for stylistic consistency.

Result: The interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil painting generation and editing as demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed unified multimodal framework successfully addresses the challenges of oil painting generation and editing by enabling precise semantic control through multiple input modalities while maintaining consistent painting style, representing a significant advancement in digital artistic creation.

Abstract: Oil painting, as a high-level medium that blends human abstract thinking with artistic expression, poses substantial challenges for digital generation and editing due to its intricate brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing.

TL;DR: Photo3D is a framework that enhances photorealistic 3D generation by using GPT-4o-Image generated images, addressing multi-view consistency issues through structure-aligned synthesis and detail enhancement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-native generators produce reliable geometry but lack realistic appearances due to scarcity of diverse, high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, which are difficult to capture due to scene scale diversity, object motions, and scanner limitations.

Method: Uses GPT-4o-Image generated images, creates structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline, builds detail-enhanced multi-view dataset, implements realistic detail enhancement with perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching, and provides training strategies for different 3D-native generation paradigms.

Result: Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

Conclusion: Photo3D effectively bridges the gap between 3D geometry generation and photorealistic appearance by leveraging image generation models while maintaining structural consistency, offering a generalizable solution for realistic 3D content creation.

Abstract: Although recent 3D-native generators have made great progress in synthesizing reliable geometry, they still fall short in achieving realistic appearances. A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms. Experiments demonstrate that Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require heavy computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. There's a need for efficient adaptation methods that maintain performance across domains without extensive retraining.

Method: Proposes Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters (T-DHA) that models vision-language relationships in hyperbolic space using Poincaré ball model instead of Euclidean space. Leverages hyperbolic space's exponential volume growth for better hierarchical data embedding. Combines with negative learning for improved classification with fewer feature dimensions.

Result: Extensive experiments show T-DHA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks across various datasets.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic space modeling effectively captures hierarchical vision-language relationships, enabling training-free adaptation that improves cross-domain performance and reduces computational requirements compared to traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Recent research in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced our capabilities in cross-modal reasoning. However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR-diffusion hybrid models combine structured AR modeling with photorealistic diffusion synthesis but suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising, creating a bottleneck for practical applications.

Method: 1) Entropy-informed speculative strategy aligns draft model's high-entropy representations with target model's entropy characteristics to reduce rejection rates. 2) Dynamic scheduler integrates diffusion into end-to-end framework, prioritizing AR optimization to guide diffusion. 3) Joint distillation combines trajectory and distribution matching for stable training with few steps. 4) Inference uses shallow feature entropy to pre-filter low-entropy drafts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art acceleration: 4.3× lossless speedup for TransDiff on ImageNet 256×256, and 3× acceleration for NextStep-1 on text-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: Fast-ARDiff successfully addresses latency bottlenecks in AR-diffusion hybrids through unified joint optimization, enabling efficient high-quality generation with significantly reduced computational overhead.

Abstract: Autoregressive(AR)-diffusion hybrid paradigms combine AR's structured modeling with diffusion's photorealistic synthesis, yet suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

Conclusion: InfiniteVL successfully addresses limitations of existing attention mechanisms in VLMs, providing linear complexity with competitive performance, efficient training, and practical advantages for long-sequence and streaming applications.

Abstract: Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion that avoids the computational costs of iterative methods while maintaining reconstruction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fixed-point iteration methods for diffusion inversion suffer from high computational costs due to iterative nature and complex hyperparameter selection, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: The authors derive an explicit fixed-point expression from ideal inversion, then introduce error approximation using calculable errors from previous steps to approximate unknown current errors, creating an unbiased low-variance estimator.

Result: The method achieves consistent and superior reconstruction performance on NOCAPS and MS-COCO datasets compared to DDIM inversion and other fixed-point iteration methods, without additional iterations or training.

Conclusion: The proposed iteration-free fixed-point estimator provides an efficient and effective solution for diffusion inversion, overcoming computational limitations of iterative approaches while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Diffusion inversion aims to recover the initial noise corresponding to a given image such that this noise can reconstruct the original image through the denoising diffusion process. The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training.

Conclusion: VALOR demonstrates that annotation-free training using AI-powered verifiers can effectively improve both reasoning and grounding in visual reasoning tasks, combining the strengths of modern language and vision models without requiring manual supervision.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is challenging, requiring both precise object grounding and understanding complex spatial relationships. Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels.

TL;DR: SSCATeR algorithm uses temporal data recycling and sparse scatter-based convolutions to process only changing regions in LiDAR streams, achieving 6.61x speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost of LiDAR object detection by focusing only on regions with changing point data between frames, exploiting temporal sparsity in continuous scanning.

Method: Uses sliding time window with short strides, stores convolution results between passes, extends scatter-based convolutions for data reuse, and treats LiDAR as continuous stream to process only changing parts.

Result: Achieves up to 6.61-fold reduction in processing time while producing identical feature maps to traditional sparse convolution techniques, with significant computational efficiency improvements.

Conclusion: SSCATeR enables efficient LiDAR object detection by exploiting temporal sparsity through data recycling, maintaining accuracy while dramatically reducing computational load.

Abstract: This work leverages the continuous sweeping motion of LiDAR scanning to concentrate object detection efforts on specific regions that receive a change in point data from one frame to another. We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.

TL;DR: Large-scale automated framework for discovering and explaining visual concept representations across human cortex using unsupervised decomposition and automated explanation generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts and where these representations are encoded remains challenging due to complex brain signals and vast visual concept space, with most studies being small-scale and lacking systematic validation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised data-driven decomposition methods; 2) Explain each pattern by identifying natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating natural-language descriptions of shared visual meaning, using automated pipeline with reliability scoring.

Result: Framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

Conclusion: The automated large-scale framework enables systematic discovery and explanation of visual representations across human cortex, overcoming limitations of traditional small-scale studies.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts, and in which brain regions these representations are encoded, remains a long-standing challenge. Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Astra is an interactive general world model for long-horizon video prediction across diverse scenarios (autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action control, using autoregressive denoising, temporal causal attention, and mixture of action experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While diffusion transformers enable high-quality video generation, world models that can predict long-term futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored for general-purpose scenarios and various action forms.

Method: Autoregressive denoising architecture with temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations; noise-augmented history memory to balance responsiveness and coherence; action-aware adapter for precise action control; mixture of action experts for handling heterogeneous action modalities.

Result: Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction supporting various interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets show improvements in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over state-of-the-art world models.

Conclusion: Astra bridges the gap in interactive general world models, enabling precise action-controlled long-horizon video prediction for diverse real-world tasks like exploration, manipulation, and camera control.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior neural ISP designs by introducing modularity for better control, scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles.

Method: A modular neural image signal processing framework that processes raw inputs through multiple intermediate stages with full control, enabling interactive photo-editing and unlimited post-editable re-rendering.

Result: Achieves competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets with moderate model sizes (0.5M to 3.9M parameters), and enables a user-interactive photo-editing tool for diverse operations and styles.

Conclusion: The modular neural ISP framework provides superior control, flexibility, and quality compared to prior designs, enabling practical applications like interactive photo editing while maintaining competitive performance with moderate computational requirements.

Abstract: This paper presents a modular neural image signal processing (ISP) framework that processes raw inputs and renders high-quality display-referred images. Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles. The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive pseudo-label adjustment for continual test-time adaptation in semantic segmentation, using class- and instance-aware thresholds to handle varying difficulty across classes and instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods use fixed or batch-level thresholds that cannot handle varying difficulty across classes and instances, which is especially problematic in semantic segmentation requiring dense multi-class predictions.

Method: Adaptively adjusts pseudo labels based on confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts, using fine-grained class- and instance-aware adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios (including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts) show consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art techniques, setting new standards for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed approach produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation, effectively addressing limitations of existing threshold-based methods in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) enables pre-trained models to adapt to continuously evolving domains. Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The tumor microenvironment contains valuable prognostic biomarkers, but existing methods fail to capture the complex interactions between different cell types needed for accurate survival prediction and risk stratification.

Method: HiGINE uses hierarchical graph neural networks to encode both local and global inter-relations in cell neighborhoods from mIF images, incorporating cell type and morphology information, with multimodal fusion of cancer stage and mIF-derived features.

Result: The model demonstrates improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability when validated on two public lung cancer datasets, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: HiGINE effectively leverages complex TME interactions for enhanced survival prediction in lung cancer, showing potential for clinical application in risk stratification.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising source of prognostic biomarkers. To fully leverage its potential, analysis methods must capture complex interactions between different cell types. We propose HiGINE -- a hierarchical graph-based approach to predict patient survival (short vs. long) from TME characterization in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images and enhance risk stratification in lung cancer. Our model encodes both local and global inter-relations in cell neighborhoods, incorporating information about cell types and morphology. Multimodal fusion, aggregating cancer stage with mIF-derived features, further boosts performance. We validate HiGINE on two public datasets, demonstrating improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in veterinary cytology using both optical and holographic microscopy images, addressing the performance gap between these imaging modalities.

Method: Used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification, evaluated across imaging modalities. Applied dataset expansion techniques including automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement specifically for holographic images to address performance gaps.

Result: Achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images. Initial holographic performance was low (2.49% mAP50 detection, 42% classification), but improved to 13.3% mAP50 detection and 54% classification after dataset expansion techniques.

Conclusion: Deep learning can be effectively paired with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices for image classification tasks, though performance gaps exist compared to optical microscopy that can be partially addressed through dataset expansion techniques.

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenMonoGS-SLAM is the first monocular SLAM framework combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with open-set semantic understanding using visual foundation models, achieving strong performance without depth sensors or semantic annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLAM systems with semantic understanding often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. There's a need for monocular SLAM that can understand semantics in diverse, unconstrained settings.

Method: The framework integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with open-set semantic understanding using Visual Foundation Models: MASt3R for visual geometry, and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. It uses self-supervised learning without depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, and includes a memory mechanism for managing high-dimensional semantic features to construct Gaussian semantic feature maps.

Result: The approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.

Conclusion: OpenMonoGS-SLAM successfully demonstrates the feasibility of combining monocular SLAM with open-set semantic understanding using visual foundation models, enabling intelligent perception in open-world environments without specialized sensors or annotations.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a foundational component in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that estimates metric depth from video blur patterns and dense trajectories using joint optical design, leveraging perspective-based blur that varies with object depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera rotational dynamics during handheld shooting cause perspective-based blur that is depth-dependent, creating an opportunity to estimate depth from blur patterns in video streams.

Method: Uses off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information, estimates depth via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densifies sparse trajectories using a vision-language model through joint optical design algorithm.

Result: Strong performance on multiple depth datasets across large depth ranges with good generalization; superior precision compared to real trajectories in handheld settings and accurate dense reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively leverages depth-dependent blur patterns from camera motion to estimate metric depth and reconstruct dense trajectories, demonstrating robust performance in real-world handheld shooting scenarios.

Abstract: In the absence of a mechanical stabilizer, the camera undergoes inevitable rotational dynamics during capturing, which induces perspective-based blur especially under long-exposure scenarios. From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIG framework reframes image generation as sequential semantic process using LLM to decompose prompts into step-by-step instructions, enabling monitoring and mitigating entity collapse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image generation models are opaque "black boxes" that limit human observation, intervention, and control, while their non-human-like workflows make them difficult to interpret.

Method: CoIG uses LLM to decompose complex prompts into sequential simple instructions, then image generation model executes plan by progressively generating/editing images with each step focusing on single semantic entity.

Result: CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to baselines, with novel metrics (CoIG Readability and Causal Relevance) showing improved interpretability.

Conclusion: CoIG framework brings Chain-of-Thought-like advantages to image generation, enabling monitoring, mitigating entity collapse, and making generative processes more interpretable while maintaining performance.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a "black box." This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.

TL;DR: C-DIRA is a lightweight driver behavior recognition framework that combines dynamic ROI routing and domain-invariant adversarial learning to achieve efficient, accurate, and generalizable performance on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lightweight models for driver distraction recognition fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues and have reduced performance on unseen drivers or varying conditions. ROI-based methods increase computational cost, creating a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy that needs to be addressed.

Method: Proposes C-DIRA framework with: 1) Saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction, 2) Dynamic ROI routing that applies ROI inference only to high-difficulty samples, and 3) Pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning for domain-invariant features robust to driver/background variations.

Result: On State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset, C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. Shows robustness under visual degradation (blur, low-light) and stable performance across unseen domains.

Conclusion: C-DIRA effectively achieves compactness, efficiency, and generalization for real-time driver behavior recognition on edge devices, balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization.

TL;DR: MNAME is a plug-and-play training framework for denoising generative models that uses a memory bank mechanism to provide abundant negative samples for contrastive learning without external encoders, achieving faster convergence and state-of-the-art FID scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Denoising generative models (diffusion, flow-matching) have high training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. Existing approaches that inject discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment rely on external pre-trained encoders, introducing overhead and domain shift issues.

Method: Proposes MNAME with a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations, decoupling negative sample count from mini-batch size. Uses a low-dimensional projection head to minimize memory/bandwidth overhead. The method is self-contained, requires no external encoders, and adds no inference-time parameters or computational cost.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art FID of 2.40 on ImageNet-256 within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods. Enables substantially faster convergence and superior generative quality more efficiently.

Conclusion: MNAME provides an effective plug-and-play solution that eliminates dependency on external encoders while improving training efficiency and generative quality through abundant negative samples from a memory bank mechanism.

Abstract: The dominance of denoising generative models (e.g., diffusion, flow-matching) in visual synthesis is tempered by their substantial training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently. On ImageNet-256, {\mname} achieves a state-of-the-art FID of \textbf{2.40} within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods.

Motivation: Current state-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve high accuracy but remain opaque, leaving unanswered which high-level semantic attributes these models actually rely on for their decisions.

Method: Proposes MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework using LoRA-based experts (each linked to a single attribute) and an oracle router for controlled attribution analysis. Uses generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC datasets when attribute annotations are available at test time. Provides quantitative analysis revealing that attributes like clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g., accessories) have limited effect.

Conclusion: Offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice, advancing transparency in person re-identification models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods for OVSS face challenges in precise localization and require complex pipelines, especially for remote sensing with dense small targets. SAM 3's unified segmentation and recognition framework offers potential for simpler, more effective solutions.

Method: 1) Mask fusion strategy combining SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and Transformer decoder outputs for better land coverage. 2) Using presence score from presence head to filter out non-existent categories, reducing false positives from large vocabularies and patch-level processing.

Result: Experiments on extensive remote sensing datasets show promising performance, demonstrating SAM 3's potential for remote sensing OVSS without any training.

Conclusion: Simple adaptation of SAM 3 achieves effective training-free OVSS for remote sensing, offering a simpler alternative to complex CLIP-based pipelines while handling dense small targets better.

Abstract: Most existing methods for training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) are based on CLIP. While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

Motivation: Industrial mushroom cultivation needs computer vision for monitoring and harvesting, but creating large annotated datasets is expensive. Synthetic data offers scalability but often lacks realism for real-world generalization.

Method: Integration of 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, preserving full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations.

Result: Released two synthetic datasets (6,000 images each with over 250k mushroom instances). Mask R-CNN models trained on synthetic data achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K) in zero-shot testing on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully generates photorealistic synthetic data that generalizes well to real-world scenarios without specialized graphics expertise, and can be adapted to other mushroom species or agricultural domains like fruit and leaf detection.

Abstract: Industrial mushroom cultivation increasingly relies on computer vision for monitoring and automated harvesting. However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data. Although the approach is demonstrated on Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, the proposed pipeline can be readily adapted to other mushroom species or to other agricultural domains, such as fruit and leaf detection.

TL;DR: A skewness-guided pruning method for multimodal Swin Transformers achieves 36% model size reduction with no accuracy loss in federated learning for medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance medical vision models are too large for edge devices, and privacy constraints prevent centralized data management, requiring federated learning and model compression solutions.

Method: Proposes skewness-guided pruning that selectively prunes Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers based on statistical skewness of their output distributions, validated in horizontal federated learning environment.

Result: Achieves approximately 36% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy on compact Swin Transformer, maintaining performance while substantially reducing model complexity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices through skewness-guided pruning in federated learning.

Abstract: In recent years, high-performance computer vision models have achieved remarkable success in medical imaging, with some skin lesion classification systems even surpassing dermatology specialists in diagnostic accuracy. However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy. These findings highlight the feasibility of achieving efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices.

TL;DR: Wan-Move is a scalable framework that adds precise motion control to video generation models by making condition features motion-aware through dense point trajectories, achieving commercial-quality motion control without architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion-controllable video generation methods suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, making their outputs insufficient for practical applications. There's a need for precise, high-quality motion control that can scale effectively.

Method: The framework represents object motions with dense point trajectories for fine-grained control, projects these into latent space, propagates first frame features along trajectories to create aligned spatiotemporal feature maps, and integrates these as motion guidance into existing image-to-video models without architecture changes.

Result: Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos with motion controllability rivaling commercial systems like Kling 1.5 Pro's Motion Brush. The framework is scalable, removes need for auxiliary motion encoders, and outperforms existing methods on the MoveBench benchmark and public datasets.

Conclusion: Wan-Move successfully bridges the gap in motion-controllable video generation by providing precise, scalable motion control through motion-aware condition features, achieving commercial-quality results while maintaining compatibility with existing models and enabling comprehensive evaluation through the MoveBench benchmark.

Abstract: We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.

*Yiming Hao,Mutian Xu,Chongjie Ye,Jie Qin,Shunlin Lu,Yipeng Qin,Xiaoguang Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoFA is a hypernetwork framework that predicts personalized LoRA weights in seconds by learning structured distribution patterns in parameter changes, enabling fast model adaptation without task-specific data or lengthy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current personalization methods like LoRA require task-specific data and hours of optimization, making them impractical. Hypernetwork approaches struggle to map fine-grained prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Two-stage hypernetwork: first predicts relative distribution patterns that identify key adaptation regions between LoRA and base model parameters, then uses these patterns to guide final LoRA weight prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments show LoFA consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds across multiple tasks and user prompts, outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

Conclusion: LoFA bridges the gap between efficient personalization and quality adaptation by leveraging structured distribution patterns in parameter changes, enabling practical fast adaptation for visual generative models.

Abstract: Personalizing visual generative models to meet specific user needs has gained increasing attention, yet current methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) remain impractical due to their demand for task-specific data and lengthy optimization. While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

*Jack Brady,Bernhard Schölkopf,Thomas Kipf,Simon Buchholz,Wieland Brendel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative methods with decoder inversion enable compositional generalization, while non-generative encoder methods struggle without large-scale pretraining or added supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether generative approaches (with decoder inversion) are necessary for human-level visual perception by testing compositional generalization capabilities of generative vs. non-generative methods.

Method: Formalize inductive biases required for compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. Theoretically analyze feasibility of enforcing these biases, then empirically test on photorealistic image datasets with various generative and non-generative approaches.

Result: Non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally without necessary inductive biases, requiring large-scale pretraining or added supervision. Generative methods achieve significant improvements in compositional generalization by leveraging suitable inductive biases on decoders with search and replay techniques.

Conclusion: Generative methods with decoder inversion are better suited for achieving compositional generalization, a key aspect of human perception, compared to non-generative encoder methods, supporting the hypothesis that generative approaches are important for human-level visual perception.

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tri-Bench: A benchmark for evaluating VLMs' geometric reasoning under realistic scene changes, focusing on planar triangle problems with camera pose variations and object interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models often fail under realistic scene changes, creating a need for verifiable geometric reasoning to ensure trustworthy and controllable agentic AI.

Method: Created Tri-Bench with planar triangle problems, testing camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference. Evaluated four recent VLMs with fixed prompt containing explicit border guardrail for homography-based solutions.

Result: Overall accuracy ~69% (best ~75%, worst ~64%), with ~72% alignment to 2D projections. All VLMs failed (~0% accuracy) on minority shape classes. Accuracy degraded ~4.1% under camera tilt, showing failure to use explicit frame-of-reference hints.

Conclusion: VLMs struggle with geometric reasoning, default to 2D image cues, fail on minority triangle classes, and don't effectively use explicit reference hints, highlighting limitations for trustworthy agentic AI.

Abstract: Verifiable geometric reasoning is a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI. Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are emerging as powerful generalist tools for remote sensing, capable of integrating information across diverse tasks and enabling flexible, instruction-based interactions via a chat interface. In this work, we enhance VLM-based visual grounding in satellite imagery by proposing a novel structured localization mechanism. Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating structured spatial reasoning into VLMs, paving the way for more reliable real-world satellite data analysis.

TL;DR: A GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework for UAV aerial imagery segmentation that eliminates im2col overhead, reduces memory/computation via structured data sharing among rotated filters, achieving 20-55% faster training and 15-45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotation invariance is crucial for precise object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery where targets have arbitrary orientations. Conventional CNNs lack rotation invariance, degrading segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Existing rotation-invariant methods expand filter banks across orientations but significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic.

Method: Introduces a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional im2col step. Exploits structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters to achieve multi-orientation convolution with reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. Generalizes the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.

Result: Achieves 20-55% faster training and 15-45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN. In eight-orientation setting: up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256×256 inputs; 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024×1024 inputs. Integrated into U-Net yields up to 6% accuracy improvement over non-rotation-aware baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks, demonstrating significant performance gains while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods.

Abstract: Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.
  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for content-aware layout generation either address only subsets of tasks or require separate models for different conditions, lacking a truly unified solution for diverse input-constrained generation sub-tasks.

Method: Proposes UniLayDiff, a Unified Diffusion Transformer that treats layout constraints as a distinct modality using Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture interplay between background image, layout elements, and constraints. Integrates relation constraints through LoRA fine-tuning after pretraining on other tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across unconditional and various conditional generation tasks, being the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

Conclusion: UniLayDiff successfully achieves unified conditional generation while enhancing overall layout quality, providing a single model solution for diverse content-aware layout generation tasks.

Abstract: Content-aware layout generation is a critical task in graphic design automation, focused on creating visually appealing arrangements of elements that seamlessly blend with a given background image. The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-to-3D generators have limitations: they recover reasonable geometry but their object-centric training restricts generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. There's a need for methods that can handle complex scenes with both structural accuracy and high-quality textures.

Method: EvoScene uses a self-evolving, training-free framework with three iterative stages: 1) Spatial Prior Initialization, 2) Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and 3) Spatial-guided Novel View Generation. The approach alternates between 2D and 3D domains, combining geometric reasoning from 3D generation models with visual knowledge from video generation models to progressively improve both structure and appearance.

Result: Experiments on diverse scenes show that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines. The method produces ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications.

Conclusion: EvoScene successfully addresses the challenge of generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from single images by leveraging complementary strengths of existing models through an iterative, training-free framework that progressively refines both geometry and appearance.

Abstract: Generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in vision and graphics. Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance. Experiments on diverse scenes demonstrate that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines, producing ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications.

Motivation: Nighttime environments challenge camera-based perception due to poor lighting. Existing methods passively rely on scene lighting, limiting performance. There's a need for active illumination control to enhance perception without retraining models.

Method: LiDAS combines off-the-shelf perception models with high-definition headlights in a closed-loop system. It dynamically predicts optimal illumination fields to maximize perception performance, reallocating light from empty areas to object regions. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world driving scenarios.

Result: LiDAS achieves +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU improvement over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performance while reducing energy use by 40%. Enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models.

Conclusion: LiDAS transforms headlights into active vision actuators, offering a cost-effective solution for robust nighttime perception. It complements domain-generalization methods and enhances robustness without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception.

Motivation: Reconstructing complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains challenging, requiring efficient methods that can handle multiple reconstruction tasks simultaneously.

Method: Uses unified transformer architecture with novel querying mechanism that avoids dense per-frame decoding and multiple task-specific decoders, allowing flexible probing of 3D positions across space and time.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art, outperforming previous methods across wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks with lightweight, scalable approach enabling efficient training and inference.

Conclusion: D4RT provides simple yet powerful solution for dynamic scene reconstruction, achieving superior performance through unified architecture and efficient querying mechanism.

Abstract: Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.

*Vala Vakilian,Zimeng Wang,Ankit Singh Rawat,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the "short-context dominance hypothesis" - that most sequences only need a small local prefix to predict next tokens. They find 75-80% of sequences require only the last 96 tokens, develop a method to detect challenging long-context sequences, and create a decoding algorithm to mitigate bias from short-context dominance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and address the "short-context dominance hypothesis" - the observation that for most sequences, only a small local context is needed to predict next tokens. This bias in language models may cause them to overlook long-range dependencies, potentially degrading performance on tasks requiring understanding of broader context.

Method: The method involves: 1) Measuring Minimum Context Length (MCL) needed for accurate predictions using LLMs as statistical oracles; 2) Introducing Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL) as a practical proxy that doesn't require knowledge of actual next tokens; 3) Developing a decoding algorithm that uses DaMCL to detect and boost tokens relevant to long-range context.

Result: Results show: 1) 75-80% of sequences from long-context documents require only the last 96 tokens at most; 2) Simple thresholding of DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences; 3) The proposed decoding algorithm improves performance across Q&A tasks and model architectures by mitigating short-context bias.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that short-context dominance is a real phenomenon in LLMs, but it's possible to detect challenging long-context sequences and mitigate the bias. The proposed DaMCL metric and decoding algorithm effectively improve model performance on tasks requiring long-range understanding.

Abstract: We investigate the short-context dominance hypothesis: that for most sequences, a small local prefix suffices to predict their next tokens. Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable pipeline trains specialized retrieval models from unlabeled financial data using iterative student-teacher training, achieving significant improvements in financial document retrieval metrics without human annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose embedding models underperform in specialized domains like finance, while practical deployment faces computation cost, latency, and domain-specific relevance constraints. Existing methods don't effectively bridge the gap between general models and specialized domains without expensive human annotation.

Method: Uses iterative student-teacher training: a general-purpose retrieval embedding model (teacher) guides training of a specialized student model. The pipeline interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining. Each iteration uses the refined student to mine progressively harder examples for subsequent training, distilling domain knowledge into a compact retriever using LLM-judged relevance.

Result: Achieved 27.7% improvement in MRR@5 and 44.6% improvement in mean DCG@5 across 14 financial filing types (21,800 query-document pairs). Improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. The method outperforms prior approaches that directly fine-tune retrieval models with synthetic queries.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a cost-effective solution for bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without human annotation. The iterative student-teacher approach with progressively harder example mining enables effective domain adaptation for retrieval-augmented generation systems.

Abstract: Despite advances in generative large language models (LLMs), practical application of specialized conversational AI agents remains constrained by computation costs, latency requirements, and the need for precise domain-specific relevance measures. While existing embedding models address the first two constraints, they underperform on information retrieval in specialized domains like finance. This paper introduces a scalable pipeline that trains specialized models from an unlabeled corpus using a general purpose retrieval embedding model as foundation. Our method yields an average of 27.7% improvement in MRR$\texttt{@}$5, 44.6% improvement in mean DCG$\texttt{@}$5 across 14 financial filing types measured over 21,800 query-document pairs, and improved NDCG on 3 of 4 document classes in FinanceBench. We adapt retrieval embeddings (bi-encoder) for RAG, not LLM generators, using LLM-judged relevance to distill domain knowledge into a compact retriever. There are prior works which pair synthetically generated queries with real passages to directly fine-tune the retrieval model. Our pipeline differs from these by introducing interaction between student and teacher models that interleaves retrieval-based mining of hard positive/negative examples from the unlabeled corpus with iterative retraining of the student model's weights using these examples. Each retrieval iteration uses the refined student model to mine the corpus for progressively harder training examples for the subsequent training iteration. The methodology provides a cost-effective solution to bridging the gap between general-purpose models and specialized domains without requiring labor-intensive human annotation.

### [109] [Segment, Embed, and Align: A Universal Recipe for Aligning Subtitles to Signing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08094)
*Zifan Jiang,Youngjoon Jang,Liliane Momeni,Gül Varol,Sarah Ebling,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEA (Segment, Embed, and Align) is a universal framework for aligning subtitles to sign language videos across multiple languages, using pretrained models for segmentation and embedding followed by efficient dynamic programming alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches for subtitle alignment in sign language videos are limited by being tied to specific languages or datasets, requiring end-to-end training that lacks generality and flexibility across different sign languages and domains.

Method: SEA uses two pretrained models: one segments video frames into individual signs, and another embeds each sign video clip into a shared latent space with text. A lightweight dynamic programming procedure then aligns the signs with subtitles efficiently on CPUs.

Result: Experiments on four sign language datasets show state-of-the-art alignment performance, with the method running efficiently within a minute even for hour-long episodes, demonstrating cross-language and cross-domain effectiveness.

Conclusion: SEA provides a flexible, universal framework for sign language subtitle alignment that works across multiple languages, can adapt to various scenarios using different resources, and has potential to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing.

Abstract: The goal of this work is to develop a universal approach for aligning subtitles (i.e., spoken language text with corresponding timestamps) to continuous sign language videos. Prior approaches typically rely on end-to-end training tied to a specific language or dataset, which limits their generality. In contrast, our method Segment, Embed, and Align (SEA) provides a single framework that works across multiple languages and domains. SEA leverages two pretrained models: the first to segment a video frame sequence into individual signs and the second to embed the video clip of each sign into a shared latent space with text. Alignment is subsequently performed with a lightweight dynamic programming procedure that runs efficiently on CPUs within a minute, even for hour-long episodes. SEA is flexible and can adapt to a wide range of scenarios, utilizing resources from small lexicons to large continuous corpora. Experiments on four sign language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art alignment performance, highlighting the potential of SEA to generate high-quality parallel data for advancing sign language processing. SEA's code and models are openly available.

### [110] [Universal Adversarial Suffixes Using Calibrated Gumbel-Softmax Relaxation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08123)
*Sampriti Soor,Suklav Ghosh,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Universal adversarial suffixes (4-10 tokens) that reduce accuracy across multiple tasks and models when appended to any input, learned via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation with entropy regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models used as zero/few-shot classifiers are fragile to adversarial prompts, but prior work focuses on task/model-specific triggers that are hard to compare and lack transferability.

Method: Learn universal adversarial suffixes using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to make the optimization differentiable, then discretize for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on label region while masking gold tokens, with entropy regularization to prevent collapse.

Result: Single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence across sentiment analysis, NLI, paraphrase detection, commonsense QA, and physical reasoning tasks on Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B.

Conclusion: Universal adversarial suffixes provide effective and transferable attacks across tasks and model families, demonstrating vulnerabilities in LM-based classifiers and enabling better comparison of adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often used as zero-shot or few-shot classifiers by scoring label words, but they remain fragile to adversarial prompts. Prior work typically optimizes task- or model-specific triggers, making results difficult to compare and limiting transferability. We study universal adversarial suffixes: short token sequences (4-10 tokens) that, when appended to any input, broadly reduce accuracy across tasks and models. Our approach learns the suffix in a differentiable "soft" form using Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and then discretizes it for inference. Training maximizes calibrated cross-entropy on the label region while masking gold tokens to prevent trivial leakage, with entropy regularization to avoid collapse. A single suffix trained on one model transfers effectively to others, consistently lowering both accuracy and calibrated confidence. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, paraphrase detection, commonsense QA, and physical reasoning with Qwen2-1.5B, Phi-1.5, and TinyLlama-1.1B demonstrate consistent attack effectiveness and transfer across tasks and model families.

### [111] [Universal Adversarial Suffixes for Language Models Using Reinforcement Learning with Calibrated Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08131)
*Sampriti Soor,Suklav Ghosh,Arijit Sur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-trained adversarial suffixes outperform gradient/rule-based methods in degrading model accuracy and transferring across tasks/models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial suffix methods (gradient search, rule-based) are brittle and task/model-specific, lacking transferability.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework treats suffix as policy, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization using calibrated cross-entropy rewards to remove label bias and aggregate across surface forms.

Result: RL-trained suffixes consistently degrade accuracy across 5 NLP benchmarks (sentiment, NLI, paraphrase, commonsense) on 3 models (Qwen2-1.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B, Phi-1.5) and transfer better than previous methods.

Conclusion: RL-based adversarial suffix training is more effective and transferable than previous approaches for attacking language models.

Abstract: Language models are vulnerable to short adversarial suffixes that can reliably alter predictions. Previous works usually find such suffixes with gradient search or rule-based methods, but these are brittle and often tied to a single task or model. In this paper, a reinforcement learning framework is used where the suffix is treated as a policy and trained with Proximal Policy Optimization against a frozen model as a reward oracle. Rewards are shaped using calibrated cross-entropy, removing label bias and aggregating across surface forms to improve transferability. The proposed method is evaluated on five diverse NLP benchmark datasets, covering sentiment, natural language inference, paraphrase, and commonsense reasoning, using three distinct language models: Qwen2-1.5B Instruct, TinyLlama-1.1B Chat, and Phi-1.5. Results show that RL-trained suffixes consistently degrade accuracy and transfer more effectively across tasks and models than previous adversarial triggers of similar genres.

*Sjoerd B. Stolwijk,Mark Boukes,Damian Trilling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GLLMs show adequate F1 scores for annotation tasks but differ from human annotations in prevalence, produce different downstream results, and exhibit systematic bias with higher inter-GLLM agreement than human-GLLM agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate bias in GLLM annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations from Boukes (2024), examining how GLLMs perform compared to human annotators across multiple concepts and prompts.

Method: Used various GLLMs (Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, Qwen2.5:72b) with five different prompts to annotate five concepts: political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology, comparing results to manual annotations.

Result: GLLMs performed adequately in F1 scores but differed from manual annotations in prevalence, yielded substantively different downstream results, and displayed systematic bias where GLLMs overlapped more with each other than with manual annotations.

Conclusion: Differences in F1 scores fail to account for the degree of bias in GLLM annotations, highlighting systematic differences between GLLM and human annotations that affect research validity.

Abstract: This paper investigates bias in GLLM annotations by conceptually replicating manual annotations of Boukes (2024). Using various GLLMs (Llama3.1:8b, Llama3.3:70b, GPT4o, Qwen2.5:72b) in combination with five different prompts for five concepts (political content, interactivity, rationality, incivility, and ideology). We find GLLMs perform adequate in terms of F1 scores, but differ from manual annotations in terms of prevalence, yield substantively different downstream results, and display systematic bias in that they overlap more with each other than with manual annotations. Differences in F1 scores fail to account for the degree of bias.

*Janiça Hackenbuchner,Arda Tezcan,Joke Daems*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates gender bias origins in machine translation models using contrastive explanations and saliency attribution to identify which source context tokens trigger specific gender inflections in target translations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While interpretability research exists for understanding black-box models like MT and LLMs, there's limited focus on gender bias despite it being a manifested problem. The research aims to move beyond simply measuring bias to exploring its origins and understanding what contextual factors influence gender decisions in translation.

Method: The study uses gender-ambiguous natural source data and applies contrastive explanations with saliency attribution. It addresses the challenge of lacking scoring thresholds by examining different attribution levels of source words on model gender decisions. The approach compares model-attributed salient words with human perceptions of gender triggers.

Result: The research demonstrates a noticeable overlap between human perceptions of gender triggers and model attribution of salient source words. A linguistic analysis of these salient words provides insights into what contextual elements influence gender decisions in translation models.

Conclusion: The work showcases the importance of understanding model translation decisions regarding gender, how these compare to human decisions, and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias in machine translation systems.

Abstract: Interpretability can be implemented as a means to understand decisions taken by (black box) models, such as machine translation (MT) or large language models (LLMs). Yet, research in this area has been limited in relation to a manifested problem in these models: gender bias. With this research, we aim to move away from simply measuring bias to exploring its origins. Working with gender-ambiguous natural source data, this study examines which context, in the form of input tokens in the source sentence, influences (or triggers) the translation model choice of a certain gender inflection in the target language. To analyse this, we use contrastive explanations and compute saliency attribution. We first address the challenge of a lacking scoring threshold and specifically examine different attribution levels of source words on the model gender decisions in the translation. We compare salient source words with human perceptions of gender and demonstrate a noticeable overlap between human perceptions and model attribution. Additionally, we provide a linguistic analysis of salient words. Our work showcases the relevance of understanding model translation decisions in terms of gender, how this compares to human decisions and that this information should be leveraged to mitigate gender bias.

*Ju-Young Kim,Ji-Hong Park,Se-Yeon Lee,Sujin Park,Gun-Woo Kim*

TL;DR: Proposed soft inductive bias approach with explicit reasoning perspectives to improve inappropriate utterance detection in Korean conversational texts, achieving 87% accuracy with 3.89% improvement over standard supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address growing social concerns about unchecked inappropriate remarks escalating into verbal abuse and criminal behavior in anonymous online environments, with limited research applying Korean LLMs and chain-of-thought reasoning to inappropriate utterance detection.

Method: Soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide inference process, promoting rational decision-making and preventing reasoning errors. Fine-tuned Korean large language model (Kanana-1.5) with this method across different training strategies.

Result: Kanana-1.5 model achieved average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89% over standard supervised learning. Method enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives.

Conclusion: Proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by LLMs and demonstrates effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection through constrained reasoning perspectives that enable more precise and consistent judgments.

Abstract: Recent incidents in certain online games and communities, where anonymity is guaranteed, show that unchecked inappropriate remarks frequently escalate into verbal abuse and even criminal behavior, raising significant social concerns. Consequently, there is a growing need for research on techniques that can detect inappropriate utterances within conversational texts to help build a safer communication environment. Although large-scale language models trained on Korean corpora and chain-of-thought reasoning have recently gained attention, research applying these approaches to inappropriate utterance detection remains limited. In this study, we propose a soft inductive bias approach that explicitly defines reasoning perspectives to guide the inference process, thereby promoting rational decision-making and preventing errors that may arise during reasoning. We fine-tune a Korean large language model using the proposed method and conduct both quantitative performance comparisons and qualitative evaluations across different training strategies. Experimental results show that the Kanana-1.5 model achieves an average accuracy of 87.0046, improving by approximately 3.89 percent over standard supervised learning. These findings indicate that the proposed method goes beyond simple knowledge imitation by large language models and enables more precise and consistent judgments through constrained reasoning perspectives, demonstrating its effectiveness for inappropriate utterance detection.

TL;DR: Hierarchical multi-agent architecture with 64x64 grid of lightweight agents uses spatial curriculum and Thompson Sampling to improve long-horizon reasoning while reducing computation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models and multi-agent systems struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks and escalating computation costs, requiring more efficient distributed reasoning approaches.

Method: Hierarchical multi-agent architecture with 64x64 grid of lightweight agents, selective oracle, spatial curriculum that expands from center outward, NLL confidence measure, and Thompson Sampling curriculum manager for adaptive training zone selection.

Result: Improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation on spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark.

Conclusion: The hierarchical multi-agent architecture with spatial curriculum and adaptive training effectively addresses long-horizon reasoning challenges while reducing computational costs through distributed cooperation.

Abstract: Large Language Models and multi-agent systems have shown promise in decomposing complex tasks, yet they struggle with long-horizon reasoning tasks and escalating computation cost. This work introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that distributes reasoning across a 64*64 grid of lightweight agents, supported by a selective oracle. A spatial curriculum progressively expands the operational region of the grid, ensuring that agents master easier central tasks before tackling harder peripheral ones. To improve reliability, the system integrates Negative Log-Likelihood as a measure of confidence, allowing the curriculum to prioritize regions where agents are both accurate and well calibrated. A Thompson Sampling curriculum manager adaptively chooses training zones based on competence and NLL-driven reward signals. We evaluate the approach on a spatially grounded Tower of Hanoi benchmark, which mirrors the long-horizon structure of many robotic manipulation and planning tasks. Results demonstrate improved stability, reduced oracle usage, and stronger long-range reasoning from distributed agent cooperation.

Abstract: This proposed tutorial focuses on Healthcare Domain Applications of NLP, what we have achieved around HealthcareNLP, and the challenges that lie ahead for the future. Existing reviews in this domain either overlook some important tasks, such as synthetic data generation for addressing privacy concerns, or explainable clinical NLP for improved integration and implementation, or fail to mention important methodologies, including retrieval augmented generation and the neural symbolic integration of LLMs and KGs. In light of this, the goal of this tutorial is to provide an introductory overview of the most important sub-areas of a patient- and resource-oriented HealthcareNLP, with three layers of hierarchy: data/resource layer: annotation guidelines, ethical approvals, governance, synthetic data; NLP-Eval layer: NLP tasks such as NER, RE, sentiment analysis, and linking/coding with categorised methods, leading to explainable HealthAI; patients layer: Patient Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE), health literacy, translation, simplification, and summarisation (also NLP tasks), and shared decision-making support. A hands-on session will be included in the tutorial for the audience to use HealthcareNLP applications. The target audience includes NLP practitioners in the healthcare application domain, NLP researchers who are interested in domain applications, healthcare researchers, and students from NLP fields.

Our extensive evaluation ($>40 $ million survey responses) shows that question structure and response generation methods have a significant impact on the alignment of generated survey responses with human answers, and can be obtained for a fraction of the compute cost. In addition, we offer a no-code user interface that allows researchers to set up robust experiments with LLMs without coding knowledge. We hope that QSTN will support the reproducibility and reliability of LLM-based research in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical communication annotation methods are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Single-task LLM approaches lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability across different clinical frameworks and domains.

Method: Developed MOSAIC using LangGraph-based architecture with four core agents: Plan Agent for codebook selection/workflow planning, Update Agent for maintaining retrieval databases, Annotation Agents using codebook-guided RAG with dynamic few-shot prompting, and Verification Agent for consistency checks and feedback.

Result: Achieved overall F1 score of 0.928 on test set (50 transcripts). Highest performance in Rheumatology subset (F1=0.962), strongest for Patient Behavior categories. Outperformed baseline benchmarks in ablation studies.

Conclusion: MOSAIC demonstrates a scalable, accurate approach to clinical communication annotation that addresses limitations of existing methods through its multi-agent, structured architecture with verification mechanisms.

Abstract: Clinical communication is central to patient outcomes, yet large-scale human annotation of patient-provider conversation remains labor-intensive, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Existing approaches based on large language models typically rely on single-task models that lack adaptability, interpretability, and reliability, especially when applied across various communication frameworks and clinical domains. In this study, we developed a Multi-framework Structured Agentic AI system for Clinical Communication (MOSAIC), built on a LangGraph-based architecture that orchestrates four core agents, including a Plan Agent for codebook selection and workflow planning, an Update Agent for maintaining up-to-date retrieval databases, a set of Annotation Agents that applies codebook-guided retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with dynamic few-shot prompting, and a Verification Agent that provides consistency checks and feedback. To evaluate performance, we compared MOSAIC outputs against gold-standard annotations created by trained human coders. We developed and evaluated MOSAIC using 26 gold standard annotated transcripts for training and 50 transcripts for testing, spanning rheumatology and OB/GYN domains. On the test set, MOSAIC achieved an overall F1 score of 0.928. Performance was highest in the Rheumatology subset (F1 = 0.962) and strongest for Patient Behavior (e.g., patients asking questions, expressing preferences, or showing assertiveness). Ablations revealed that MOSAIC outperforms baseline benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of publicly available Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) datasets for low-resource languages like Basque, particularly at CEFR C1 proficiency level. Need for transparent, reproducible, educationally-grounded NLP research in Basque language education.

Method: Created dataset of 3,200 Basque essays with expert annotations (scores for correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, task alignment plus feedback/error examples). Fine-tuned RoBERTa-EusCrawl (encoder) and Latxa 8B/70B (decoder) models. Proposed novel evaluation combining automatic consistency metrics with expert validation of extracted learner errors.

Result: Encoder models reliable for AES; SFT of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. Fine-tuned Latxa produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies wider range of error types than proprietary models.

Conclusion: Established foundation for transparent, reproducible, educationally-grounded NLP research in low-resource languages like Basque. Dataset and benchmark enable future AES and feedback generation research, demonstrating open-source models can outperform proprietary systems when properly fine-tuned on domain-specific data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first publicly available dataset for Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) and feedback generation in Basque, targeting the CEFR C1 proficiency level. The dataset comprises 3,200 essays from HABE, each annotated by expert evaluators with criterion specific scores covering correctness, richness, coherence, cohesion, and task alignment enriched with detailed feedback and error examples. We fine-tune open-source models, including RoBERTa-EusCrawl and Latxa 8B/70B, for both scoring and explanation generation. Our experiments show that encoder models remain highly reliable for AES, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Latxa significantly enhances performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) closed-source systems such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 in scoring consistency and feedback quality. We also propose a novel evaluation methodology for assessing feedback generation, combining automatic consistency metrics with expert-based validation of extracted learner errors. Results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Latxa model produces criterion-aligned, pedagogically meaningful feedback and identifies a wider range of error types than proprietary models. This resource and benchmark establish a foundation for transparent, reproducible, and educationally grounded NLP research in low-resource languages such as Basque.

*David Samuel,Lilja Øvrelid,Erik Velldal,Andrey Kutuzov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A post-training method for lower-resource languages that preserves fluency when aligning language models with disfluent reward models, using on-policy training without requiring instruction-tuning data in the target language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower-resource languages lack native-speaker datasets and fluent language models for synthetic data generation, making preference optimization challenging. Previous work has focused on English and Chinese, leaving a gap for languages with limited resources.

Method: Proposes an on-policy training method for preference alignment without instruction-tuning data in the target language. Compares with supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning approaches.

Result: Case study on Norwegian Bokmål shows the on-policy approach outperforms alternatives and preserves fluency, as evaluated by native-speaker assessments, without requiring hard-to-obtain data.

Conclusion: On-policy training is crucial for developing fluent preference-aligned language models for lower-resource languages, offering an effective solution without dependency on scarce native-speaker data or instruction-tuning datasets.

Abstract: We propose a post-training method for lower-resource languages that preserves fluency of language models even when aligned by disfluent reward models. Preference-optimization is now a well-researched topic, but previous work has mostly addressed models for English and Chinese. Lower-resource languages lack both datasets written by native speakers and language models capable of generating fluent synthetic data. Thus, in this work, we focus on developing a fluent preference-aligned language model without any instruction-tuning data in the target language. Our approach uses an on-policy training method, which we compare with two common approaches: supervised finetuning on machine-translated data and multilingual finetuning. We conduct a case study on Norwegian Bokmål and evaluate fluency through native-speaker assessments. The results show that the on-policy aspect is crucial and outperforms the alternatives without relying on any hard-to-obtain data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive aggregation method for aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences in federated learning, achieving better fairness while maintaining competitive alignment quality compared to standard aggregation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard methods for aligning large language models often fail to adequately represent diverse human viewpoints in federated learning environments, creating a need for approaches that balance alignment quality with fairness across different populations.

Method: Proposes a federated learning framework where groups locally evaluate model rollouts and produce reward signals, with the server aggregating group-level rewards without accessing raw data. Evaluates standard aggregation techniques (min, max, average) and introduces a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on each group's historical alignment performance.

Result: Experiments on question-answering tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline show that the adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores compared to standard aggregation methods.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and offers a practical solution for developing pluralistic and fairly aligned models in federated learning settings.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of aligning large language models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences within federated learning (FL) environments, where standard methods often fail to adequately represent diverse viewpoints. We introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses the trade-off between alignment quality and fairness when using different aggregation strategies for human preferences. In our federated setting, each group locally evaluates rollouts and produces reward signals, and the server aggregates these group-level rewards without accessing any raw data. Specifically, we evaluate standard reward aggregation techniques (min, max, and average) and introduce a novel adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts preference weights based on a group's historical alignment performance. Our experiments on question-answering (Q/A) tasks using a PPO-based RLHF pipeline demonstrate that our adaptive approach consistently achieves superior fairness while maintaining competitive alignment scores. This work offers a robust methodology for evaluating LLM behavior across diverse populations and provides a practical solution for developing truly pluralistic and fairly aligned models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gradual depth growth in Transformers improves reasoning performance by overcoming the Curse of Depth, leading to better depth utilization and distinct computational circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MIDAS showed that gradually growing Transformer depth reduces training cost and improves reasoning, there's no mechanistic understanding of these gains. The paper aims to connect this to the Curse of Depth phenomenon where later layers contribute less to output in standard models.

Method: The study uses depth-wise analyses to examine how gradual middle stacking growth affects model depth utilization, residual stream structure, and computational block formation. Also proposes a lightweight modification to MIDAS for further improvements.

Result: Gradual growth yields more effective depth utilization, alters residual stream structure, and facilitates formation of permutable computational blocks. The proposed MIDAS modification shows further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Gradual depth growth leads to distinct computational circuits and overcomes limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models, providing mechanistic understanding of performance gains.

Abstract: Gradually growing the depth of Transformers during training can not only reduce training cost but also lead to improved reasoning performance, as shown by MIDAS (Saunshi et al., 2024). Thus far, however, a mechanistic understanding of these gains has been missing. In this work, we establish a connection to recent work showing that layers in the second half of non-grown, pre-layernorm Transformers contribute much less to the final output distribution than those in the first half - also known as the Curse of Depth (Sun et al., 2025, Csordás et al., 2025). Using depth-wise analyses, we demonstrate that growth via gradual middle stacking yields more effective utilization of model depth, alters the residual stream structure, and facilitates the formation of permutable computational blocks. In addition, we propose a lightweight modification of MIDAS that yields further improvements in downstream reasoning benchmarks. Overall, this work highlights how the gradual growth of model depth can lead to the formation of distinct computational circuits and overcome the limited depth utilization seen in standard non-grown models.

*Guangzhi Xiong,Zhenghao He,Bohan Liu,Sanchit Sinha,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGLens is a lightweight hallucination detector for RAG systems that uses sparse autoencoders to analyze LLM internal representations, achieving superior detection performance with interpretable rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG hallucination detection methods either require large-scale annotated data for training or incur high inference costs from external LLM judges, while current internal representation-based approaches have limited accuracy.

Method: Uses sparse autoencoders to disentangle LLM internal activations, identifies hallucination-specific features through information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, creating a lightweight detector called RAGLens.

Result: RAGLens achieves superior hallucination detection performance compared to existing methods, provides interpretable rationales for decisions, enables post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG, and reveals insights into hallucination signal distribution within LLMs.

Conclusion: RAGLens offers an effective, lightweight solution for RAG hallucination detection using mechanistic interpretability approaches, advancing both detection accuracy and interpretability while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens.

### [125] [Learning to Control Physically-simulated 3D Characters via Generating and Mimicking 2D Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08500)
*Jianan Li,Xiao Chen,Tao Huang,Tien-Tsin Wong*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Mimic2DM learns 3D character motion controllers directly from 2D video keypoints without needing 3D motion capture data, enabling physically plausible motion synthesis across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video data is more cost-effective than motion capture but synthesizing realistic 3D behaviors directly from videos is challenging. Existing methods rely on motion reconstruction techniques that struggle with generalizability, require 3D training data, or fail to produce physically plausible poses, especially for challenging scenarios like human-object interaction or non-human characters.

Method: Mimic2DM learns control policies directly from 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. It minimizes reprojection error to train a single-view 2D motion tracking policy that follows arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation. The approach aggregates multiple views to acquire 3D tracking capabilities and integrates a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator into a hierarchical control framework for high-quality reference trajectories.

Result: The approach effectively learns to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across various domains including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Conclusion: Mimic2DM provides a versatile framework for learning 3D motion controllers directly from widely available 2D video data, overcoming limitations of previous methods that required 3D motion data or produced physically implausible results, enabling applications in challenging scenarios and diverse domains.

Abstract: Video data is more cost-effective than motion capture data for learning 3D character motion controllers, yet synthesizing realistic and diverse behaviors directly from videos remains challenging. Previous approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf motion reconstruction techniques to obtain 3D trajectories for physics-based imitation. These reconstruction methods struggle with generalizability, as they either require 3D training data (potentially scarce) or fail to produce physically plausible poses, hindering their application to challenging scenarios like human-object interaction (HOI) or non-human characters. We tackle this challenge by introducing Mimic2DM, a novel motion imitation framework that learns the control policy directly and solely from widely available 2D keypoint trajectories extracted from videos. By minimizing the reprojection error, we train a general single-view 2D motion tracking policy capable of following arbitrary 2D reference motions in physics simulation, using only 2D motion data. The policy, when trained on diverse 2D motions captured from different or slightly different viewpoints, can further acquire 3D motion tracking capabilities by aggregating multiple views. Moreover, we develop a transformer-based autoregressive 2D motion generator and integrate it into a hierarchical control framework, where the generator produces high-quality 2D reference trajectories to guide the tracking policy. We show that the proposed approach is versatile and can effectively learn to synthesize physically plausible and diverse motions across a range of domains, including dancing, soccer dribbling, and animal movements, without any reliance on explicit 3D motion data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOD outperforms OOD in multi-threaded A* search with better cache efficiency and execution time, though single-threaded versions beat multi-threaded ones due to thread management overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory requires hardware-aware software design paradigms to maximize hardware efficiency.

Method: Developed and compared four A* search algorithm versions: single-threaded OOD, single-threaded DOD, multi-threaded OOD, and multi-threaded DOD, measuring execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses.

Result: DOD showed significant performance gains in multi-threaded tests with faster execution and fewer cache misses. Single-threaded versions outperformed multi-threaded ones due to thread management overhead.

Conclusion: DOD's consistent advantages in critical metrics demonstrate its architectural superiority for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex AI and parallel computing tasks.

Abstract: The growing performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory necessitates hardware-aware software design paradigms. This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.

*Arvind Agarwal,Lisa Amini,Sameep Mehta,Horst Samulowitz,Kavitha Srinivas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a paradigm shift from AI-assisted data management to fully autonomous data estates using intelligent agents across the entire data lifecycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI assistants only help specific personas with limited tasks, falling short of full automation. As AI capabilities advance, there's an opportunity to achieve fully autonomous data management systems that can handle inherent complexities previously resistant to automation.

Method: The paper explores how intelligent agents can autonomously manage each stage of the modern data stack, moving from independent component operations to holistic handling of the entire data lifecycle. It examines how agents can streamline data processes to build self-sufficient systems.

Result: The paper presents a vision for autonomous data estates where intelligent agents manage the complete data lifecycle, creating systems usable by both human end-users and AI itself, though specific implementation results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The paper argues for a paradigm shift toward fully autonomous data management using intelligent agents, identifies opportunities for this transition, highlights open research questions, and aims to inspire debate, further research, collaboration, and facilitate more autonomous data systems.

Abstract: Enterprise data management is a monumental task. It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.

### [128] [SkipKV: Selective Skipping of KV Generation and Storage for Efficient Inference with Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07993)
*Jiayi Tian,Seyedarmin Azizi,Yequan Zhao,Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Sean McPherson,Sharath Nittur Sridhar,Zhengyang Wang,Zheng Zhang,Massoud Pedram,Souvik Kundu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SkipKV is a training-free KV cache compression method that uses sentence-level eviction and generation steering to reduce KV cache overhead in large reasoning models while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from significant KV cache overhead that grows linearly with verbose chain-of-thought reasoning, causing memory and throughput bottlenecks. Existing KV cache eviction methods fail in multi-batch settings due to unstable token-wise scoring and padding token issues, and often generate longer sequences.

Method: SkipKV operates at sentence-level rather than token-level: 1) Uses a sentence-scoring metric to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence, 2) Dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update hidden activation states during inference to suppress redundant generation and enforce concise responses.

Result: SkipKV maintains up to 26.7% improved accuracy compared to alternatives at similar compression budgets, generates up to 1.6× fewer tokens than state-of-the-art methods, and improves throughput up to 1.7× across multiple reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: SkipKV effectively addresses KV cache overhead in large reasoning models through sentence-level compression and generation steering, outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency for chain-of-thought reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores empowerment as a bridge between Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning, suggesting it explains human causal learning and could enable machines to learn causal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with causal learning, while humans excel at it. The paper aims to connect Bayesian causal learning with reinforcement learning through the concept of empowerment to better understand human cognition and improve machine learning.

Method: The paper proposes empowerment as a theoretical bridge between Causal Bayes Net formalism and reinforcement learning. It conducts an empirical study testing how children and adults use empowerment cues to infer causal relations and design interventions.

Result: The empirical study systematically examines how children and adults leverage empowerment cues for causal inference and intervention design, demonstrating the practical application of empowerment theory.

Conclusion: Empowerment serves as a crucial link between Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning, potentially explaining human causal learning mechanisms and offering a tractable computational approach for machines to learn causal world models.

Abstract: Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called "empowerment" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. "Empowerment" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.

TL;DR: KPI framework integrates medical knowledge graphs with prototype-aware contrastive learning and LLM-generated explanations to improve disease prediction from patient-side information, addressing imbalanced distributions and interpretability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current disease prediction methods from patient demographics and self-reported symptoms face challenges with imbalanced disease distributions and lack of interpretability, leading to biased or unreliable predictions that limit practical healthcare applications.

Method: KPI framework: 1) Integrates structured medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, 2) Constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, 3) Uses contrastive learning to enhance accuracy for long-tailed diseases, and 4) Employs LLMs to generate patient-specific medical explanations.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that align closely with patient narratives.

Conclusion: KPI offers a practical solution for patient-centered healthcare delivery by improving both predictive accuracy (especially for rare diseases) and interpretability through medically relevant explanations.

Abstract: Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.

TL;DR: Quantitative scaling principles for LM-based agent systems reveal tool-coordination trade-offs, capability saturation effects, and topology-dependent error amplification across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread adoption of LM-based agent systems for real-world AI applications, there's a lack of principled understanding of what determines their performance, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than evidence-based design choices.

Method: Evaluated five canonical agent architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) across four diverse benchmarks using three LLM families, spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. Derived predictive model using empirical coordination metrics including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy.

Result: Identified three dominant effects: 1) tool-coordination trade-off where tool-heavy tasks suffer from multi-agent overhead, 2) capability saturation where coordination yields diminishing returns once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%, 3) topology-dependent error amplification (17.2x for independent vs 4.4x for centralized). Centralized coordination improved parallelizable tasks by 80.9%, decentralized excelled on dynamic web navigation (+9.2%), but all multi-agent variants degraded sequential reasoning by 39-70%. Framework predicts optimal strategy for 87% of held-out configurations.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative scaling principles for agent systems, offering a predictive framework based on measurable task properties that can guide principled design choices rather than relying on heuristics, achieving cross-validated R^2=0.513 for performance prediction.

Abstract: Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, all multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations, providing a predictive principle of agentic scaling based on measurable task properties.

### [137] [rSIM: Incentivizing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Reinforced Strategy Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08300)
*Sijia Chen,Baochun Li,Di Niu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: rSIM is a reinforced strategy injection mechanism that transforms LLMs into Reasoning Language Models by using a small planner trained with MARL to inject reasoning strategies into CoTs, enabling small models to outperform much larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the observation that LLMs develop "aha" moments and advanced reasoning strategies like self-reflection and deep thinking during RL post-training. The authors aim to create a mechanism that can inject such reasoning strategies into any LLM to transform it into a Reasoning Language Model (RLM) without requiring extensive retraining.

Method: The proposed rSIM uses a leader-follower framework with multi-agent RL (MARL). A small planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) to adaptively inject reasoning strategies into the LLM's chain of thoughts. The training uses straightforward rule-based rewards, and the planner learns to guide the LLM's reasoning process through strategy injection.

Result: Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. The planner is generalizable - trained once and applicable as a plug-in to improve reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. It also supports continual learning across tasks, allowing planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to wider problem ranges.

Conclusion: rSIM provides an effective mechanism to transform any LLM into a Reasoning Language Model through adaptive strategy injection. The approach enables small models to achieve reasoning capabilities surpassing much larger models, offers plug-and-play applicability, and supports continual learning for improved generalization across diverse reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.

Result: Random forest regressor performed best with R² scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test), demonstrating strong nonlinear mapping ability for CBR prediction.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ML models, particularly random forest, offer an effective alternative to traditional CBR testing, supporting digital transformation in geotechnical engineering through intelligent, data-driven approaches.

Abstract: The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.

Abstract: Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types.

The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are powerful for graph-structured data but their complexity impedes understanding decision-making. Current XAI methods struggle with intricate graph relationships - post-hoc methods are computationally expensive and unreliable, while interpretable models lack generalizability.

Method: Develops a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning that moves beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions, offering adaptable and computationally efficient explanations.

Result: The proposed framework aims to provide better explanations for GNNs by addressing the shortcomings of current methods, though specific experimental results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: A new XAI framework is needed to provide reliable, efficient explanations for GNNs that capture structural influences on predictions, bridging the gap between post-hoc and interpretable approaches while overcoming their respective limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.

Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents rely heavily on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. The authors aim to create a more robust and efficient approach inspired by human problem-solving.

Method: DuSAR uses a single frozen LLM with two complementary strategies: high-level holistic planning and context-grounded local policy. These interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score, dynamically revising global plans when stuck or refining them upon meaningful advancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B, more than doubling prior best of 13.0%) and 4.02% on Mind2Web (also more than doubling strongest baseline). Reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: DuSAR demonstrates that dual-strategy coordination with reflection enables efficient, demonstration-free reasoning in LLM agents. The framework is flexible and compatible with external knowledge, as optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often rely on external demonstrations or retrieval-augmented planning, leading to brittleness, poor generalization, and high computational overhead. Inspired by human problem-solving, we propose DuSAR (Dual-Strategy Agent with Reflecting) - a demonstration-free framework that enables a single frozen LLM to perform co-adaptive reasoning via two complementary strategies: a high-level holistic plan and a context-grounded local policy. These strategies interact through a lightweight reflection mechanism, where the agent continuously assesses progress via a Strategy Fitness Score and dynamically revises its global plan when stuck or refines it upon meaningful advancement, mimicking human metacognitive behavior. On ALFWorld and Mind2Web, DuSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance with open-source LLMs (7B-70B), reaching 37.1% success on ALFWorld (Llama3.1-70B) - more than doubling the best prior result (13.0%) - and 4.02% on Mind2Web, also more than doubling the strongest baseline. Remarkably, it reduces per-step token consumption by 3-9X while maintaining strong performance. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of dual-strategy coordination. Moreover, optional integration of expert demonstrations further boosts results, highlighting DuSAR's flexibility and compatibility with external knowledge.

Conclusion: DeepFeature demonstrates superior performance in generating context-aware features for wearable biosignals, addressing limitations of existing methods through LLM empowerment and robust feature generation processes.

Abstract: Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains, current approaches focus on technical metrics while neglecting sociotechnical dimensions, creating a critical alignment problem between AI behavior and human values.

Method: IDAIF establishes systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and AI architectural layers (Data-Pipeline-Inference-Agentic-Normative), incorporating multi-objective Pareto optimization, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration, causal DAGs for hallucination mitigation, adversarial debiasing with RLHF, and an Assurance Layer for assumption failures.

Result: Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains, showing practical implementation of the framework.

Conclusion: IDAIF represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Impact-Driven AI Framework (IDAIF), a novel architectural methodology that integrates Theory of Change (ToC) principles with modern artificial intelligence system design. As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains. This framework represents a paradigm shift from model-centric to impact-centric AI development, providing engineers with concrete architectural patterns for building ethical, trustworthy, and socially beneficial AI systems.

### [145] [Using reinforcement learning to probe the role of feedback in skill acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08463)
*Antonio Terpin,Raffaello D'Andrea*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL agent learns to control drag on spinning cylinder in water channel using flow feedback, discovering high-performance policies that work open-loop once learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study skill acquisition under controlled conditions, bypassing human subjects and using physical systems with complex dynamics that are difficult to simulate accurately.

Method: Interfaced RL agent with spinning cylinder in water channel to maximize/minimize drag; used high-dimensional flow feedback during training; compared performance with and without feedback.

Result: Flow feedback enabled discovery of high-performance drag-control strategies in minutes; learned policies worked open-loop without feedback; without feedback during training, agent failed at drag maximization but succeeded (slower) at minimization.

Conclusion: Learning a skill can require richer information than executing it; learning conditions depend on goal, not dynamics/policy complexity; feedback crucial for discovery but not execution.

Abstract: Many high-performance human activities are executed with little or no external feedback: think of a figure skater landing a triple jump, a pitcher throwing a curveball for a strike, or a barista pouring latte art. To study the process of skill acquisition under fully controlled conditions, we bypass human subjects. Instead, we directly interface a generalist reinforcement learning agent with a spinning cylinder in a tabletop circulating water channel to maximize or minimize drag. This setup has several desirable properties. First, it is a physical system, with the rich interactions and complex dynamics that only the physical world has: the flow is highly chaotic and extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model or simulate accurately. Second, the objective -- drag minimization or maximization -- is easy to state and can be captured directly in the reward, yet good strategies are not obvious beforehand. Third, decades-old experimental studies provide recipes for simple, high-performance open-loop policies. Finally, the setup is inexpensive and far easier to reproduce than human studies. In our experiments we find that high-dimensional flow feedback lets the agent discover high-performance drag-control strategies with only minutes of real-world interaction. When we later replay the same action sequences without any feedback, we obtain almost identical performance. This shows that feedback, and in particular flow feedback, is not needed to execute the learned policy. Surprisingly, without flow feedback during training the agent fails to discover any well-performing policy in drag maximization, but still succeeds in drag minimization, albeit more slowly and less reliably. Our studies show that learning a high-performance skill can require richer information than executing it, and learning conditions can be kind or wicked depending solely on the goal, not on dynamics or policy complexity.

TL;DR: A lightweight transfer learning approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL) for state-of-health monitoring of lithium-ion batteries in portable devices, achieving significant accuracy improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transfer learning-based SOH monitoring consumes substantial computational resources, making it infeasible for portable mobile devices where it would reduce working endurance. There's a need for lightweight TL approaches that can leverage knowledge from source conditions while minimizing computational overhead.

Method: Proposes CITL with: 1) semi-supervised TL mechanism using unlabeled target data to minimize monitoring residual by iteratively adding network nodes; 2) comprehensive cross-domain learning through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization; 3) convergence analysis to guarantee TL performance and network compactness.

Result: CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS³LSTM by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34% respectively in SOH estimation using root mean square error, validated on realistic UAV battery dataset from dozens of flight missions.

Conclusion: The proposed lightweight CITL approach effectively addresses computational resource limitations in portable devices while achieving superior SOH monitoring accuracy through constructive incremental learning and comprehensive cross-domain optimization.

Abstract: Accurate and rapid state-of-health (SOH) monitoring plays an important role in indicating energy information for lithium-ion battery-powered portable mobile devices. To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error.

Method: CogMCTS tightly integrates LLM cognitive guidance with MCTS using: 1) multi-round cognitive feedback incorporating historical experience, node information, and negative outcomes; 2) dual-track node expansion with elite heuristic management; 3) strategic mutation of heuristic forms and parameters.

Result: Experimental results show CogMCTS outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in stability, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: CogMCTS effectively addresses limitations of existing LLM-based AHD methods by achieving better exploration-exploitation balance through cognitive-guided MCTS integration, leading to improved heuristic optimization performance.

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an effective1 framework for solving complex optimization prob-2 lems. The development of large language mod-3 els (LLMs) enables the automated generation of4 heuristics. Existing LLM-based evolutionary meth-5 ods rely on population strategies and are prone6 to local optima. Integrating LLMs with Monte7 Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improves the trade-off8 between exploration and exploitation, but multi-9 round cognitive integration remains limited and10 search diversity is constrained. To overcome these11 limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-12 guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS13 tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mecha-14 nism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient au-15 tomated heuristic optimization. The framework16 employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incor-17 porate historical experience, node information, and18 negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuris-19 tic generation. Dual-track node expansion com-20 bined with elite heuristic management balances the21 exploration of diverse heuristics and the exploita-22 tion of high-quality experience. In addition, strate-23 gic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and pa-24 rameters to further enhance the diversity of the so-25 lution and the overall optimization performance.26 The experimental results indicate that CogMCTS27 outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in28 stability, efficiency, and solution quality.

See-Control comprises three key components: (1) an ESO benchmark with 155 tasks and corresponding evaluation metrics; (2) an MLLM-based embodied agent that generates robotic control commands without requiring ADB or system back-end access; and (3) a richly annotated dataset of operation episodes, offering valuable resources for future research. By bridging the gap between digital agents and the physical world, See-Control provides a concrete step toward enabling home robots to perform smartphone-dependent tasks in realistic environments.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical reasoning in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) oncology necessitates the integrated interpretation of endoscopic imagery, radiological data, and biochemical markers. Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy.

*Yiming Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a "human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement" paradigm that transforms dual black boxes (human intuition and AI decision-making) into a functional white-box system through structured meta-interaction and a plug-and-play cognitive framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the fundamental divide between human experts' implicit intuition (cognitive black box) and AI's untrustworthy decision-making (computational black box), creating a more transparent, auditable, and collaborative human-AI system.

Method: Develops a "plug-and-play cognitive framework" - computable knowledge packages extracted from expert dialogues, loaded into Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN) through structured "meta-interaction" protocols.

Result: Enables conversion of expert thinking (medical diagnostics, teaching intuition) into reusable, scalable public assets, shifting from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a thinking partner" while providing engineering proof for "cognitive equity."

Conclusion: Proposes a new AI governance path through "transparency of interaction protocols" rather than model introspection, offering a verifiable, intervenable paradigm for cognitive enhancement and inclusion, with open-sourced framework.

Abstract: Currently, there exists a fundamental divide between the "cognitive black box" (implicit intuition) of human experts and the "computational black box" (untrustworthy decision-making) of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper proposes a new paradigm of "human-AI collaborative cognitive enhancement," aiming to transform the dual black boxes into a composable, auditable, and extensible "functional white-box" system through structured "meta-interaction." The core breakthrough lies in the "plug-and-play cognitive framework"--a computable knowledge package that can be extracted from expert dialogues and loaded into the Recursive Adversarial Meta-Thinking Network (RAMTN). This enables expert thinking, such as medical diagnostic logic and teaching intuition, to be converted into reusable and scalable public assets, realizing a paradigm shift from "AI as a tool" to "AI as a thinking partner." This work not only provides the first engineering proof for "cognitive equity" but also opens up a new path for AI governance: constructing a verifiable and intervenable governance paradigm through "transparency of interaction protocols" rather than prying into the internal mechanisms of models. The framework is open-sourced to promote technology for good and cognitive inclusion. This paper is an independent exploratory research conducted by the author. All content presented, including the theoretical framework (RAMTN), methodology (meta-interaction), system implementation, and case validation, constitutes the author's individual research achievements.

### [154] [Towards Foundation Models with Native Multi-Agent Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08743)
*Shuyue Hu,Haoyang Yan,Yiqun Zhang,Yang Chen,Dongzhan Zhou,Lei Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models need native multi-agent intelligence beyond single-agent capabilities, as empirical evidence shows strong single-agent performance doesn't automatically translate to robust multi-agent abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are becoming the "brain" of AI agents, but current efforts focus on single-agent abilities. The next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence, as strong single-agent performance alone doesn't guarantee effective multi-agent capabilities.

Method: The paper identifies four core capabilities for FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. It provides extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models to demonstrate that single-agent performance doesn't automatically yield multi-agent intelligence.

Result: Empirical evidence across 41 LLMs shows that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically produce robust multi-agent intelligence, challenging assumptions about spontaneous emergence of multi-agent abilities.

Conclusion: The paper outlines key research directions for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence, including dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations to address the identified gap.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the "brain" of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.

TL;DR: Aerial STAR-RIS outperforms RIS at low altitudes due to full-space coverage, while RIS performs better near base stations at higher altitudes in 6G wireless networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIS and STAR-RIS on UAVs offer flexible deployment for 6G networks, but a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has been lacking, particularly in 3D wireless environments.

Method: Established accurate channel models with directional radiation patterns, formulated joint optimization problems for both architectures, and proposed efficient solutions using weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and block coordinate descent algorithms.

Result: STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, while RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical deployment insights for aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems, highlighting the complementary strengths of RIS and STAR-RIS architectures in different operational scenarios.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) have emerged as key enablers for enhancing wireless coverage and capacity in next-generation networks. When mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), they benefit from flexible deployment and improved line-of-sight conditions. Despite their promising potential, a comprehensive performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS architectures has not been thoroughly investigated. This letter presents a detailed performance comparison between aerial RIS and STAR-RIS in three-dimensional wireless environments. Accurate channel models incorporating directional radiation patterns are established, and the influence of deployment altitude and orientation is thoroughly examined. To optimize the system sum-rate, we formulate joint optimization problems for both architectures and propose an efficient solution based on the weighted minimum mean square error and block coordinate descent algorithms. Simulation results reveal that STAR-RIS outperforms RIS in low-altitude scenarios due to its full-space coverage capability, whereas RIS delivers better performance near the base station at higher altitudes. The findings provide practical insights for the deployment of aerial intelligent surfaces in future 6G communication systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As agentic AI adoption accelerates, organizations face challenges in designing reliable, observable, maintainable, and safe production-grade workflows that integrate multiple specialized agents, tools, and orchestration logic.

Method: Introduces a structured engineering lifecycle covering workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol (MCP), tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. Presents nine core best practices including tool-first design, pure-function invocation, single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, and containerized deployment.

Result: Provides a comprehensive case study of a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow demonstrating the principles in practice, offering architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights.

Conclusion: The paper offers a foundational reference for building robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows by combining structured engineering approaches with practical best practices for reliable deployment and operation.

Abstract: Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.

TL;DR: CARLoS is a framework for characterizing LoRAs without metadata by analyzing their generation behavior, creating a three-part representation (Directions, Strength, Consistency) that enables semantic retrieval and copyright analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured LoRA ecosystem lacks reliable discovery methods, as existing approaches depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability.

Method: Analyzed 650+ LoRAs through image generation across various prompts and seeds, using CLIP embeddings and differences from base-model generations to create a three-part representation: Directions (semantic shift), Strength (effect significance), and Consistency (effect stability).

Result: Developed an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations.

Conclusion: CARLoS provides a practical system for LoRA analysis that enables semantic retrieval and also supports copyright analysis by linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative components, such as LoRAs, has created a vast but unstructured ecosystem. Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.

Conclusion: EcomBench addresses the gap in practical agent evaluation by providing a dynamic benchmark grounded in real e-commerce applications, enabling measurement of agents' practical capabilities in modern e-commerce environments.

Abstract: Foundation agents have rapidly advanced in their ability to reason and interact with real environments, making the evaluation of their core capabilities increasingly important. While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces REST and REST+ benchmarks to evaluate cross-modal inconsistency in MLLMs, showing that current models cannot consistently reason across image, text, and mixed modalities despite being trained on both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, but they cannot perform the same tasks consistently across different modalities, revealing a fundamental inconsistency problem.

Method: Created REST and REST+ benchmarks with samples containing same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed). Evaluated 15 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyzed OCR issues, visual characteristics impact, and vision token effects.

Result: Found significant modality inconsistency across all tested MLLMs, with variation in degree of inconsistency. Visual characteristics (text color, resolution) and number of vision tokens affect performance. Consistency score correlates with modality gap between text and images.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs exhibit systematic cross-modal inconsistency that cannot be solved by simple modality conversion. The consistency score provides mechanistic interpretation of modality gaps, highlighting fundamental limitations in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.
