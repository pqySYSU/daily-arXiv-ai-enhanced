*SunYoung Park,Jong-Hyeon Lee,Youngjune Kim,Daegyu Sung,Younghyun Yu,Young-rok Cha,Jeongho Ju*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Agent is a multi-agent platform for video search and interactive conversations that uses a fine-tuned vision-language model with multimodal retrieval to overcome text-based limitations, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional text-based retrieval systems have limitations in multimodal scenarios where both visual and spoken content need to be interpreted for effective video search.

Method: Fine-tunes a vision-language model with video preference data, enhances it with retrieval vectors from image-text retrieval, uses three collaborative agents (routing, search, chat), and employs VLM-based retrieval with re-ranking for multimodal video search.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, showing effectiveness for both academic research and real-world applications.

Conclusion: V-Agent successfully addresses multimodal video search challenges through collaborative multi-agent architecture and advanced VLM-based retrieval, offering a promising framework for interactive video search systems.

Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications.

### [2] [Comparison of deep learning models: CNN and VGG-16 in identifying pornographic content](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16947)
*Reza Chandra,Adang Suhendra,Lintang Yuniar Banowosari,Prihandoko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN model outperforms VGG-16 for rapid pornographic content detection in websites, achieving 94.87% accuracy with 50 epochs and 0.001 learning rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indonesian government blocked 59,741 websites in 2020 (14,266 pornographic), but VPNs allow public access, creating need for rapid pornographic content identification system.

Method: Developed deep learning system using CNN and VGG-16 models, comprehensively comparing both approaches for effectiveness in detecting pornographic image content quickly.

Result: CNN model achieved best performance: 94.87% accuracy with 50 epochs and 0.001 learning rate, outperforming VGG-16 for rapid pornographic content detection.

Conclusion: CNN model is more effective than VGG-16 for quickly and accurately detecting pornographic content in websites, addressing the VPN bypass problem in Indonesia.

Abstract: In 2020, a total of 59,741 websites were blocked by the Indonesian government due to containing negative content, including pornography, with 14,266 websites falling into this category. However, these blocked websites could still be accessed by the public using virtual private networks (VPNs). This prompted the research idea to quickly identify pornographic content. This study aims to develop a system capable of identifying websites suspected of containing pornographic image content, using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) model. The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly. Based on the findings of the comparison between testing the CNN and VGG-16 models, research results showed that the best test results were obtained in the eighth experiment using the CNN model at an epoch value level of 50 and a learning rate of 0.001 of 0.9487 or 94.87%. This can be interpreted that the CNN model is more effective in detecting pornographic content quickly and accurately compared to using the VGG-16 model.

*Qi Xu,Shuai Gong,Xuming Ran,Haihua Luo,Yangfan Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVM is a modular neural network framework that separates stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, improving generalization across stimuli and individuals in neural response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for neural response simulation fail to clearly separate stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, limiting their ability to generalize across different stimuli and individuals.

Method: AVM uses a structure-preserving framework with a frozen Vision Transformer-based encoder for consistent visual features, plus independently trained modulation paths that account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity.

Result: AVM outperforms state-of-the-art V1T model by ~2% in predictive correlation across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, with 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under cross-dataset adaptation, showing robust generalization and interpretable condition-wise modulation.

Conclusion: AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints that may inform future cortical modeling approaches in neuroscience and biologically inspired AI.

Abstract: While deep learning models have shown strong performance in simulating neural responses, they often fail to clearly separate stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, which limits their ability to generalize across stimuli and individuals. We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.

*Yohanes Yudhi Adikusuma,Qixing Huang,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteGE is a lightweight method for computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces using compact PCA-based descriptors from UDF samples, achieving 300× memory/time reduction and 1000× speedup for shape matching while working with sparse point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based methods for geodesic distance computation rely on large 3D backbones, causing high memory usage and latency that limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings.

Method: Constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDF) samples at informative voxels, eliminating the need for high-capacity networks while remaining robust on sparse point clouds (down to 300 points).

Result: Reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300× compared to existing neural approaches, achieves up to 1000× speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including point-cloud inputs.

Conclusion: LiteGE provides an efficient, lightweight solution for geodesic distance computation that enables fast and accurate shape matching while being suitable for interactive and resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.

### [5] [Enhancing Tree Species Classification: Insights from YOLOv8 and Explainable AI Applied to TLS Point Cloud Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16950)
*Adrian Straker,Paul Magdon,Marco Zullich,Maximilian Freudenberg,Christoph Kleinn,Johannes Breidenbach,Stefano Puliti,Nils Nölke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method links Finer-CAM explanations to TLS projection segments to identify structural features driving tree species discrimination, achieving 96% accuracy with YOLOv8 models on 7 European species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While new sensors and deep learning achieve high accuracy in tree species classification, their decision processes remain unclear. Existing methods like Finer-CAM can highlight features but are uncommon in similar-looking contrastive species, creating a need to understand which structural features drive species discrimination.

Method: Proposed novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features. Used TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European species, trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, and analyzed 630 saliency maps to evaluate feature contributions.

Result: Achieved mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis showed models primarily rely on crown features for classification, with stem features contributing more for European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Finer branches were particularly important. Models considered species similar in ways consistent with human expert judgment.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for improved understanding of decision processes in tree species classification models to reveal dataset/model limitations, biases, and build confidence in predictions. The proposed method successfully identifies structural features driving species discrimination.

Abstract: Classifying tree species has been a core research area in forest remote sensing for decades. New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.

### [6] [Lights, Camera, Consistency: A Multistage Pipeline for Character-Stable AI Video Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16954)
*Chayan Jain,Rishant Sharma,Archit Garg,Ishan Bhanuka,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-stage pipeline for generating cohesive video stories with consistent characters using LLM-generated scripts, text-to-image character visuals, and scene-by-scene video synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video AI struggles with generating long, cohesive video stories while maintaining consistent character identities throughout the narrative.

Method: A filmmaker-like approach: 1) LLM generates detailed production script, 2) Text-to-image model creates consistent character visuals, 3) Video generation model synthesizes each scene individually using visual anchors.

Result: Visual anchoring is essential - removing it causes catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (7.99 to 0.55). Analysis reveals cultural disparities in model performance between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

Conclusion: Multi-stage decomposition with visual priors is crucial for character consistency in long video generation, and cultural biases in current models need addressing.

Abstract: Generating long, cohesive video stories with consistent characters is a significant challenge for current text-to-video AI. We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

*Haotian Ye,Qiyuan He,Jiaqi Han,Puheng Li,Jiaojiao Fan,Zekun Hao,Fitsum Reda,Yogesh Balaji,Huayu Chen,Sheng Liu,Angela Yao,James Zou,Stefano Ermon,Haoxiang Wang,Ming-Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoTok is an adaptive video tokenization framework that uses information theory to allocate tokens based on content richness, achieving 20% token savings without performance loss and 2.3x compression rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video tokenizers compress all content at fixed rates despite variable information density, causing redundancy or information loss. There's a need for adaptive tokenization that matches compression to content richness.

Method: InfoTok uses Shannon's information theory to prove existing methods are suboptimal, develops an ELBO-based algorithm for theoretical optimality, and implements a transformer-based adaptive compressor for adaptive tokenization.

Result: State-of-the-art compression performance: 20% token savings without performance influence, 2.3x compression rates while outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches.

Conclusion: InfoTok enables more compressed yet accurate video tokenization by allocating tokens according to informational richness, offering valuable insights for future video representation research.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.

*Hao Li,Daiwei Lu,Xing Yao,Nicholas Kavoussi,Ipek Oguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-SemiS is a semi-supervised segmentation framework for endoscopic videos that uses cross-supervision, uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels, joint pseudolabel supervision, and mutual learning to achieve superior performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of obtaining reliable segmentation of endoscopic video frames with limited annotation, which is common in clinical settings due to the time-consuming and expensive nature of manual labeling.

Method: Uses four key strategies: (1) Cross-supervision between two networks, (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision aggregating reliable pixels from both networks, and (4) Mutual learning at feature and image levels. Also includes a separate corrective network using spatiotemporal information.

Result: Substantially superior results compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods on two clinical applications: kidney stone laser lithotomy from ureteroscopy and polyp screening from colonoscopy, with limited labeled data.

Conclusion: Endo-SemiS effectively leverages unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning strategies to achieve reliable endoscopic video segmentation with limited annotations, demonstrating strong performance on clinical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Endo-SemiS, a semi-supervised segmentation framework for providing reliable segmentation of endoscopic video frames with limited annotation. EndoSemiS uses 4 strategies to improve performance by effectively utilizing all available data, particularly unlabeled data: (1) Cross-supervision between two individual networks that supervise each other; (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which are generated by selecting high-confidence regions to improve their quality; (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision, which aggregates reliable pixels from the pseudo-labels of both networks to provide accurate supervision for unlabeled data; and (4) Mutual learning, where both networks learn from each other at the feature and image levels, reducing variance and guiding them toward a consistent solution. Additionally, a separate corrective network that utilizes spatiotemporal information from endoscopy video to improve segmentation performance. Endo-SemiS is evaluated on two clinical applications: kidney stone laser lithotomy from ureteroscopy and polyp screening from colonoscopy. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, Endo-SemiS substantially achieves superior results on both datasets with limited labeled data.

TL;DR: LongShOTBench is a diagnostic benchmark for long-form multimodal video understanding with open-ended questions, dialogues, and multimodal reasoning tasks, featuring reference answers and graded rubrics for interpretable evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack both temporal length and multimodal richness, relying on single-score accuracy that obscures failure modes, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation of long-form video understanding.

Method: Created LongShOTBench with open-ended intent-driven questions, single- and multi-turn dialogues, multimodal reasoning tasks, and agentic tool use across video, audio, and speech, using a scalable human-validated pipeline.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show large performance gaps: Gemini-2.5-Flash achieves 52.95%, open-source models below 30%, and their LongShOTAgent attains 44.66%, demonstrating the difficulty of real-world long-form video understanding.

Conclusion: LongShOTBench provides a practical, reproducible foundation for evaluating and improving MLLMs on long-form multimodal video understanding, with all resources publicly available.

Abstract: Long-form multimodal video understanding requires integrating vision, speech, and ambient audio with coherent long-range reasoning. Existing benchmarks emphasize either temporal length or multimodal richness, but rarely both and while some incorporate open-ended questions and advanced metrics, they mostly rely on single-score accuracy, obscuring failure modes. We introduce LongShOTBench, a diagnostic benchmark with open-ended, intent-driven questions; single- and multi-turn dialogues; and tasks requiring multimodal reasoning and agentic tool use across video, audio, and speech. Each item includes a reference answer and graded rubric for interpretable, and traceable evaluation. LongShOTBench is produced via a scalable, human-validated pipeline to ensure coverage and reproducibility. All samples in our LongShOTBench are human-verified and corrected. Furthermore, we present LongShOTAgent, an agentic system that analyzes long videos via preprocessing, search, and iterative refinement. On LongShOTBench, state-of-the-art MLLMs show large gaps: Gemini-2.5-Flash achieves 52.95%, open-source models remain below 30%, and LongShOTAgent attains 44.66%. These results underscore the difficulty of real-world long-form video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-RGPT: A multimodal LLM with enhanced 4D perception for video understanding, trained via perceptual distillation and evaluated on a new region-level 4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs have limited ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics due to weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Current 3D/4D VQA benchmarks focus on static scenes and lack region-level prompting capabilities.

Method: Introduces 4D-RGPT (specialized MLLM for 4D video representation), Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D) training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model, and R4D-Bench benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting via hybrid automated/human-verified pipeline.

Result: 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark, demonstrating enhanced 4D perception and temporal understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed 4D-RGPT with P4D training effectively addresses limitations in current MLLMs' 4D perception, and the R4D-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for depth-aware dynamic scene understanding with region-level capabilities.

Abstract: Despite advances in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics remains limited, constrained by weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Existing 3D and 4D Video Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks also emphasize static scenes and lack region-level prompting. We tackle these issues by introducing: (a) 4D-RGPT, a specialized MLLM designed to capture 4D representations from video inputs with enhanced temporal perception; (b) Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D), a training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model into 4D-RGPT for comprehensive 4D perception; and (c) R4D-Bench, a benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, built via a hybrid automated and human-verified pipeline. Our 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark.

*Martin Schwartz,Fajwel Fogel,Nikola Besic,Damien Robert,Louis Geist,Jean-Pierre Renaud,Jean-Matthieu Monnet,Clemens Mosig,Cédric Vega,Alexandre d'Aspremont,Loic Landrieu,Philippe Ciais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FORMSpoT provides decade-long, nationwide forest canopy height mapping at 1.5m resolution with annual disturbance detection, outperforming existing products for small-scale forest changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The decline of European forest carbon sink requires spatially explicit, frequently updated monitoring tools that can detect changes at individual tree scale, which existing coarse satellite products cannot achieve.

Method: Used SPOT-6/7 annual composites with hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on ALS data, plus dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising for robust change detection.

Result: FORMSpoT-Δ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products, achieving F1-score of 0.44 in mountainous forests (order of magnitude higher than benchmarks), validated against ALS revisits and 5,087 NFI plots.

Conclusion: FORMSpoT enables tree-level forest monitoring at national scale for analyzing management practices, detecting early decline signals, and quantifying carbon losses from subtle disturbances, highlighting importance of sustaining high-resolution satellite missions.

Abstract: The recent decline of the European forest carbon sink highlights the need for spatially explicit and frequently updated forest monitoring tools. Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.

### [12] [Infinite-Homography as Robust Conditioning for Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17040)
*Min-Jung Kim,Jeongho Kim,Hoiyeong Jin,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfCam is a depth-free framework for camera-controlled video-to-video generation that achieves high camera-pose fidelity through infinite homography warping and data augmentation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camera-controlled video generation methods struggle with pose fidelity due to depth estimation errors and limited trajectory diversity in training data, creating a need for more robust solutions.

Method: InfCam uses infinite homography warping to encode 3D camera rotations in 2D latent space and predicts residual parallax terms, combined with a data augmentation pipeline to create diverse trajectory data.

Result: InfCam outperforms baseline methods in both camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating good generalization from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: InfCam provides an effective depth-free solution for camera-controlled video generation with high pose fidelity, addressing key limitations of existing approaches through novel warping techniques and data augmentation.

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

### [13] [Interpretable Similarity of Synthetic Image Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17080)
*Panagiota Gatoula,George Dimas,Dimitris K. Iakovidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IUS (Interpretable Utility Similarity), a novel interpretable measure to assess how similar synthetic medical images are to real images for developing deep learning clinical decision support systems, showing up to 54.6% classification improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing synthetic medical image quality (user studies, inception scores, classification performance) lack interpretability and don't explain why one synthetic dataset might be more useful than another for clinical decision support systems.

Method: Proposes IUS (Interpretable Utility Similarity) measure inspired by generalized neural additive models. Unlike inception-based measures, IUS is interpretable and explains synthetic dataset utility based on clinically relevant image features for CDS systems.

Result: Experimental results on endoscopic, dermoscopic, fundus, X-ray, and ultrasound datasets show that selecting synthetic images with high IUS scores can improve classification performance by up to 54.6%. IUS demonstrates generality across both color and greyscale medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: IUS provides an interpretable, quantitative measure for assessing synthetic medical image similarity to real images for DL-based clinical decision support systems, offering explainable utility assessment that can guide synthetic data selection and improve model performance.

Abstract: Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: "How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGH is a data-driven framework that learns hair dynamics and appearance using 3D Gaussians, enabling realistic animatable hair without physics simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for photorealistic dynamic hair rely on static capture and physics-based models that don't scale well, require manual parameter tuning, and are computationally expensive.

Method: Proposes: (1) coarse-to-fine model for temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across hairstyles; (2) strand-guided optimization module for dynamic 3D Gaussian representation with differentiable rendering for view-consistent appearance learning.

Result: Achieves promising geometry and appearance results, provides scalable data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation, and integrates seamlessly into 3D Gaussian avatar frameworks.

Conclusion: DGH offers an efficient, fully data-driven approach that generalizes across hairstyles and motions, enabling realistic animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation.

Abstract: The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.

TL;DR: A method to transform casual photos into professional portraits by mapping to UV space and using multi-image fine-tuning, preserving identity while improving pose, lighting, and clothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Professional photos have superior lighting, poses, and quality compared to casual self-photos. There's a need to transform ordinary photos into professional versions while preserving the person's unique identity, but no large paired dataset exists for training.

Method: 1) Transform input photos to canonical UV space for occlusion modeling and novel view synthesis, leveraging existing unpaired datasets. 2) Use multi-image fine-tuning to personalize outputs while preserving identity features.

Result: The approach yields high-quality reposed portraits with strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery, successfully transforming casual photos into professional versions.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively creates professional portrait versions from casual photos by operating in UV space and using personalization techniques, addressing the challenge of identity preservation without requiring paired training data.

Abstract: Photographs of people taken by professional photographers typically present the person in beautiful lighting, with an interesting pose, and flattering quality. This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for document background generation with multi-page editing that preserves text readability through latent masking and automated readability optimization while maintaining thematic continuity across pages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a document-centric background generation system that can edit multiple pages while maintaining thematic continuity and ensuring text regions remain readable, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

Method: Uses latent masking to softly attenuate updates in diffusion space for text preservation, introduces Automated Readability Optimization (ARO) to automatically place semi-transparent backing shapes behind text based on WCAG 2.2 standards, and employs a summarization-and-instruction process for multi-page consistency where each page is distilled into compact representations that guide subsequent generations.

Result: Produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents through a training-free framework that allows targeted background editing without compromising readability, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization via user prompts.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges generative modeling with natural design workflows by treating documents as structured compositions with separate layers, enabling multi-page background editing with thematic continuity while automatically ensuring text readability through physics-inspired techniques and perceptual standards.

Abstract: We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

TL;DR: PhysFire-WM is a physics-informed world model that integrates combustion dynamics from physical simulators with cross-task collaborative training to improve fine-grained fire spread prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fire prediction methods are limited to binary mask modeling with sparse signals, failing to capture complex fire dynamics. While world models show promise for video generation, their physical inconsistencies make them unsuitable for accurate fire forecasting.

Method: PhysFire-WM encodes structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, combined with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation through parameter sharing and gradient coordination.

Result: Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate superior accuracy in fire spread prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

Abstract: Fine-grained fire prediction plays a crucial role in emergency response. Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

### [19] [Can Synthetic Images Serve as Effective and Efficient Class Prototypes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17160)
*Dianxing Shi,Dingjie Fu,Yuqiao Liu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGCLIP is a lightweight zero-shot image classification framework that uses LLM-generated prompts to create synthetic reference images via diffusion models, eliminating the need for annotated image-text pairs and dual-tower encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs like CLIP require expensive annotated image-text pairs for modality alignment and use dual-tower encoders that hinder lightweight deployment. The paper aims to reduce dependency on manual annotations and simplify model architecture.

Method: LGCLIP uses an LLM to generate class-specific prompts, which guide a diffusion model to synthesize reference images. These generated images serve as visual prototypes. Real image features are compared with prototype features using only a visual encoder for classification.

Result: Experimental results validate LGCLIP's feasibility and efficiency, showing strong performance in zero-shot classification tasks while requiring only class labels as input.

Conclusion: LGCLIP establishes a novel paradigm for classification by eliminating manual annotations and dual encoders, offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional VLMs for zero-shot image classification.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.

*Qi Zhang,Yuxu Chen,Lei Deng,Lili Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABE-CLIP is a training-free method that enhances attribute-object binding in CLIP models through semantic refinement and local token-patch alignment, improving compositional image-text matching without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly associating objects with attributes, due to its global representation overlooking fine-grained semantics. Existing methods require additional training or extensive negative sampling but show limited generalization and fail to address the fundamental drawbacks of global representations.

Method: ABE-CLIP uses a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for object and attribute phrases, mitigating attribute confusion. It introduces Local Token-Patch Alignment that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches, then aggregates localized similarity scores for final image-text similarity.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Conclusion: ABE-CLIP effectively addresses CLIP's compositional matching limitations through training-free semantic refinement and local alignment, demonstrating strong performance on attribute-object binding tasks without additional model training.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates discrepancies between objective measurements and subjective perceptions of urban greenery across five countries, finding that location/cultural factors influence perception more than demographics or personality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between objective measurements of urban greenery (like Green View Index) and how people subjectively perceive greenery. Understanding these discrepancies is important for urban planning and development, as what people see and feel about greenery may not match actual vegetation measurements.

Method: Used street view imagery to extract contextual information and conducted a comprehensive urban visual perception survey with 1,000 people across five countries, collecting extensive demographic and personality data. Analyzed discrepancies between objective measures (GVI) and subjective scores (pairwise ratings) using human, geographic, and spatial dimensions.

Result: Discrepancies between objective and subjective greenery assessments are comparable worldwide. Demographics and personality don't significantly affect perception. Location (where people live) plays the most significant role in explaining perceptual differences, suggesting cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe urban greenery.

Conclusion: Cultural and location-based factors are more important than individual demographics in explaining differences between measured and perceived urban greenery, highlighting the need to consider subjective perceptions alongside objective measurements in urban planning.

Abstract: Quantifying and assessing urban greenery is consequential for planning and development, reflecting the everlasting importance of green spaces for multiple climate and well-being dimensions of cities. Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy of relative pose estimation for mobile devices with multi-camera systems and IMUs (like self-driving cars) using visual and inertial information.

Method: 1) Decouple rotation matrix and translation vector, establish cost function for relative rotation angle minimizing algebraic error from affine correspondences. 2) Convert global optimization to two polynomials with two unknowns using characteristic equation and its zero first derivative. 3) Solve relative rotation angle with polynomial eigenvalue solver, obtain translation from eigenvector. 4) Propose linear solution for small relative rotations.

Result: The proposed solver outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy on both synthetic data and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The globally optimal solver using affine correspondences effectively improves relative pose estimation accuracy for multi-camera systems with known vertical direction, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

*Xiao Liang,Chenxi Liu,Zhi Ma,Di Wang,Bin Jing,Quan Wang,Yuanyuan Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARCD is a plug-and-play method that uses anatomical masks to guide contrastive decoding at multiple levels, reducing hallucinations in medical vision-language models without requiring expensive training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs suffer from hallucinations where they rely on textual priors rather than visual evidence. Existing solutions have limitations: training-based methods need costly expert annotations, while training-free methods like contrastive decoding apply global, untargeted corrections that are unreliable in complex clinical settings.

Method: Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD) uses anatomical masks to provide targeted, region-specific guidance through a three-tiered contrastive decoding process that dynamically re-weights at token, attention, and logits levels to steer model focus onto specified anatomical regions.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets (chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, ocular ultrasound) show ARCD improves regional understanding, reduces hallucinations, and enhances overall diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: ARCD effectively mitigates hallucinations in MedVLMs through targeted anatomical guidance without requiring expensive training data, making it a scalable and reliable solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) show immense promise in clinical applicability. However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

TL;DR: Fose: A lightweight pansharpening network that fuses one-step diffusion model distillation with E2E models, achieving 7.42× speedup while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models for pansharpening are computationally expensive (multi-step), while E2E models lack priors and have simple structures. Need to combine strengths of both approaches.

Method: Four-stage training strategy: 1) One-step distillation from enhanced SOTA diffusion model (50→1 step), 2) Fusion with E2E model using lightweight ensemble blocks, 3) Comprehensive experiments on three benchmarks.

Result: Significant improvement on three benchmarks, 7.42× speedup ratio compared to baseline diffusion model while achieving better performance.

Conclusion: Fose successfully combines diffusion model accuracy with E2E efficiency through distillation and fusion, creating a lightweight high-performance pansharpening solution.

Abstract: Pansharpening is a significant image fusion task that fuses low-resolution multispectral images (LRMSI) and high-resolution panchromatic images (PAN) to obtain high-resolution multispectral images (HRMSI). The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks. Moreover, we achieve a 7.42 speedup ratio compared to the baseline DM while achieving much better performance. The code and model are released at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Fose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reasoning Palette introduces a latent-modulation framework using VAE to inject stochastic latent variables as token prefixes, enabling strategic contextualization and diverse reasoning paths for vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic sampling in large vision-language models often produces redundant reasoning paths with limited high-level diversity, which constrains both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning training effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a VAE-based framework that infers latent variables from question-answer embeddings, decodes them into learnable token prefixes, and prepends these to input prompts to modulate the model's internal reasoning trajectory before token generation.

Result: The method enables interpretable and controllable strategic behavior, achieves consistent performance gains over standard RL methods across multiple reasoning benchmarks, and enhances exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability.

Conclusion: Reasoning Palette successfully addresses the diversity limitation in stochastic sampling by enabling strategic contextualization through latent modulation, providing a framework for more efficient exploration and improved reasoning performance in vision-language models.

Abstract: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

TL;DR: CheXPO-v2 is a novel alignment framework that addresses hallucinations in medical VLMs by shifting from outcome to process supervision, using a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward with Entity-Relation Matching to penalize incoherent reasoning at the atomic level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Vision-Language Models are prone to hallucinations that compromise clinical reliability. Existing reinforcement learning methods like GRPO rely on sparse outcome-based rewards, which encourage models to "overthink" and generate verbose, unverifiable reasoning that obscures factual errors and poses safety risks.

Method: Proposes CheXPO-v2 with a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism using Entity-Relation Matching. The approach parses reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, providing fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrates this with a hard-example mining strategy.

Result: Significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Conclusion: CheXPO-v2 provides an effective solution to hallucination in medical VLMs by shifting from outcome to process supervision, enabling more reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning with high data efficiency.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations, compromising clinical reliability. While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to "overthink" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs have a fundamental weakness: their vision encoders lack robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agent tasks, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled images, 2) Supervised autoregressive pretraining with limited high-quality data. Two key strategies: model-merging scheme combining encoders trained with different text decoders, and ensemble training fusing features from generalist encoders (SigLIP2) with document/web-specific representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate DAVE's effectiveness as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.

Conclusion: DAVE successfully bridges the gap in VLMs by providing a purpose-built vision encoder with robust structural and spatial information for document understanding and web agent tasks, establishing it as an effective solution for these applications.

Abstract: While Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks, their choice of vision encoders presents a fundamental weakness: their low-level features lack the robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.

*Xuyang Li,Chenyu Li,Danfeng Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AOM is a universal Remote Sensing Foundation Model that handles arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales through spectrum-independent tokenization and multi-scale adaptive patch embedding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models are limited by fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real-world scenarios involving missing bands, cross-sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, which restricts their generalization and practical deployment.

Method: AOM introduces: 1) spectrum-independent tokenizer with dedicated band embeddings for each channel, 2) multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism for varying resolutions, 3) multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism, and 4) channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets (Sentinel-2, Landsat, HLS) show AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under challenging conditions including band missing, cross-sensor, and cross-resolution settings.

Conclusion: AOM successfully addresses the limitations of existing RSFMs by providing a universal model that accommodates arbitrary optical sensor configurations, significantly improving generalization and practical deployment capabilities for remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Optical satellites, with their diverse band layouts and ground sampling distances, supply indispensable evidence for tasks ranging from ecosystem surveillance to emergency response. However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Learning-based visual localization method that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometric structure and visual similarity, improving robustness against noisy geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual localization methods use global descriptors derived from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), which limits discriminative power and reduces robustness when geometric constraints are noisy.

Method: Proposes an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity. Uses batch-mining strategy based on overlap scores and modified contrastive loss, enabling training without manual place labels.

Result: Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: The method effectively corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores and generalizes across diverse environments without requiring manual place labels.

Abstract: Recent learning-based visual localization methods use global descriptors to disambiguate visually similar places, but existing approaches often derive these descriptors from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), limiting their discriminative power and reducing robustness in the presence of noisy geometric constraints. We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

### [31] [Learning When to Look: A Disentangled Curriculum for Strategic Perception in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17227)
*Siqi Yang,Zilve Gao,Haibo Qiu,Fanfan Liu,Peng Shi,Zhixiong Zeng,Qingmin Liao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses "visual forgetting" in multimodal LLMs where models lose visual grounding during extended reasoning. It proposes a curriculum-based framework to disentangle abstract reasoning from strategic visual perception, using SFT for reasoning and RL for learning when to look.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs suffer from "visual forgetting" - they progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning chains extend. This stems from training paradigms that prematurely entangle two distinct cognitive skills: abstract logical reasoning and strategic visual perception, creating both a cold-start deficiency in reasoning and a strategic perception deficit.

Method: 1) Disentangled SFT curriculum: Build robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data first, then anchor to vision using Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT). 2) Reinforcement learning for strategic perception: Formulate timing as RL problem with Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches models when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty.

Result: The framework transforms models from heuristic-driven observers to strategic, grounded reasoners by addressing both the cold-start reasoning deficiency and strategic perception deficit, enabling models to maintain visual grounding during extended reasoning chains.

Conclusion: The paper formalizes two key deficiencies in MLLMs and develops a principled two-stage framework to address visual forgetting, enabling models to learn both "how-to-think" and "when-to-look" effectively for complex visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential but remain brittle in complex, long-chain visual reasoning tasks. A critical failure mode is "visual forgetting", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as "think longer, see less". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning "how-to-think") and (2) strategic visual perception ("when-to-look"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., "wait", "verify"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \textbf{Code}: \url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.

### [32] [Video Detective: Seek Critical Clues Recurrently to Answer Question from Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17229)
*Henghui Du,Chang Zhou,Chunjie Zhang,Xi Chen,Di Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoDetective: An efficient question-aware memory mechanism for MLLMs to process long videos by iteratively seeking critical clues through memory token compression and recurrent aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Video QA challenges MLLMs due to immense context, overloaded information, and prohibitive memory consumption. Existing methods that reduce visual tokens or extend context length may miss useful information or require excessive computation. Only small amounts of crucial information are needed to answer questions.

Method: VideoDetective processes videos iteratively through sub-segments using question-aware compression with special memory tokens. It recurrently aggregates and stores these memory tokens to update history context for reuse in subsequent segments, enabling efficient critical clue seeking while reducing visual tokens.

Result: The method enables MLLMs with 32K context length to process 100K tokens (3600 frames, hour-long videos at 1fps) using only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory. Evaluation across multiple long video benchmarks shows effective critical clue seeking from massive information.

Conclusion: VideoDetective provides an efficient question-aware memory mechanism for LVQA that can handle long videos with limited context length by focusing on critical information through iterative compression and recurrent memory aggregation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Long Video Question-Answering (LVQA) presents a significant challenge for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to immense context and overloaded information, which could also lead to prohibitive memory consumption. While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.

Motivation: Current remote sensing benchmarks have limitations: most use low-resolution imagery, some have flawed reasoning-task designs, and text-only LLMs can perform competitively without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between benchmarks and intended evaluation of visual understanding.

Method: Created RSHR-Bench with 5,329 super-high-resolution images (long side ≥4,000 pixels) from RS corpora and UAV collections. Designed four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. Applied adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification to reduce language priors.

Result: Constructed 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written/verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs covering nine perception categories and four reasoning types. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Conclusion: RSHR-Bench enables faithful assessment of remote sensing visual understanding and reasoning, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks and revealing that current multimodal models still struggle with super-high-resolution scenarios despite advances.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong perception and reasoning performance on existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks. However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Yunkaidang/RSHR

Abstract: Robust anatomical segmentation of chest X-rays (CXRs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive annotations and the substantial variability of real-world acquisition conditions. We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: InsertAnywhere successfully addresses key challenges in video object insertion through 4D scene understanding and appearance-faithful synthesis, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

TL;DR: ClothHMR is a novel 3D human mesh recovery method that handles diverse clothing by tailoring clothing to fit body silhouettes and leveraging visual information from foundational models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D human mesh recovery methods perform poorly with diverse clothing, especially loose garments, as they mainly focus on tight clothing. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a method that can accurately estimate body shapes and poses under various clothing conditions.

Method: ClothHMR consists of two main modules: 1) Clothing Tailoring (CT) module that uses body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor clothing to fit body silhouettes, and 2) FHVM-based Mesh Recovering (MR) module that optimizes 3D mesh parameters by aligning intermediate representations with those from a foundational human visual model (FHVM).

Result: ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images, accurately recovering 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing and precisely estimating body shapes and poses.

Conclusion: ClothHMR effectively addresses the challenge of 3D human mesh recovery under diverse clothing conditions through clothing tailoring and foundational model integration, demonstrating practical applications in online fashion and shopping scenarios.

Abstract: With 3D data rapidly emerging as an important form of multimedia information, 3D human mesh recovery technology has also advanced accordingly. However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) VLM-based feature extraction - extracts complementary visual and linguistic representations by aligning embeddings of captions from low/high-quality images using cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employs degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean content embeddings. 2) Diffusion-based image restoration - integrates these embeddings via cross-attention mechanisms in a diffusion model.

Result: Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific image restoration tasks, showing the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs.

Conclusion: The VLMIR framework effectively leverages vision-language priors from models like CLIP to enhance image restoration capabilities through improved visual perception and semantic understanding, addressing limitations of previous approaches in utilizing linguistic knowledge for semantic coherence.

Abstract: Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.

TL;DR: A unified Attention U-Net model was developed for automatic FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation across various brain tumor types and time points, achieving competitive performance compared to dataset-specific models and enabling clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic segmentation of FLAIR hyperintensity in brain MRI is clinically important for tumor volume assessment and edema measurement, but existing approaches often lack generalization across different tumor types and acquisition time points.

Method: Used ~5000 FLAIR images from various tumor types and acquisition time points across multiple centers to train a unified segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture, comparing performance against dataset-specific models and validating on different tumor types and time points including BraTS data.

Result: The unified model achieved Dice scores ranging from 61.27% to 90.92% across different tumor types and time points, with comparable performance to dataset-specific models while enabling generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points.

Conclusion: The unified Attention U-Net model provides robust FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation across diverse clinical scenarios, facilitating clinical deployment through integration into open-source Raidionics software for CNS tumor analysis.

Abstract: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of brain tumors. Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting. The model is integrated into Raidionics, an open-source software for CNS tumor analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiSIR-Net: A self-supervised reconstruction framework for high-resolution PCBA defect inspection using selective reconstruction gating and optimized patch selection to handle micro-defects in 4K images with insufficient labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated defect inspection of PCBAs is challenging due to insufficient labeled data, micro-defects (few pixels), visually-complex high-resolution images, and the need for practical 4K-resolution processing.

Method: HiSIR-Net combines: 1) Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that decides where to trust reconstruction vs. original input to reduce artifacts; 2) Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) with positional cues for coherent overlapping patch reconstructions across arbitrary resolutions.

Result: Method produces clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive rate. Outperforms existing methods on SIPCBA-500 dataset (500 self-collected images) and public benchmarks while maintaining practical processing speed.

Conclusion: HiSIR-Net effectively addresses PCBA defect inspection challenges through self-supervised reconstruction with selective gating and optimized patch selection, enabling practical high-resolution anomaly detection with minimal false positives.

Abstract: Automated defect inspection of assembled Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA) is quite challenging due to the insufficient labeled data, micro-defects with just a few pixels in visually-complex and high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed. Full code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Robust mammography registration is essential for clinical applications like tracking disease progression and monitoring longitudinal changes in breast tissue. However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration.

*Fanpu Cao,Yaofo Chen,Zeng You,Wei Luo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCache is a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that accelerates Diffusion Transformers by using non-uniform caching intervals and selective computation to reduce error accumulation, achieving up to 2.9x speedup with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have high computational costs that hinder real-time deployment. Existing feature caching methods use uniform intervals that don't match DiT's non-uniform temporal dynamics and cause error accumulation through naive feature reuse.

Method: ProCache has two core components: (1) constraint-aware caching pattern search that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling tailored to DiT's temporal characteristics, and (2) selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation.

Result: ProCache achieves up to 1.96x acceleration on PixArt-alpha and 2.90x acceleration on DiT with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

Conclusion: ProCache effectively addresses the limitations of uniform caching intervals and error accumulation in DiT acceleration, providing a training-free solution that aligns with the model's temporal dynamics while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

*Alexandre Personnic,Mihai Bâce*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-Gaze is a video-based gaze estimation model that combines CNN with attention modules to fuse eye and face features, treating them as spatial sequences to capture intra-frame context and inter-frame dynamics, achieving state-of-the-art results on EVE dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-based gaze estimation methods struggle to capture both spatial and temporal relationships effectively, as they need to handle feature representations within individual frames and across multiple frames simultaneously.

Method: Proposes Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze) combining CNN backbone with channel attention and self-attention modules to optimally fuse eye and face features. Fused features are treated as spatial sequences to capture intra-frame context, then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on EVE dataset both with and without person-specific adaptation. Ablation study shows preserving and modeling intra-frame spatial context with spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling.

Conclusion: ST-Gaze paves the way for more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics through attention mechanisms and spatio-temporal recurrence.

Abstract: Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generative framework for high-quality PBR textures on 3D meshes using fine-tuned VAE with material latent space and locality-preserving regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, and existing methods that freeze embedding networks cause distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels, hindering diffusion training.

Method: Fine-tune pretrained VAE to incorporate new material channels with minimal latent distribution deviation, and introduce locality-preserving regularization that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns corresponding image regions to maintain spatial correspondence.

Result: The framework improves PBR texture fidelity, with ablation studies showing each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, addressing distribution shift issues and ensuring cross-view consistency through locality preservation.

Abstract: We propose a generative framework for producing high-quality PBR textures on a given 3D mesh. As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: Analysis of conditioning methods for diffusion models in super-resolution, finding step size has greater impact than step count, with optimal range [2.0, 3.0].


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show strong potential for inverse problems like super-resolution, but conditioning methods (DPS, MCG) introduce hyperparameters that need careful tuning. The paper aims to identify dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models.

Method: Conducted empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to analyze conditioning methods. Compared different hyperparameters including conditioning step size and diffusion step count to determine their relative impact on reconstruction quality.

Result: Found that conditioning step size has significantly greater impact than diffusion step count. Step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielded the best overall performance in their experiments on FFHQ super-resolution.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for hyperparameter tuning in diffusion-based super-resolution, emphasizing the critical importance of conditioning step size over diffusion step count for optimal reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong potential for solving inverse problems such as single-image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution observation using a pretrained unconditional prior. Conditioning methods, including Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG), can substantially improve reconstruction quality, but they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning. In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to identify the dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models, and show that the conditioning step size has a significantly greater impact than the diffusion step count, with step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielding the best overall performance in our experiments.

### [48] [EMAG: Self-Rectifying Diffusion Sampling with Exponential Moving Average Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17303)
*Ankit Yadav,Ta Duc Huy,Lingqiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMAG is a training-free guidance method for diffusion transformers that uses exponential moving average statistics to adaptively select layers and generate harder negative samples, improving generation quality over CFG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance methods lack reliable control over negative sample granularity/difficulty and have fixed target-layer selection, limiting their ability to surface subtle failure modes for refinement.

Method: EMAG modifies attention at inference time using exponential moving average statistics with adaptive layer selection, producing harder but semantically faithful negative samples (fine-grained degradations).

Result: EMAG boosts quality and human preference score by +0.46 over CFG, surfaces difficult failure modes, and naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques like APG and CADS for further improvements.

Conclusion: EMAG provides a training-free, adaptive guidance mechanism that generates challenging negative samples to refine subtle artifacts, significantly improving diffusion transformer generation quality.

Abstract: In diffusion and flow-matching generative models, guidance techniques are widely used to improve sample quality and consistency. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.

TL;DR: DRIM enables deep, reliable multi-turn reasoning in vision-language models by incorporating self-reflection and correction mechanisms through a three-stage pipeline of data construction, supervised fine-tuning, and redundancy-penalized reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models with Chain-of-Thought reasoning struggle to reflect on and correct incorrect reasoning trajectories when analyzing visual inputs, limiting their reliability in complex visual tasks requiring multi-turn tool calls.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Construct high-difficulty, verifiable visual QA pairs requiring multi-turn tool calls; 2) Cold-start supervised fine-tuning using collected tool trajectories; 3) Redundancy-penalized RL optimization that penalizes incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration and encourages self-reflective reasoning patterns.

Result: DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks compared to existing models, demonstrating improved reliability and reasoning capabilities in complex visual tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed DRIM framework successfully addresses the self-reflection limitation in vision-language models by enabling deep, reliable multi-turn reasoning through a carefully designed pipeline that combines high-difficulty data construction, supervised learning, and redundancy-aware reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities on complex visual tasks by thinking with images in their Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is achieved by actively invoking tools to analyze visual inputs rather than merely perceiving them. However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: CodeDance uses executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning, enabling flexible tool orchestration and transparent reasoning with visual artifacts, outperforming existing approaches including GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-source approaches rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex visual reasoning tasks.

Method: CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts. It introduces a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call to balance exploration with efficiency and mitigate tool overuse.

Result: CodeDance consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, and surpasses advanced closed models like GPT-4o and larger open-source models across reasoning benchmarks (visual search, math, chart QA). It demonstrates novel emergent behaviors including novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CodeDance provides a general and scalable mechanism for executable visual reasoning, enabling transparent, self-checkable reasoning through code-based orchestration of tools and visual artifacts.

Abstract: Recent releases such as o3 highlight human-like "thinking with images" reasoning that combines structured tool use with stepwise verification, yet most open-source approaches still rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks. We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.

TL;DR: Pix2NPHM is a vision transformer network that directly regresses Neural Parametric Head Model parameters from single images, achieving high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction with unprecedented quality on in-the-wild data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural Parametric Head Models (NPHMs) offer high-fidelity geometric detail but are notoriously challenging to fit to visual inputs due to their expressive latent space. Existing approaches struggle with accurate facial geometry and expression reconstruction from single images.

Method: Proposes Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer network that directly regresses NPHM parameters from single images. Uses domain-specific ViTs pretrained on geometric prediction tasks as backbones. Trained on mixture of 3D data (100K+ NPHM registrations for direct SDF space supervision) and large-scale 2D video datasets (using normal estimates as pseudo ground truth). Enables inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps for improved geometric fidelity.

Result: Achieves unprecedented face reconstruction quality with more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions compared to existing approaches. Enables 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates and can run at scale on in-the-wild data.

Conclusion: Pix2NPHM successfully addresses the challenge of fitting expressive NPHMs to visual inputs, enabling high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction from single images with superior geometric accuracy and scalability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Neural Parametric Head Models (NPHMs) are a recent advancement over mesh-based 3d morphable models (3DMMs) to facilitate high-fidelity geometric detail. However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data.

*SuBeen Lee,GilHan Park,WonJun Moon,Hyun Seok Seong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADK enhances Vision-Language Models by using LLM-generated descriptive prompts as auxiliary knowledge, improving few-shot adaptation without computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with distribution shifts in downstream tasks, and existing PEFT methods rely on fixed prompts that don't capture class semantics well. Image-induced prompts help but add computational overhead.

Method: ADK uses LLMs to generate descriptive prompts offline, then deploys them as: 1) Compositional Knowledge (averaged representation for rich semantics), and 2) Instance-Specific Knowledge (lightweight attention selects relevant descriptions per image).

Result: ADK consistently boosts performance of multiple PEFT baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results across various scenarios without adding parameters or computational overhead.

Conclusion: ADK is an effective parameter-free plug-and-play component that enriches text representations for VLMs, improving few-shot adaptation by providing auxiliary descriptive knowledge alongside handcrafted prompts.

Abstract: Despite the impressive zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they often struggle in downstream tasks with distribution shifts from the pre-training data. Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AniX is a world model that combines static 3D scene generation with controllable character animation, allowing users to direct characters through natural language to perform diverse actions while preserving scene and character fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models have limitations: static world generation lacks active agents, while controllable-entity models only allow limited actions for single entities in otherwise uncontrollable environments. There's a need for models that combine realistic static environments with open-ended character control.

Method: AniX leverages static world generation realism and extends controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters performing open-ended actions. Users provide 3DGS scenes and characters, then direct characters through natural language. The system formulates this as conditional autoregressive video generation, built upon a pre-trained video generator with enhanced training strategy for better motion dynamics and generalization.

Result: AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with provided scenes and characters. The system enables diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring environments.

Conclusion: AniX bridges the gap between static world generation and limited controllable-entity models by enabling open-ended character control in realistic 3D environments through natural language instructions, with comprehensive evaluation covering visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have greatly enhanced interactive environment simulation. Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.

### [54] [EMMA: Concept Erasure Benchmark with Comprehensive Semantic Metrics and Diverse Categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17320)
*Lu Wei,Yuta Nakashima,Noa Garcia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMMA is a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates concept erasure methods across 12 metrics and 5 dimensions, revealing that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts, visually similar concepts, and can amplify bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in current concept erasure evaluation which uses limited concepts and simplistic prompts, and to test whether these methods truly remove concepts from model representations.

Method: Introduces EMMA benchmark with 12 metrics across 5 key dimensions: robustness to indirect descriptions, handling of visually similar non-target concepts, gender/ethnicity bias analysis, image quality, and time efficiency.

Result: Existing concept erasure methods struggle with implicit prompts (generating erased concepts when indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts, while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to original models.

Conclusion: Current concept erasure techniques have significant limitations in robustness and social awareness, highlighting the need for more comprehensive evaluation and improved methods that address implicit concept generation and bias amplification.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

*Sarah Rastegar,Violeta Chatalbasheva,Sieger Falkena,Anuj Singh,Yanbo Wang,Tejas Gokhale,Hamid Palangi,Hadi Jamali-Rad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfSplign is a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment in text-to-image diffusion models by adjusting noise through a compound loss using cross-attention maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture spatial relations specified in text prompts due to lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics.

Method: InfSplign is a training-free inference-time method that adjusts noise through a compound loss in every denoising step, leveraging different levels of cross-attention maps from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and balanced object presence.

Result: InfSplign establishes new state-of-the-art on VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks, achieving substantial performance gains over existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming fine-tuning-based methods.

Conclusion: InfSplign is a lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible training-free method that effectively improves spatial alignment in T2I diffusion models by leveraging cross-attention maps during inference.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods.

### [58] [DESSERT: Diffusion-based Event-driven Single-frame Synthesis via Residual Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17323)
*Jiyun Kong,Jun-Hyuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DESSERT is a diffusion-based framework for event-driven single-frame synthesis that uses residual training and a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to generate sharper, more temporally consistent future frames from event camera data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video frame prediction struggles with dynamic scenes due to lack of future frame information. Event cameras capture high-temporal-resolution brightness changes but existing event-based methods using optical flow prediction introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) Event-to-Residual Alignment VAE (ER-VAE) aligns event frames between anchor/target frames with corresponding residuals, (2) diffusion model denoises residual latent conditioned on event data. Uses Diverse-Length Temporal augmentation for robustness. Leverages pre-trained Stable Diffusion with residual training for temporal consistency.

Result: Outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods. Produces sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

Conclusion: DESSERT effectively addresses limitations of previous event-based video frame prediction methods by combining diffusion models with residual training and event data alignment, achieving superior frame synthesis quality and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

*Tomer Borreda,Fangqiang Ding,Sanja Fidler,Shengyu Huang,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadarGen is a diffusion model that generates realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera images, using BEV representations and visual cues to create physically plausible radar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the need for scalable multimodal generative simulation by creating realistic radar data from visual inputs, bridging the gap between camera and radar sensing modalities for autonomous driving applications.

Method: RadarGen adapts image-latent diffusion to radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form with RCS and Doppler attributes. It incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues from pretrained foundation models, and uses a lightweight recovery step to reconstruct point clouds from generated maps.

Result: Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, demonstrating improved radar data generation quality.

Conclusion: RadarGen represents a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities, offering a scalable approach compatible with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Researchers developed Polysome for synthetic instruction generation, created HISTAI-Instruct dataset with 1.1M instruction-response pairs from 24K slides, and trained ANTONI-α VLM that outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models for pathology have limitations: they focus on small regions, provide only static slide-level outputs, rely on non-public data limiting reproducibility, and lack training data with WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports, hindering transparent and generalizable VLMs.

Method: Three main contributions: 1) Polysome - standardized tool for synthetic instruction generation; 2) Applied Polysome to HISTAI dataset to create HISTAI-Instruct (24,259 slides, 1.1M instruction-response pairs); 3) Trained ANTONI-α VLM using HISTAI-Instruct for visual-question answering.

Result: ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks including tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. Performance of multiple ANTONI-α versions trained with different data amounts was compared. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

Conclusion: The work addresses key limitations in pathology VLMs by providing standardized synthetic instruction generation, creating a large public instruction tuning dataset, and demonstrating superior performance of the resulting ANTONI-α model on important pathology tasks, with full reproducibility through public release.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

### [61] [Adversarial Robustness of Vision in Open Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17902)
*Jonathon Fox,William J Buchanan,Pavlos Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial robustness of vision-language models LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2 against untargeted PGD attacks on visual inputs, finding that Llama 3.2 Vision shows better robustness despite lower baseline accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep learning models become more complex and opaque, adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities by modifying images to confuse AI recognition systems. The paper aims to understand the adversarial robustness of contemporary vision-language models against visual attacks.

Method: The researchers tested LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2 using untargeted Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks against the visual input modality. They empirically evaluated the models on a subset of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset and quantified attack results using standard VQA accuracy metrics.

Result: Llama 3.2 Vision, despite having lower baseline accuracy, exhibited smaller performance degradation under adversarial attacks compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Both models showed vulnerability to visual attacks, confirming the vision modality as a viable attack vector.

Conclusion: Vision modality represents a significant vulnerability for contemporary vision-language models. Adversarial robustness doesn't necessarily correlate with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by architectural and training factors. This highlights the need for robust evaluation beyond standard accuracy metrics.

Abstract: With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynergyWarpNet: An attention-guided cooperative warping framework for high-fidelity talking head synthesis that combines explicit warping with reference-augmented correction and confidence-guided fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explicit warping approaches struggle with accurate motion transfer and recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based methods suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. There's a need for a balanced approach that maintains geometric accuracy while handling occlusions effectively.

Method: Three-stage progressive refinement: 1) Explicit warping module using 3D dense optical flow for coarse spatial alignment; 2) Reference-augmented correction module using cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to complete occluded regions; 3) Confidence-guided fusion module with learned confidence maps for spatially-adaptive balancing of structural alignment and visual consistency.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in talking head synthesis.

Conclusion: SynergyWarpNet effectively addresses limitations of both explicit warping and attention-based methods by combining geometric grounding with semantic completion, achieving high-fidelity portrait animation for virtual avatars and digital content creation.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural portrait animation have demonstrated remarked potential for applications in virtual avatars, telepresence, and digital content creation. However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

*Ananta R. Bhattarai,Helge Rhodin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Re-Depth Anything is a test-time self-supervision framework that improves monocular depth estimation by fusing Depth Anything V2 with 2D diffusion models, using shape-from-shading cues and targeted optimization to bridge domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models like Depth Anything V2 struggle with real-world images that differ from their training distribution, creating a domain gap that limits their performance on diverse, out-of-distribution data.

Method: The framework performs label-free refinement by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting input images, replacing classical photometric reconstruction with shape-from-shading cues in a generative context using Score Distillation Sampling. It employs targeted optimization by freezing the encoder, updating only intermediate embeddings, and fine-tuning the decoder to prevent optimization collapse.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything achieves substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism compared to Depth Anything V2, demonstrating improved performance on real-world images far from training distribution.

Conclusion: The framework showcases new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning, effectively bridging domain gaps in monocular depth estimation through test-time refinement using diffusion model priors.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.

*Cuixin Yang,Rongkang Dong,Kin-Man Lam,Yuhang Zhang,Guoping Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDDN is a novel multi-level distortion-aware deformable network for omnidirectional image super-resolution that addresses latitude-dependent geometric distortions in equirectangular projections through parallel deformable attention and dilated convolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinders their ability to capture distorted patterns in ERP images where content is severely stretched near the poles due to latitude-dependent geometric distortion.

Method: Proposes MDDN with three parallel branches: deformable attention (dilation=1) and two dilated deformable convolutions (dilation rates 2 and 3) to expand sampling range and receptive field. Features are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module, with low-rank decomposition applied to reduce computational cost.

Result: Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in omnidirectional image super-resolution.

Conclusion: MDDN effectively addresses geometric distortions in ERP images by expanding sampling range and receptive field, generating comprehensive features that capture distorted patterns, resulting in superior ODISR performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: As augmented reality and virtual reality applications gain popularity, image processing for OmniDirectional Images (ODIs) has attracted increasing attention. OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR.

*Chenming Zhou,Jiaan Wang,Yu Li,Lei Li,Juan Cao,Sheng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pixel-level mapping pre-processing method that disrupts pixel value distributions to break semantic shortcuts, forcing AI-generated image detectors to focus on fundamental generative artifacts for better cross-generator generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detectors fail to generalize to images from unseen generative models because they overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts.

Method: Introduces a simple pixel-level mapping pre-processing step that disrupts pixel value distributions to break fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors exploit as shortcuts, forcing them to focus on fundamental high-frequency traces of the generation process.

Result: The approach significantly boosts cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors on both GAN and diffusion-based generators, with extensive analysis verifying that disrupting semantic cues is key to generalization.

Conclusion: Disrupting pixel-level semantic patterns through simple pre-processing enables AI-generated image detectors to focus on fundamental generative artifacts, achieving better generalization across different generative models.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative technologies necessitates reliable methods for detecting AI-generated images. A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media users express emotions through text with images, but there's a need to better reflect abstract emotional text into concrete visual representations that evoke specific emotions effectively.

Method: Introduces AIF dataset and task formulation, presents AIF-B as initial multi-modal transformer approach, then proposes AIF-D which extends AIF-B by leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models for deeper emotional reflection.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show AIF models achieve superior performance in content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. User studies demonstrate AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions.

Conclusion: The paper comprehensively discusses the value and potential of AIF models for creating emotionally compelling visual content from textual emotional expressions, with promising applications in social media and emotional content generation.

Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to express emotions by posting text with accompanying images. In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.

TL;DR: Researchers found a faster alternative to occlusion-based explanation methods for prostate cancer detection AI, reducing explanation time by at least 10x while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks in critical medical applications like cancer diagnosis need explainable outputs for clinical acceptance. Occlusion methods are widely used but computationally slow, hindering development and collaboration with pathologists.

Method: Developed a framework for comparing explanation methods by identifying suitable comparison criteria and metrics. Applied this framework to evaluate alternative explanation methods for a prostate cancer detection system.

Result: Found an alternative explanation method that reduced explanation time by at least a factor of 10 compared to occlusion, with no negative impact on output quality.

Conclusion: The speedup enables faster model development and debugging, bringing AI-assisted prostate cancer detection closer to clinical adoption. The evaluation framework can be applied to other applications needing explanation method comparisons.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are starting to show their worth in critical applications such as assisted cancer diagnosis. However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings. We propose that our approach to finding the replacement for occlusion can be used to evaluate candidate methods in other related applications.

TL;DR: AIFloodSense is a comprehensive global aerial flood imagery dataset with 470 high-resolution images from 230 flood events across 64 countries, supporting classification, segmentation, and VQA tasks for advancing flood detection AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current flood detection datasets are scarce, geographically limited, and lack annotation detail, hindering development of robust, generalized computer vision methods for disaster response and risk assessment.

Method: Created AIFloodSense dataset with 470 high-resolution aerial images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and 6 continents (2022-2024), supporting three tasks: image classification (environment type, camera angle, continent), semantic segmentation (flood, sky, buildings), and visual question answering for disaster assessment.

Result: Established baseline benchmarks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

Conclusion: AIFloodSense bridges the gap in flood detection datasets by providing comprehensive, globally diverse, and temporally relevant data that supports multiple complementary tasks, enabling development of more robust AI tools for climate resilience and disaster response.

Abstract: Accurate flood detection from visual data is a critical step toward improving disaster response and risk assessment, yet datasets for flood segmentation remain scarce due to the challenges of collecting and annotating large-scale imagery. Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

TL;DR: MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is a specialized vision-language model for smart-home environments that achieves strong performance on both home-scenario understanding and general multimodal reasoning through a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a vision-language model specialized for smart-home environments that balances specialization for home-scenario understanding with general multimodal reasoning capabilities, addressing the need for AI systems that can understand and reason about home activities and gestures while maintaining broad reasoning abilities.

Method: Built on MiMo-VL-7B backbone with two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning combined with reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization. Incorporates chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning for efficient learning and reasoning. Uses multi-domain data for training.

Result: Achieves leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and home-scenario understanding, with consistent gains on video benchmarks (Video-MME, Video-MMMU, Charades-STA) and language understanding benchmarks (MMMU-Pro, MMLU-Pro). Outperforms both closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Targeted home-scenario training enhances activity and gesture understanding while improving text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks. The model successfully balances specialization and generality, making it suitable for real-world smart-home applications. The open-source release supports research and deployment.

Abstract: We open-source \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B} and its quantized variant \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B-GGUF}, a pair of home-centric vision-language models that achieve strong performance on both home-scenario understanding and general multimodal reasoning. Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently. Our analysis shows that targeted home-scenario training not only enhances activity and gesture understanding, but also improves text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks. Model checkpoints, quantized GGUF weights, and our home-scenario evaluation toolkit are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco}{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco} to support research and deployment in real-world smart-home applications.

TL;DR: LangDriveCTRL is a framework for editing real driving videos using natural language instructions to create diverse traffic scenarios through 3D scene decomposition and agentic pipeline coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable natural-language-controlled editing of real-world driving videos for synthesizing diverse traffic scenarios with fine-grained control and realism.

Method: Uses 3D scene decomposition to represent videos as scene graphs, with an agentic pipeline where an Orchestrator transforms instructions into execution graphs coordinating specialized agents: Object Grounding Agent, Behavior Editing Agent, and Behavior Reviewer Agent, followed by video diffusion refinement.

Result: Achieves nearly 2× higher instruction alignment than previous state-of-the-art, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

Conclusion: LangDriveCTRL successfully enables natural-language-controlled editing of driving videos with improved instruction alignment and realism compared to existing methods.

Abstract: LangDriveCTRL is a natural-language-controllable framework for editing real-world driving videos to synthesize diverse traffic scenarios. It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

TL;DR: MULTIAQUA is a multimodal maritime dataset with synchronized RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR data for training robust vision systems that work in poor visibility conditions like nighttime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unmanned surface vehicles face challenging visual conditions (weather, lighting) where RGB cameras alone are insufficient. Need multimodal data to enable reliable scene interpretation regardless of visibility.

Method: Created MULTIAQUA dataset with synchronized, calibrated, annotated multimodal sensor data (RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR). Developed training approaches to train multimodal methods robustly using only daytime images.

Result: Evaluated multimodal methods on nighttime test set. Training approaches enable robust performance even in near-complete darkness while simplifying data acquisition and annotation.

Conclusion: MULTIAQUA dataset enables development of supervised multimodal methods for maritime scene interpretation that work reliably in challenging visibility conditions, with training approaches that reduce data collection complexity.

Abstract: Unmanned surface vehicles can encounter a number of varied visual circumstances during operation, some of which can be very difficult to interpret. While most cases can be solved only using color camera images, some weather and lighting conditions require additional information. To expand the available maritime data, we present a novel multimodal maritime dataset MULTIAQUA (Multimodal Aquatic Dataset). Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness. Our approach allows for training a robust deep neural network only using daytime images, thus significantly simplifying data acquisition, annotation, and the training process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene generation methods produce visually appealing results but lack artist-ready features like modifiable textured mesh scenes needed for visual effects and game development. Existing reconstruction methods suffer from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds.

Method: A compositional pipeline integrating state-of-the-art models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement. Uses generative models for occluded object inference with scene-level reasoning under consistent lighting/geometry. Features novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization for ground plane alignment and comprehensive background generation for spatial constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.

Conclusion: 3D-RE-GEN addresses artists' requirements by combining specialized domain models to create artist-ready textured 3D mesh scenes suitable for visual effects and game development workflows.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene generation produce visually appealing output, but current representations hinder artists' workflows that require modifiable 3D textured mesh scenes for visual effects and game development. Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.
  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for brain tumor segmentation require centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions due to data heterogeneity and confidentiality requirements.

Method: Proposes TwinSegNet, a federated learning framework integrating hybrid ViT-UNet models (convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks) with personalized digital twins.

Conclusion: TwinSegNet enables scalable, personalized brain tumor segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements, offering effective privacy preservation without sacrificing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is critical in diagnosis and treatment planning for the disease. Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements.

*Muhammad Atif Butt,Kai Wang,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiCtrl is a text-to-image personalization method that learns illuminant prompts from single object images to enable precise lighting control in generated scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is crucial for content designers to manipulate mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics in generated images.

Method: Three components: (1) physics-based illuminant augmentation along Planckian locus for fine-tuning variants, (2) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using frozen ControlNet to focus on illumination rather than structure, (3) masked reconstruction loss for foreground object focus with contextual background adaptation.

Result: LumiCtrl achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines, with strong user preference in human studies.

Conclusion: The method enables precise illuminant control from single object images through physics-based augmentation and illumination-focused learning, advancing T2I customization for lighting manipulation.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable progress in creative image generation, yet they still lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is a crucial factor for content designers aiming to manipulate the mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics of generated images. In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited modality coverage, restricting progress as approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities (images, text, coordinates) within a unified framework for comprehensive geo-spatial understanding.

Method: Introduces MMLANDMARKS dataset with one-to-one correspondence across four modalities: high-resolution aerial images, ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct US landmarks. Uses a simple CLIP-inspired baseline model for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across various geo-spatial tasks including cross-view retrieval, geolocalization, and text-to-image/GPS retrieval.

Conclusion: The MMLANDMARKS dataset enables training and benchmarking multimodal geo-spatial models, illustrating the necessity for comprehensive multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding beyond what current limited-modality benchmarks allow.

Abstract: Geo-spatial analysis of our world benefits from a multimodal approach, as every single geographic location can be described in numerous ways (images from various viewpoints, textual descriptions, and geographic coordinates). Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.

TL;DR: GroundingME benchmark reveals major gaps in MLLMs' visual grounding capabilities, showing models struggle with real-world complexity and hallucinate objects instead of rejecting ungroundable queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve high scores on existing benchmarks, but it's unclear if they truly understand visual grounding or just pattern-match on simplified datasets. Real-world visual grounding requires handling ambiguity, complex references, and recognizing when grounding is impossible.

Method: Created GroundingME benchmark with 1,005 challenging examples across four dimensions: Discriminative (similar objects), Spatial (complex relations), Limited (occlusions/tiny objects), and Rejection (ungroundable queries). Used automated generation with human verification. Evaluated 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs and explored two improvement strategies: test-time scaling via thinking trajectory and data-mixture training.

Result: Best model achieved only 45.1% accuracy, with most scoring 0% on rejection tasks (hallucinating objects instead of acknowledging absence). Test-time scaling improved complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and data-mixture training boosted rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%.

Conclusion: GroundingME reveals a profound capability gap in MLLMs' visual grounding, highlighting critical safety concerns from hallucination tendencies. The benchmark serves as both a diagnostic tool and roadmap toward human-level visual grounding, showing current models are far from sophisticated understanding.

Abstract: Visual grounding, localizing objects from natural language descriptions, represents a critical bridge between language and vision understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.

TL;DR: First external validation of AI prostate cancer diagnosis in Middle East (Iraq) shows pathologist-level performance with high cross-scanner consistency, supporting global AI adoption in pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI pathology systems have been validated mainly on Western populations, but global adoption requires validation in underrepresented regions where AI could have greatest impact. This study addresses the gap by evaluating AI in Middle Eastern population.

Method: Collected 339 prostate biopsy specimens from 185 consecutive patients (2013-2024) in Kurdistan, Iraq. Evaluated task-specific AI model and two foundation models against pathologist consensus, testing performance across three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, Grundium).

Result: AI-pathologist concordance (κ=0.801) matched pathologist-pathologist concordance (κ=0.799). High cross-scanner consistency (κ>0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.

Conclusion: AI achieves pathologist-level performance in prostate cancer assessment. Compact scanners enable validation in non-digitalized settings and cost-effective AI adoption. First open Middle East pathology dataset supports equitable global AI development.

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.
  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).
  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.
  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FALCON-SFOD is a new framework for Source-Free Object Detection that enhances object-focused adaptation under domain shift using foundation model regularization and noise-robust pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFOD methods rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling but suffer from domain shift reducing object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter and unreliable pseudo-labels. Prior works focus on refining pseudo-labels but overlook strengthening the feature space itself.

Method: FALCON-SFOD has two components: 1) SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) uses vision foundation models (OV-SAM) to generate class-agnostic binary masks that regularize the detector's feature space toward object regions. 2) IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) promotes balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance.

Result: The framework achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks, with theoretical analysis connecting the designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds.

Conclusion: FALCON-SFOD effectively addresses the core challenge of maintaining object-focused representations under domain shift in source-free object detection by combining foundation model regularization with noise-robust pseudo-labeling.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLEG is a feed-forward network that reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussians from arbitrary views without requiring 3D annotations, using 2D-to-3D lifting from uncalibrated multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods combining feed-forward reconstruction with Gaussian heads suffer from fixed input views and insufficient 3D training data. The authors aim to overcome these limitations by developing a 3D-annotation-free approach that can work with arbitrary views.

Method: Proposes a 3D-annotation-free training framework for 2D-to-3D lifting from arbitrary uncalibrated multi-view images. Uses large-scale video data with 2D instance information for semantic embedding, instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with 3D representations, and a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy to reduce computational costs.

Result: FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation from arbitrary sparse or dense views, producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics. Extensive experiments show it outperforms existing methods on various related tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed FLEG framework successfully addresses limitations of previous methods by enabling 3D reconstruction from arbitrary views without 3D annotations, leveraging large-scale 2D data, and achieving superior performance through novel training strategies.

Abstract: We present FLEG, a feed-forward network that reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussians from any views. Previous straightforward solutions combine feed-forward reconstruction with Gaussian heads but suffer from fixed input views and insufficient 3D training data. In contrast, we propose a 3D-annotation-free training framework for 2D-to-3D lifting from arbitrary uncalibrated and unposed multi-view images. Since the framework does not require 3D annotations, we can leverage large-scale video data with easily obtained 2D instance information to enrich semantic embedding. We also propose an instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with the 3D representations. In addition, to mitigate the high memory and computational cost of dense views, we further propose a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy. Our FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary sparse or dense views, jointly producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms existing methods on various related tasks. Project page: https://fangzhou2000.github.io/projects/fleg.

### [81] [G3Splat: Geometrically Consistent Generalizable Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17547)
*Mehdi Hosseinzadeh,Shin-Fang Chng,Yi Xu,Simon Lucey,Ian Reid,Ravi Garg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: G3Splat introduces geometric priors to address ambiguities in learning 3D Gaussian splats from view-synthesis supervision alone, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, pose estimation, and novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work on 3D Gaussian splatting relies almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision, which is insufficient for recovering geometrically meaningful splats. The authors identify ambiguities in learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting.

Method: G3Splat enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. The approach addresses the limitations of view-synthesis-only supervision by incorporating geometric constraints during training.

Result: Trained on RE10K, G3Splat achieves state-of-the-art performance in: (1) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (2) relative pose estimation, and (3) novel-view synthesis. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: Geometric priors are essential for learning meaningful 3D Gaussian splats from images. G3Splat successfully addresses the ambiguities of self-supervised learning for pose-free generalizable splatting, providing a more robust and geometrically consistent scene representation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an effective scene representation for real-time splatting and accurate novel-view synthesis, motivating several works to adapt multi-view structure prediction networks to regress per-pixel 3D Gaussians from images. However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation. Code and pretrained models are released on our project page (https://m80hz.github.io/g3splat/).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoomEditor++ is a diffusion-based architecture for virtual furniture synthesis that integrates reference objects into indoor scenes with geometric coherence and visual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual furniture synthesis has significant potential for home design and e-commerce, but remains underexplored due to lack of reproducible benchmarks and limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity synthesis while preserving background integrity.

Method: Proposes RoomEditor++ with a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures, unifying feature extraction and inpainting for reference and background images. Also introduces RoomBench++ dataset with 112,851 training and 1,832 testing pairs from real-world indoor videos and home design renderings.

Conclusion: RoomEditor++ provides an effective solution for virtual furniture synthesis with superior performance and generalization capabilities, supported by the comprehensive RoomBench++ benchmark dataset.

Abstract: Virtual furniture synthesis, which seamlessly integrates reference objects into indoor scenes while maintaining geometric coherence and visual realism, holds substantial promise for home design and e-commerce applications. However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

### [83] [3One2: One-step Regression Plus One-step Diffusion for One-hot Modulation in Dual-path Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17578)
*Ge Wang,Xing Liu,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel algorithm for video snapshot compressive imaging using one-hot modulation masks, transforming reconstruction into a generative video inpainting problem and introducing a diffusion-based framework with dual optical path hardware enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video SCI using random binary modulation causes temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation offers perfect temporal decoupling but lacks algorithms to exploit its potential. The authors aim to bridge this gap by developing specialized algorithms for one-hot masks.

Method: 1) Transform reconstruction into generative video inpainting using stochastic differential equations aligned with hardware compression. 2) Propose novel framework combining one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. 3) Implement dual optical path hardware to mitigate spatial degradation from one-hot modulation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing successful reconstruction without temporal aliasing issues present in random binary modulation approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first work integrating diffusion models into video SCI reconstruction, successfully leveraging one-hot modulation's temporal decoupling properties while addressing spatial degradation through hardware-level dual optical path design.

Abstract: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures dynamic scene sequences through a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot, fundamentally relying on optical modulation for hardware compression and the corresponding software reconstruction. While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes fairness in medical imaging AI benchmarks, finding substantial biases in dataset composition and accessibility issues that limit clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether medical imaging AI benchmarks provide sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable data to support clinically meaningful AI, examining fairness along two dimensions: representation of real-world clinical diversity and accessibility/reusability according to FAIR principles.

Method: Conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities, analyzing dataset composition biases and accessibility conditions.

Result: Found substantial biases in dataset composition (geographic location, modality, problem type), indicating inadequate reflection of real-world clinical diversity. Challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive access conditions, inconsistent licensing, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and reuse.

Conclusion: Current medical imaging AI benchmarks have foundational fairness limitations, exposing a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance due to unrepresentative datasets and accessibility barriers.

Abstract: Benchmarking competitions are central to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, defining performance standards and shaping methodological progress. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance.

### [85] [HeadHunt-VAD: Hunting Robust Anomaly-Sensitive Heads in MLLM for Tuning-Free Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17601)
*Zhaolin Cai,Fan Li,Ziwei Zheng,Haixia Bi,Lijun He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeadHunt-VAD is a tuning-free video anomaly detection method that identifies and uses specific attention heads within frozen multimodal LLMs instead of relying on textual outputs, achieving state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional VAD methods require extensive labeled data and have high computational costs. Existing MLLM-based tuning-free methods suffer from information loss, normalcy bias, and prompt sensitivity due to their reliance on textual outputs, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues.

Method: The method identifies robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within frozen MLLMs using a Robust Head Identification module that evaluates all attention heads through multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability. Features from selected expert heads are then processed by a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal locator.

Result: HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, demonstrating superior anomaly detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Head-level probing in MLLMs provides a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection, bypassing limitations of textual-output approaches and offering interpretable, efficient performance.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.

### [86] [Semi-Supervised 3D Segmentation for Type-B Aortic Dissection with Slim UNETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17610)
*Denis Mikhailapov,Vladimir Berikov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for multi-output CNN models in medical image segmentation, specifically for type B aortic dissection diagnosis, addressing the challenge of limited labeled 3D data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-output CNN models improve segmentation accuracy for medical images like aortic dissection, but require extensive labeled data which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain, especially for 3D CTA images. Semi-supervised learning can help but isn't well understood for multi-output models.

Method: A semi-supervised learning method based on additional rotations and flipping transformations, designed specifically for multi-output CNN models without assuming probabilistic model responses, making it universal for architectures with separate segmentation branches.

Result: The method is applied to the ImageTBDA dataset containing 100 3D CTA images for type B aortic dissection, segmenting three key classes: true lumen, false lumen, and false lumen thrombus, with 68 examples having false lumen pathology.

Conclusion: The proposed universal semi-supervised approach enables effective training of multi-output CNN models with limited labeled data, addressing the practical challenge of obtaining accurate 3D medical image annotations for improved aortic dissection diagnosis.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for multi-class segmentation of medical images are widely used today. Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.
  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.
  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.
  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses. This makes it a universal approach, which is especially important for architectures that involve separate segmentation.

TL;DR: Physics-informed self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution using routine HR weighted MRI as guidance, eliminating need for HR qMRI ground truth during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution quantitative MRI relaxometry provides objective tissue characterization but is clinically underutilized due to lengthy acquisition times. Need to enable fast qMRI acquisitions while maintaining quality.

Method: Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference framework minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. Uses deep neural network to learn super-resolution mapping from synthetic training data.

Result: Models trained on synthetic data produce super-resolved maps from 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to 5-minute reference scan. T1-weighted images enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters. Cross-qMRI sequence generalizability demonstrated on independently acquired in-vivo data.

Conclusion: Framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time by decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) quantitative MRI (qMRI) relaxometry provides objective tissue characterization but remains clinically underutilized due to lengthy acquisition times. We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters. By decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement, our framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering a practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoMV2D improves multi-view 3D object detection by integrating temporal stereo modeling with 2D detection-guided queries, enhancing depth perception through cross-temporal disparities while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the depth ambiguity limitation in single-frame 2D detections used for query initialization in multi-view 3D object detection, which restricts the accuracy of 3D query generation in existing methods like MV2D.

Method: StereoMV2D integrates temporal stereo modeling into 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detection by exploiting cross-temporal disparities of objects across adjacent frames. It refines query priors efficiently within 2D RoIs and includes a dynamic confidence gating mechanism that evaluates stereo cue reliability using inter-frame matching matrix patterns and appearance consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate superior detection performance without significant computational overhead compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: StereoMV2D effectively addresses depth ambiguity in 2D-guided 3D detection through temporal stereo modeling, achieving better accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

TL;DR: PathFLIP is a novel pathology vision-language framework that enables fine-grained WSI interpretation by decomposing slide captions into region-level subcaptions and generating text-conditioned embeddings, outperforming existing methods with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models struggle with gigapixel-scale Whole Slide Images due to spatial heterogeneity and difficulty capturing fine-grained correspondences between text and thousands of visual patches, limiting performance on downstream clinical tasks.

Method: PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions, generates text-conditioned region embeddings for precise visual-language grounding, leverages LLMs for clinical instruction following, and supports multiple paradigms including classification, retrieval, lesion localization, and instruction-aware interpretation.

Result: PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, demonstrating superior performance in slide-level classification, retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following.

Conclusion: PathFLIP paves the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice by addressing the challenges of gigapixel-scale pathology images through region-level caption decomposition and text-conditioned embeddings.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.

TL;DR: GRASP-HO reformulates HOI detection from closed-set classification to open-vocabulary generation using a frozen MLLM with lightweight cognitive steering and hybrid guidance for state-of-the-art closed-set and zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods operate under closed-world assumptions with predefined verb sets, struggling with unseen/ambiguous interactions. MLLMs have rich world knowledge but are computationally prohibitive to fine-tune for HOI detection.

Method: Proposes GRASP-HO: 1) Extracts hybrid interaction representations, 2) Uses lightweight cognitive steering conduit (CSC) to inject visual evidence into frozen MLLM, 3) Employs hybrid guidance strategy combining language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a unified paradigm that bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

Conclusion: GRASP-HO successfully reformulates HOI detection as open-vocabulary generation, leveraging frozen MLLMs with minimal learnable parameters to achieve both closed-set excellence and open-world generalization.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and the interactions between them. Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

*Zhongwei Zhang,Fuchen Long,Wei Li,Zhaofan Qiu,Wu Liu,Ting Yao,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCo introduces a new instructional video editing paradigm using in-context generation with constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions through joint denoising and regularization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While in-context generation works well for image editing, applying it to video editing faces challenges: inaccurate editing regions and token interference between editing/non-editing areas during denoising without specified editing regions.

Method: ReCo uses width-wise concatenation of source and target videos for joint denoising. It employs two regularization terms: latent regularization (increases latent discrepancy in editing regions, reduces in non-editing areas) and attention regularization (suppresses attention from editing region tokens to source video counterparts). Also creates ReCo-Data dataset with 500K instruction-video pairs.

Result: Extensive experiments on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of ReCo's approach.

Conclusion: ReCo presents an effective instructional video editing paradigm that addresses key challenges in in-context video generation through constraint modeling and regularization techniques, supported by a large-scale dataset for training.

Abstract: The In-context generation paradigm recently has demonstrated strong power in instructional image editing with both data efficiency and synthesis quality. Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.

Motivation: Despite advances in AI enabling granular behavioral quantification from video, mainstream adoption in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research remains slow due to technical barriers, specialized software requirements, and lack of hypothesis-driven measurement tools accessible to non-engineers.

Method: Bitbox provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video using multiple face, head, and body processors. It follows principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability, with core modules tested and validated on clinical samples, designed for easy addition of new measures.

Result: Bitbox bridges the translational gap by giving behavioral researchers access to robust behavioral metrics without engineering expertise while providing computer scientists a practical dissemination mechanism. It's designed as a community-driven effort to evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

Conclusion: Bitbox is expected to accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research by removing technical barriers and making advanced AI-based analysis directly usable by domain researchers.

Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

TL;DR: FlexAvatar is a flexible 3D head avatar reconstruction model that creates high-fidelity avatars with detailed dynamic deformations from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create practical animatable 3D avatars from minimal input (single or sparse images) without requiring camera poses or expression labels, while achieving detailed dynamic deformations and handling rare expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth.

Method: Uses transformer-based reconstruction with structured head query tokens as canonical anchors to aggregate flexible inputs; lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps for real-time detailed deformations; data distribution adjustment to balance rare expressions; and optional 10-second refinement for identity-specific details.

Result: Achieves superior 3D consistency and detailed dynamic realism compared to previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation with real-time deformation capabilities.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar offers a flexible, practical approach to creating high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformations from minimal input, addressing challenges of camera-pose-free, expression-free reconstruction while handling rare expressions and enabling real-time animation.

Abstract: We present FlexAvatar, a flexible large reconstruction model for high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformation from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels. It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation.

TL;DR: SAVeD is a large-scale video dataset from social media capturing ADAS vehicle crashes, near-misses, and disengagements, enabling safety-critical research with real-world edge cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack authentic ADAS vehicle behavior under risk conditions, being limited to simulated environments or human-driven data, creating a gap for safety-critical research.

Method: Curated 2,119 first-person videos from social media with frame-level annotations; proposed TTC computation framework using semantic segmentation and depth estimation; used GEV distribution for risk modeling; benchmarked VLLMs with domain adaptation.

Result: Created comprehensive dataset capturing diverse scenarios; demonstrated utility through TTC analysis, risk quantification across roadway types, and improved VLLM performance in complex near-miss scenarios.

Conclusion: SAVeD addresses the critical need for real-world ADAS risk data, enabling advanced safety research and providing valuable benchmarks for autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The advancement of safety-critical research in driving behavior in ADAS-equipped vehicles require real-world datasets that not only include diverse traffic scenarios but also capture high-risk edge cases such as near-miss events and system failures. However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types. (3) We establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2 and InternVL2.5 HiCo R16), showing that SAVeD's detailed annotations significantly enhance model performance through domain adaptation in complex near-miss scenarios.

*Qian Zeng,Yihui Wang,Shu Yang,Yingxue Xu,Fengtao Zhou,Jiabo Ma,Dejia Cai,Zhengyu Zhang,Lijuan Qu,Yu Wang,Li Liang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaMIL+ is a new multiple instance learning framework for whole-slide image analysis that integrates spatial context modeling while maintaining long-range dependencies without memory decay, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 20 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole-slide images present challenges due to gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations. While MIL addresses this by treating WSIs as bags of patches, and Mamba offers efficient long sequence learning, both suffer from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay issues in WSI analysis.

Method: MambaMIL+ introduces three key components: 1) overlapping scanning to restructure patch sequences with spatial continuity, 2) selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) to encode positional information while mitigating fixed scanning order biases, and 3) contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism that uses supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge contextual memory for stable long-range modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three different feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH).

Conclusion: MambaMIL+ effectively addresses the limitations of existing MIL and Mamba approaches for WSI analysis by integrating spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting, proving to be an effective and robust framework for large-scale computational pathology.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology

*Yichen Jiang,Mohammed Talha Alam,Sohail Ahmed Khan,Duc-Tien Dang-Nguyen,Fakhri Karray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-Gen, a large-scale diffusion-generated fake dataset, and AdaptPrompt, a CLIP-based parameter-efficient framework for generalizable deepfake detection across diverse generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing realism of synthetic media makes deepfake detection challenging, especially due to poor generalization of detectors trained on narrow generator classes when faced with unseen models.

Method: 1) Created Diff-Gen dataset with 100k diffusion-generated fakes capturing broad spectral artifacts; 2) Proposed AdaptPrompt framework that learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping CLIP backbone frozen; 3) Used layer ablation to prune final transformer block of vision encoder to retain high-frequency generative artifacts.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging test sets covering GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools. Demonstrated strong cross-domain generalization, few-shot learning capability (with as few as 320 images), and source attribution for generator identification.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, generalizable solution for deepfake detection that works across diverse generative techniques, addressing the critical need for detectors that can handle unseen synthetic content generation methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to the widespread availability of highly realistic synthetic media, increasing the difficulty of reliable deepfake detection. A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.

*Arya Chavoshi,Hassan Dashtian,Naveen Sudharsan,Dev Niyogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanDIFF: A denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud-contaminated urban land surface temperature imagery using spatial conditioning and pixel-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud contamination frequently obscures satellite-derived LST observations, limiting continuous SUHI monitoring. Existing methods rely on temporal or multi-sensor data that may be unavailable under persistent cloud cover, while traditional spatial methods degrade with large gaps.

Method: UrbanDIFF is a purely spatial denoising diffusion model conditioned on static urban structure information (built-up surface data and digital elevation model). It enforces consistency with cloud-free pixels through supervised pixel-guided refinement during inference.

Result: UrbanDIFF outperforms interpolation baselines, especially under dense cloud occlusion (85% coverage). Achieves SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85% cloud coverage, with slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

Conclusion: Denoising diffusion models offer robust spatial reconstruction for cloud-contaminated urban LST imagery, enabling improved SUHI monitoring under challenging cloud conditions without requiring temporal or multi-sensor data.

Abstract: Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) products are central to surface urban heat island (SUHI) monitoring due to their consistent grid-based coverage over large metropolitan regions. However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.
  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.
  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

*Ami Pandat,Punna Rajasekhar,G. Aravamuthan,Gopika Vinod,Rohit Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid camera distortion modeling framework combining extended conventional models with neural network residual correction for long-range 3D localization up to 5km.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stereo-camera 3D localization methods are limited to few hundred meters due to inadequate distortion models for camera lens nonlinearities, especially for long-distance photogrammetry applications.

Method: Hybrid approach: first extend conventional distortion models with higher-order terms, then enhance using neural network-based residual correction model to better capture complex lens distortion functions.

Result: Substantially improved long-range localization performance, capable of estimating 3D position of objects up to 5 kilometers. Estimated coordinates transformed to GIS coordinates and visualized on GIS maps.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework offers robust and effective calibration for CCTV cameras in long-range photogrammetry applications, overcoming limitations of traditional distortion models.

Abstract: Accurate camera models are essential for photogrammetry applications such as 3D mapping and object localization, particularly for long distances. Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chorus is a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models, enabling rich feature extraction for various 3D tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. The paper aims to address this gap by learning comprehensive scene representations from 3DGS data.

Method: Chorus employs a multi-teacher pretraining framework with a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to distill complementary signals from 2D foundation models. It learns from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers to create a shared embedding space capturing signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. The method also includes a render-and-distill adaptation for out-of-domain finetuning.

Result: Chorus shows strong performance on open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, and data-efficient supervision. A point cloud variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, and estimated normals outperforms point cloud baselines while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. The method demonstrates effective transfer learning capabilities.

Conclusion: Chorus successfully learns a holistic 3DGS scene encoder through multi-teacher distillation, enabling rich feature extraction that transfers well to various 3D tasks and outperforms existing methods with significantly less training data.

Abstract: While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.
  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autonomous coding agents built on LLMs struggle with complex, domain-specific scientific problems like medical imaging, which require specialized knowledge, long training cycles, and complex workflows not covered by existing benchmarks.

Method: Created ReX-MLE benchmark with 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions across diverse modalities and task types, evaluating full end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic constraints.

Result: State-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with various LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude) performed poorly, with most submissions ranking in the 0th percentile compared to human experts, revealing domain-knowledge and engineering limitations.

Conclusion: ReX-MLE exposes critical bottlenecks in current autonomous AI systems for specialized domains and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems that can handle complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures stem from domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE exposes these bottlenecks and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems.

Motivation: Raman spectroscopy is valuable for biomedical diagnostics but faces challenges from weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background in biological tissues, which degrade signal quality.

Method: Developed a simulation-driven denoising framework combining statistically grounded noise modeling with deep learning. Generated biologically realistic Raman spectra using comprehensive noise models, then trained a cascaded deep neural network to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference.

Result: Validated the approach using simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data. The framework demonstrated potential for improving spectral quality and enabling faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.

Conclusion: Physics-informed deep learning can effectively enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions, addressing key challenges in biomedical Raman spectroscopy applications.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular analysis with high specificity, making it a powerful tool for biomedical diagnostics. However, its application to biological tissues is challenged by inherently weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background, which significantly degrade signal quality. In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as a validation case study. Our results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed learning to improve spectral quality and enable faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.

TL;DR: InSPECT is a novel diffusion model that preserves invariant spectral features during both forward and backward processes, achieving better generation quality, diversity, and faster convergence compared to standard diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models diffuse data all the way to white noise, creating an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by preserving important spectral features throughout the diffusion process.

Method: InSPECT keeps invariant spectral features during both forward and backward diffusion processes. At the end of the forward process, Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to specified random noise, enabling feature preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN show InSPECT achieves average 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations. The model demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and smoother diffusion process.

Conclusion: Preserving invariant spectral features in diffusion models leads to superior generation quality and diversity while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence. This is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

Abstract: Modern diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are surprisingly fragile to visual prompting details like marker color/size, which can completely change leaderboard rankings; VPBench is introduced as a more stable benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluation benchmarks using visual prompting are unstable - small changes in visual markers (color, size) dramatically affect model rankings, making evaluations unreliable.

Method: Evaluated 9 open/closed-source VLMs on visually prompted tasks, tested effects of marker design, dataset size, JPEG compression; created VPBench with 16 marker variants for more stable evaluation.

Result: Visual prompting details significantly influence model performance and rankings; marker changes can lift weaker models above stronger ones; JPEG compression also affects rankings; visual prompting benchmarks are much more sensitive than conventional semantic evaluations.

Conclusion: Current visually prompted benchmarks are unstable; VPBench provides a more robust evaluation framework; benchmarking practices need to account for visual prompting sensitivity.

Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants. VPBench and additional analysis tools are released at https://lisadunlap.github.io/vpbench/.

TL;DR: KCCs transform any pre-trained Vision Transformer into a self-explainable model without retraining by leveraging ViTs' ability to identify matching keypoints between images, creating an interpretable visual decision process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-explainable models require complex training and specific architectures, making them impractical, especially for Vision Transformer-based foundation models. There's a need for methods to provide transparency and reliability to these powerful models without extensive retraining.

Method: Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs) - a method that transforms any well-trained ViT-based model into a self-explainable model without retraining. It builds on ViTs' ability to automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, creating an interpretable decision process that can be visualized directly in the input.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows that KCCs improve human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. The method successfully makes ViT-based models more transparent without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

Conclusion: KCCs represent an important step toward making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable by providing an interpretable, visual decision process that works with existing pre-trained models without modification.

Abstract: Current approaches for designing self-explainable models (SEMs) require complicated training procedures and specific architectures which makes them impractical. With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.

Motivation: Modeling multi-person interactions is challenging due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing methods are largely task-specific and don't generalize to flexible multi-agent generation needed for robotics and social computing applications.

Method: MAGNet uses an autoregressive diffusion framework with modifications to explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. It supports dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, with a scalable architecture agnostic to the number of agents.

Result: MAGNet performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people. It captures both tightly synchronized activities (dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions, and can generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of frames.

Conclusion: MAGNet provides a unified framework for multi-agent motion generation that addresses the limitations of existing task-specific methods, offering flexible conditioning and sampling for a wide range of interaction tasks with variable group sizes.

Abstract: Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/

### [106] [Dexterous World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17907)
*Byungjun Kim,Taeksoo Kim,Junyoung Lee,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dexterous World Model (DWM) is a video diffusion framework that generates realistic human-scene interaction videos from static 3D scenes and egocentric hand motions, enabling interactive digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital twins are static and lack embodied interactivity, limiting them to navigation and view synthesis. The paper aims to bridge this gap by modeling how human actions dynamically change 3D scenes.

Method: DWM uses a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that conditions generation on: (1) static scene renderings following camera trajectories for spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings encoding geometry and motion cues. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining synthetic egocentric interactions (for aligned supervision) and real-world fixed-camera videos (for diverse object dynamics).

Result: DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions like grasping, opening, and moving objects while maintaining camera and scene consistency. The framework produces realistic and physically plausible interactions.

Conclusion: DWM represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions, moving beyond static digital twins to interactive environments.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.
  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.
  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.

### [107] [Both Semantics and Reconstruction Matter: Making Representation Encoders Ready for Text-to-Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17909)
*Shilong Zhang,He Zhang,Zhifei Zhang,Chongjian Ge,Shuchen Xue,Shaoteng Liu,Mengwei Ren,Soo Ye Kim,Yuqian Zhou,Qing Liu,Daniil Pakhomov,Kai Zhang,Zhe Lin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to adapt discriminative encoder features for generative tasks by introducing semantic-pixel reconstruction to create compact, semantically-rich latent spaces that enable state-of-the-art image reconstruction and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDMs use VAE latents optimized for pixel reconstruction but lack semantic understanding. Using discriminative encoder features for generation faces two problems: (1) lack of compact regularization leading to inaccurate structures, and (2) weak pixel-level reconstruction hindering fine-grained details.

Method: Introduces semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize latent space, compressing both semantic information and fine details into compact representation (96 channels, 16x16 downsampling). Uses this representation to build unified T2I and image editing model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks compared to various feature spaces.

Conclusion: Representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components through proper regularization, enabling unified vision generation and understanding with compact, semantically-rich latent spaces.

Abstract: Modern Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) typically operate in low-level Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent spaces that are primarily optimized for pixel-level reconstruction. To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Women's Health Benchmark (WHB) reveals that current LLMs have ~60% failure rates in women's health domains, with significant gaps across medical specialties and error types, particularly in detecting urgency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become primary health information sources for millions, their accuracy in women's health remains critically unexamined, necessitating specialized evaluation benchmarks.

Method: Created WHB with 96 validated model stumps covering 5 medical specialties, 3 query types, and 8 error types, then evaluated 13 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: Models show ~60% failure rates on women's health, with dramatic performance variations across specialties and error types; models universally struggle with "missed urgency" indicators, though newer models like GPT-5 show improvements in avoiding inappropriate recommendations.

Conclusion: AI chatbots are not yet fully capable of providing reliable women's health advice, highlighting critical safety gaps that need addressing before widespread clinical deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become primary sources of health information for millions, their accuracy in women's health remains critically unexamined. We introduce the Women's Health Benchmark (WHB), the first benchmark evaluating LLM performance specifically in women's health. Our benchmark comprises 96 rigorously validated model stumps covering five medical specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, primary care, oncology, and neurology), three query types (patient query, clinician query, and evidence/policy query), and eight error types (dosage/medication errors, missing critical information, outdated guidelines/treatment recommendations, incorrect treatment advice, incorrect factual information, missing/incorrect differential diagnosis, missed urgency, and inappropriate recommendations). We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art LLMs and revealed alarming gaps: current models show approximately 60\% failure rates on the women's health benchmark, with performance varying dramatically across specialties and error types. Notably, models universally struggle with "missed urgency" indicators, while newer models like GPT-5 show significant improvements in avoiding inappropriate recommendations. Our findings underscore that AI chatbots are not yet fully able of providing reliable advice in women's health.

*Khushboo Thaker,Yony Bresler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Struct-SQL: A knowledge distillation framework using structured query execution plans to teach small language models Text-to-SQL, achieving 8.1% improvement over unstructured CoT distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise Text-to-SQL systems face a trilemma between cost, security, and performance, forcing choices between expensive proprietary LLMs and low-performing SLMs. Current SLM improvement methods using unstructured CoT traces are ambiguous and unreliable for precise SQL generation.

Method: Proposed Struct-SQL, a knowledge distillation framework that trains SLMs to emulate large LLMs using structured reasoning via query execution plans as formal blueprints, providing clearer teaching signals than unstructured CoT.

Result: SLM distilled with structured CoT achieves 8.1% absolute improvement over unstructured CoT distillation baseline. Error analysis shows key gain comes from marked reduction in syntactic errors.

Conclusion: Teaching models to reason using structured logical blueprints is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs, demonstrating formal structured reasoning provides clearer, more reliable teaching signals than unstructured approaches.

Abstract: Deploying accurate Text-to-SQL systems at the enterprise level faces a difficult trilemma involving cost, security and performance. Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.

*Dhruvesh Patel,Durga Prasad Maram,Sai Sreenivas Chintha,Benjamin Rozonoyer,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XLM package provides standardized tools for implementing and comparing non-autoregressive language models, addressing the lack of unified frameworks in this emerging field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-autoregressive text generation lacks standardized training/inference libraries compared to autoregressive approaches, making systematic comparisons difficult and implementation cumbersome with bespoke solutions.

Method: Developed XLM Python package to streamline implementation of small non-autoregressive language models with reusable components for data collation, loss functions, and prediction logic.

Result: Created open-source XLM package with companion xlm-models package providing pre-trained models for research community use.

Conclusion: XLM package facilitates faster development of non-autoregressive language models and enables better comparison of different methods through standardized implementation framework.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in non-autoregressive text generation in the context of general language modeling. Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community. The code is available at https://github.com/dhruvdcoder/xlm-core.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPECTRA is a watermarking method that makes training data detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of training corpus, using LLM paraphrasing and scoring models to avoid distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce copyright and data licensing for LLMs trained on massive internet-scraped corpora by making training data reliably detectable through watermarking.

Method: Paraphrases text using an LLM, assigns scores based on paraphrase likelihood via a separate scoring model, chooses paraphrases matching original text scores to avoid distribution shifts, then compares suspect model's token probabilities against scoring model.

Result: Achieves consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting training data vs non-training data, outperforming all baselines tested.

Conclusion: SPECTRA provides data owners with scalable, deploy-before-release watermarking that survives large-scale LLM training, enabling effective copyright enforcement.

Abstract: Training data detection is critical for enforcing copyright and data licensing, as Large Language Models (LLM) are trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet. We present SPECTRA, a watermarking approach that makes training data reliably detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of the training corpus. SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model. We demonstrate that SPECTRA achieves a consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting data used for training versus data not used for training, which is greater than all baselines tested. SPECTRA equips data owners with a scalable, deploy-before-release watermark that survives even large-scale LLM training.

### [112] [When F1 Fails: Granularity-Aware Evaluation for Dialogue Topic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17083)
*Michael H. Coen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation metrics for dialogue topic segmentation, showing that reported performance differences are driven by annotation granularity mismatches rather than model quality. It introduces new evaluation criteria focusing on boundary density and segment coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation relies on strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, which are inadequate for modern LLM-based conversational systems that use segmentation to manage conversation history beyond fixed context windows. These metrics fail to capture the true quality of segmentation needed for practical applications.

Method: The paper introduces a new evaluation objective treating boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). It evaluates multiple dialogue segmentation strategies across eight diverse dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions.

Result: The study shows that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels, not by model quality. High segment coherence is observed alongside extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores.

Conclusion: Topic segmentation should be understood as selecting appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. The paper operationalizes this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection, advocating for evaluation metrics that better reflect practical segmentation needs.

Abstract: Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.
  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.
  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.

### [113] [Data Augmentation Supporting a Conversational Agent Designed for Smoking Cessation Support Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17092)
*Salar Hashemitaheri,Ian Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two-level data augmentation (synthetic + real) improves intent classification for smoking cessation chatbots when training data is scarce.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online smoking cessation support groups suffer from low engagement and stigma; conversational agents could help but need better intent classification, which is hampered by insufficient high-quality training data.

Method: 1) Fine-tuned open-source LLM to classify posts and identify low-F1 intents; 2) Generated synthetic data via GPT prompt engineering for weak intents; 3) Scraped real posts from related contexts; 4) Human validation of all new data; 5) Retrained classifier on augmented dataset.

Result: Synthetic data: 87% high quality, 43% of original posts augmented with 140% expansion. Real data: 73% of 10,000+ scraped posts validated. Retrained model showed 32% F1 improvement, with both augmentation types contributing similarly.

Conclusion: The two-level data augmentation framework effectively addresses data scarcity in conversational agent development, providing a replicable approach for domains with limited training data.

Abstract: Online support groups for smoking cessation are economical and accessible, yet they often face challenges with low user engagement and stigma. The use of an automatic conversational agent would improve engagement by ensuring that all user comments receive a timely response.). We address the challenge of insufficient high-quality data by employing a two-level data augmentation strategy: synthetic data augmentation and real data augmentation. First, we fine-tuned an open source LLM to classify posts from our existing smoking cessation support groups and identify intents with low F1 (precision+recall) scores. Then, for these intents, we generate additional synthetic data using prompt engineering with the GPT model, with an average of 87\% of the generated synthetic posts deemed high quality by human annotators. Overall, the synthetic augmentation process resulted in 43\% of the original posts being selected for augmentation, followed by 140\% synthetic expansion of these posts. Additionally, we scraped more than 10,000 real posts from a related online support context, of which 73\% were validated as good quality by human annotators. Each synthetic or scraped post underwent rigorous validation involving human reviewers to ensure quality and relevance. The validated new data, combined with the original support group posts, formed an augmented dataset used to retrain the intent classifier. Performance evaluation of the retrained model demonstrated a 32\% improvement in F1, confirming the effectiveness of our data augmentation approach. Synthetic and real post augmentation led to similar performance improvements. This study provides a replicable framework for enhancing conversational agent performance in domains where data scarcity is a critical issue.

TL;DR: Highlight-guided generation uses sentence-level content planning to improve faithfulness and traceability in long document summarization, with two-stage pipeline performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve factual consistency and faithfulness in long document summarization by making the generation process more traceable and grounded in source content.

Method: Self-planning methods identify important content at sentence level, then generate summaries conditioned on this content plan. Both end-to-end and two-stage variants explored.

Result: Method consistently improves factual consistency while preserving relevance and quality. On GovReport: +4.1 ROUGE-L points, ~35% gains in SummaC scores. Two-stage pipeline better for long, information-dense documents.

Conclusion: Highlight-guided summarization helps preserve important details, leading to more accurate and insightful summaries across domains, with the two-stage approach being particularly effective for complex documents.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for long context summarisation, highlight-guided generation, that leverages sentence-level information as a content plan to improve the traceability and faithfulness of generated summaries. Our framework applies self-planning methods to identify important content and then generates a summary conditioned on the plan. We explore both an end-to-end and two-stage variants of the approach, finding that the two-stage pipeline performs better on long and information-dense documents. Experiments on long-form summarisation datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improves factual consistency while preserving relevance and overall quality. On GovReport, our best approach has improved ROUGE-L by 4.1 points and achieves about 35% gains in SummaC scores. Qualitative analysis shows that highlight-guided summarisation helps preserve important details, leading to more accurate and insightful summaries across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiA-RAG introduces mindscape-aware retrieval-augmented generation that uses hierarchical summarization to create global semantic representations, improving long-context understanding by aligning local details with coherent global context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems lack holistic semantic guidance for long-context tasks, unlike humans who use global representations (mindscapes) to organize knowledge and integrate dispersed evidence.

Method: MiA-RAG builds mindscapes through hierarchical summarization, then conditions both retrieval and generation on these global semantic representations to form enriched query embeddings and enable coherent reasoning.

Result: MiA-RAG consistently surpasses baselines across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making, showing better alignment of local details with global representations.

Conclusion: The approach enables more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning by equipping LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness through mindscape construction.

Abstract: Humans understand long and complex texts by relying on a holistic semantic representation of the content. This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making. It consistently surpasses baselines, and further analysis shows that it aligns local details with a coherent global representation, enabling more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning.

*Zahra Rahmani,Hossein Sameti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework for Persian speech that uses multiple hypotheses and Error Level Noise (ELN) embeddings to improve Whisper's performance in noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR systems degrade significantly in noisy environments, especially for low-resource languages like Persian. Even state-of-the-art models like Whisper struggle with varying SNRs, requiring robust error correction methods.

Method: Proposes a framework combining multiple hypotheses from modified Whisper-large decoder with noise-aware modeling. Introduces Error Level Noise (ELN) to capture semantic/token-level disagreement across hypotheses. Evaluates three models: base LLaMA-2-7B, fine-tuned text-only variant, and noise-conditioned model with ELN embeddings at sentence/word levels.

Result: ELN-conditioned model achieved substantial WER reductions. On Mixed Noise test set: reduced WER from 31.10% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84%, significantly surpassing fine-tuned text-only baseline (30.79%). Base LLaMA-2-7B increased WER to 64.58%, showing inability to correct Persian errors alone.

Conclusion: Combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware ELN embeddings effectively improves robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems suffer significant performance degradation in noisy environments, a challenge that is especially severe for low-resource languages such as Persian. Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.

Motivation: While LLMs have advanced in generating mathematical proofs, formal theorem proving in languages like Lean remains challenging and computationally expensive, especially for undergraduate-level and beyond problems.

Method: Uses large-scale agentic reinforcement learning where the model continuously accumulates experience through interactions with Lean and other tools, plus an efficient test-time scaling workflow that bridges natural and formal languages.

Result: Achieves 88% on PutnamBench (undergraduate), 80% on Fate-H (graduate), and 33% on Fate-X (PhD-level). Solved 11 out of 12 Putnam 2025 problems within 9 hours, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with smaller compute budget.

Conclusion: Scaling learning from experience driven by high-quality formal feedback shows immense potential for the future of formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models have recently made significant progress to generate rigorous mathematical proofs. In contrast, utilizing LLMs for theorem proving in formal languages (such as Lean) remains challenging and computationally expensive, particularly when addressing problems at the undergraduate level and beyond. In this work, we present \textbf{Seed-Prover 1.5}, a formal theorem-proving model trained via large-scale agentic reinforcement learning, alongside an efficient test-time scaling (TTS) workflow. Through extensive interactions with Lean and other tools, the model continuously accumulates experience during the RL process, substantially enhancing the capability and efficiency of formal theorem proving. Furthermore, leveraging recent advancements in natural language proving, our TTS workflow efficiently bridges the gap between natural and formal languages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Seed-Prover 1.5 achieves superior performance with a smaller compute budget. It solves \textbf{88\% of PutnamBench} (undergraduate-level), \textbf{80\% of Fate-H} (graduate-level), and \textbf{33\% of Fate-X} (PhD-level) problems. Notably, using our system, we solved \textbf{11 out of 12 problems} from Putnam 2025 within 9 hours. Our findings suggest that scaling learning from experience, driven by high-quality formal feedback, holds immense potential for the future of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Michael J. Ryan,Yanzhe Zhang,Amol Salunkhe,Yi Chu,Di Xu,Diyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMetrics is a framework for synthesizing evaluation metrics for AI applications using retrieval from a curated metric bank and LLM-generated criteria, requiring minimal human feedback to create interpretable automatic metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating user-facing AI applications in open-ended domains is challenging due to scarce user feedback and slow behavioral signals, making it difficult to optimize systems during prototyping and research phases.

Method: AutoMetrics combines retrieval from MetricBank (48 curated metrics) with automatically generated LLM-as-a-Judge criteria informed by lightweight human feedback, then composes metrics via regression to maximize correlation with human signals.

Result: Across 5 diverse tasks, AutoMetrics improves Kendall correlation with human ratings by up to 33.4% over LLM-as-a-Judge while requiring fewer than 100 feedback points, and can serve as an effective proxy reward comparable to verifiable rewards.

Conclusion: AutoMetrics provides a practical solution for creating interpretable automatic evaluation metrics from limited human feedback, accelerating adaptive evaluation of LLM applications, with the toolkit and MetricBank released to support broader adoption.

Abstract: Evaluating user-facing AI applications remains a central challenge, especially in open-ended domains such as travel planning, clinical note generation, or dialogue. The gold standard is user feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down) or behavioral signals (e.g., retention), but these are often scarce in prototypes and research projects, or too-slow to use for system optimization. We present AutoMetrics, a framework for synthesizing evaluation metrics under low-data constraints. AutoMetrics combines retrieval from MetricBank, a collection of 48 metrics we curate, with automatically generated LLM-as-a-Judge criteria informed by lightweight human feedback. These metrics are composed via regression to maximize correlation with human signal. AutoMetrics takes you from expensive measures to interpretable automatic metrics. Across 5 diverse tasks, AutoMetrics improves Kendall correlation with human ratings by up to 33.4% over LLM-as-a-Judge while requiring fewer than 100 feedback points. We show that AutoMetrics can be used as a proxy reward to equal effect as a verifiable reward. We release the full AutoMetrics toolkit and MetricBank to accelerate adaptive evaluation of LLM applications.

*G. M. Refatul Islam,Safwan Shaheer,Yaseen Nur,Mohammad Rafid Hamid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an NLP system for automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation from text input to assist teachers and enable student self-assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While NLP has advanced objective question generation, automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation remain underdeveloped. Such a system could help teachers assess student work and allow students to self-assess their understanding after reading materials.

Method: The research aims to improve existing NLP models or develop novel ones specifically for automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation from text input.

Result: The abstract does not present specific results, as it describes the research aim rather than completed findings.

Conclusion: Automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation systems have significant potential to enhance educational assessment and student learning experiences through NLP technology.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most revolutionary technologies today. It uses artificial intelligence to understand human text and spoken words. It is used for text summarization, grammar checking, sentiment analysis, and advanced chatbots and has many more potential use cases. Furthermore, it has also made its mark on the education sector. Much research and advancements have already been conducted on objective question generation; however, automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation are still in progress. An automated system to generate subjective questions and evaluate the answers can help teachers assess student work and enhance the student's learning experience by allowing them to self-assess their understanding after reading an article or a chapter of a book. This research aims to improve current NLP models or make a novel one for automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation from text input.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid fine-tuning framework combining gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations and unitary constraints, paired with lightweight data governance, achieves efficient multilingual adaptation with improved accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable resource-efficient multilingual adaptation of large language models for low-resource scenarios while maintaining accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets.

Method: Governance-aware hybrid fine-tuning framework combining gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing, introducing unitary constraints in selected sub-layers, and incorporating lightweight data governance steps (language identification, near-duplicate removal, quality filtering).

Result: Consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines on XNLI and FLORES, improved directional balance and probability calibration, resilience to lightweight orthographic variants, additive benefits from governance steps, modest training overhead, and favorable cost-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: Hybrid and unitary PEFT with practical data governance provides a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation, offering improved performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present a governance-aware hybrid fine-tuning framework for multilingual, low-resource adaptation of large language models. The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2. Together, these results show that hybrid and unitary PEFT provide a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation when paired with practical data governance.

*Zeyuan Allen-Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Canon Layers - lightweight architectural components that enhance horizontal information flow across tokens, improving reasoning depth and breadth while making weak architectures competitive with state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural differences in language models are hard to evaluate at academic-scale pretraining due to noise and randomness. The authors aim to create controlled synthetic pretraining tasks to isolate and evaluate core model capabilities.

Method: Introduce Canon Layers - lightweight components that compute weighted sums of nearby token representations to promote horizontal information flow. These layers integrate into various architectures (Transformers, linear attention, state-space models) and are evaluated through synthetic pretraining tasks.

Result: Canon layers enhance reasoning depth by 2x, improve reasoning breadth and knowledge manipulation. They enable weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA models like Mamba2/GDN. Validated through both synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining.

Conclusion: The synthetic playground approach offers an economical, principled way to isolate core model capabilities. With infinite high-quality data, it may predict how future architectures will behave as training pipelines improve, unlocking deeper reasoning and hierarchical inference.

Abstract: Understanding architectural differences in language models is challenging, especially at academic-scale pretraining (e.g., 1.3B parameters, 100B tokens), where results are often dominated by noise and randomness. To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term "canon" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.
  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales. Equipped with infinite high-quality data, it may even PREDICT how future architectures will behave as training pipelines improve -- e.g., through better data curation or RL-based post-training -- unlocking deeper reasoning and hierarchical inference.

*Jiajun Wu,Jian Yang,Wei Zhang,Lin Jing,Yuqing Ma,Ensheng Shi,Yuchi Ma,Zhoujun Li,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IPC is an unsupervised framework that probes LLMs' internal knowledge for code generation without external data, using self-consistency and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for code generation rely heavily on expensive supervised training with labeled/unlabeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain at scale. The paper aims to reduce dependency on external data and computational resources.

Method: IPC uses internal probing of LLMs through problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation. It identifies reliable code candidates via self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder without external corpus.

Result: The unsupervised approach achieves competitive performance compared to supervised methods across multiple code benchmarks while significantly reducing dependency on labeled data and computational resources.

Conclusion: Internal model states contain rich signals about code quality/correctness, and properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

*Zabir Al Nazi,G M Shahariar,Abrar Hossain,Wei Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CulturalToM-VQA, a new benchmark with 5095 questions to evaluate Theory of Mind reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering, addressing limitations of Western-centric benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theory of Mind is fundamental for human social intelligence but remains challenging for AI. Existing Vision-Language Models are applied to social tasks, but their capacity for cross-cultural ToM reasoning is largely unexplored, with current benchmarks being Western-centric.

Method: Created CulturalToM-VQA using a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline: human experts curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM generates structured ToM-focused scene descriptions; these are refined into question-answer pairs spanning six ToM tasks and four complexity levels.

Result: Developed a benchmark containing 5095 questions that capture culturally grounded cues (rituals, attire, gestures, interpersonal dynamics) and covers diverse ToM facets including mental state attribution, false belief reasoning, non-literal communication, social norm violations, perspective coordination, and multi-agent reasoning.

Conclusion: CulturalToM-VQA enables systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks, providing a tool to assess AI's cross-cultural social intelligence capabilities.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to attribute beliefs, desires, and emotions to others -- is fundamental for human social intelligence, yet remains a major challenge for artificial agents. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in socially grounded tasks, but their capacity for cross-cultural ToM reasoning is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels. The resulting dataset covers diverse theory of mind facets such as mental state attribution, false belief reasoning, non-literal communication, social norm violations, perspective coordination, and multi-agent reasoning.

*Menna Elgabry,Ali Hamdi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A confidence-weighted, credibility-aware ensemble framework for emotion detection using diverse small transformer models outperforms larger LLMs with better parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more effective emotion detection system by combining architecturally diverse small LLMs with dual-weighted voting, inspired by Condorcet's Jury Theorem, to outperform larger models while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Method: Combines five diverse transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, ELECTRA) fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. Uses dual-weighted voting with global credibility (validation F1) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to weight model contributions dynamically.

Result: Achieves 93.5% macro F1 score on DAIR-AI dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and outperforming larger LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, Phi) even after LoRA fine-tuning, with only 595M total parameters.

Conclusion: Carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized NLP tasks like emotion detection, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces a confidence-weighted, credibility-aware ensemble framework for text-based emotion detection, inspired by Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT). Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.

### [126] [Linear Personality Probing and Steering in LLMs: A Big Five Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17639)
*Michel Frising,Daniel Balcells*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linear directions in LLM activation space can effectively probe personality traits but have limited steering capabilities, especially in open-ended contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit distinct personalities affecting trust and engagement, but current personality control methods are either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Linear probing/steering offers a cheap, efficient alternative.

Method: Used Llama 3.3 70B to generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters with Big Five trait scores. Prompted model with descriptions and Alpaca questionnaire questions, sampled hidden activations varying along personality traits. Learned per-layer linear directions via linear regression for probing and steering.

Result: Linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection. Steering capabilities strongly depend on context: reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present.

Conclusion: Linear directions can effectively probe LLM personality traits but have context-dependent steering limitations, suggesting they're better for analysis than robust behavioral control in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit distinct and consistent personalities that greatly impact trust and engagement. While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.

*Marco Gaido,Sara Papi,Mauro Cettolo,Matteo Negri,Luisa Bentivogli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces simulstream, an open-source framework for evaluating and demonstrating Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation systems, addressing limitations of the outdated SimulEval repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation tools (SimulEval) are no longer maintained, don't support output revision systems, are designed for short segments rather than long-form audio, and lack demo capabilities, creating a need for a modern unified framework.

Method: Developed simulstream framework that supports both incremental decoding and re-translation methods, designed specifically for long-form speech processing, and includes an interactive web interface for demonstrations.

Result: Created the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems, enabling comparison of different approaches in terms of both quality and latency.

Conclusion: Simulstream addresses critical gaps in StreamST evaluation infrastructure by providing a modern, comprehensive framework that supports diverse system types, long-form processing, and demonstration capabilities.

Abstract: Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation (StreamST) requires producing translations concurrently with incoming speech, imposing strict latency constraints and demanding models that balance partial-information decision-making with high translation quality. Research efforts on the topic have so far relied on the SimulEval repository, which is no longer maintained and does not support systems that revise their outputs. In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems. Designed for long-form speech processing, it supports not only incremental decoding approaches, but also re-translation methods, enabling for their comparison within the same framework both in terms of quality and latency. In addition, it also offers an interactive web interface to demo any system built within the tool.

*Ramaneswaran Selvakumar,Cindy Tseng,Eesung Kim,Vijendra Raj Apsingekar,Yun Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A contextual biasing method for ASR models that uses multi-token prediction to better recognize rare named entities without extra architectural complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models struggle with recognizing rare or unseen named entities (contact names, locations) which are critical for virtual assistant applications.

Method: Proposes contextual biasing for attention-based encoder-decoder models using candidate named entities list. Instead of single token prediction, uses multi-token prediction to "peek into future" and score potential entities. Leverages multi-token prediction logits directly without additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers.

Result: Experiments on Librispeech show up to 50.34% relative improvement in named entity word error rate compared to baseline AED model.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves named entity recognition in ASR systems while maintaining architectural simplicity compared to existing contextual biasing methods.

Abstract: While end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models excel at general transcription, they struggle to recognize rare or unseen named entities (e.g., contact names, locations), which are critical for downstream applications like virtual assistants. In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to "peek into the future" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list. Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity. Experiments on Librispeech demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 50.34% relative improvement in named entity word error rate compared to the baseline AED model.

*Riccardo Di Sipio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification in neural QA systems, comparing Laplace approximations vs MAP estimates for better uncertainty calibration and selective prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and responsible deployment of neural question-answering systems by quantifying uncertainty, allowing models to abstain when confidence is low.

Method: Applied Bayesian inference to neural networks: starting with MLP on Iris dataset, then to language models with frozen head, and finally LoRA-adapted transformers on CommonsenseQA benchmark. Compared Laplace approximations against MAP estimates.

Result: Bayesian methods provide uncertainty calibration and enable selective prediction, allowing models to abstain with "I don't know" responses when confidence is low.

Conclusion: Bayesian reasoning contributes to more responsible and ethical deployment of neural QA systems by improving uncertainty quantification and interpretability through selective prediction.

Abstract: We explore Bayesian reasoning as a means to quantify uncertainty in neural networks for question answering. Starting with a multilayer perceptron on the Iris dataset, we show how posterior inference conveys confidence in predictions. We then extend this to language models, applying Bayesian inference first to a frozen head and finally to LoRA-adapted transformers, evaluated on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art accuracy, we compare Laplace approximations against maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates to highlight uncertainty calibration and selective prediction. This allows models to abstain when confidence is low. An ``I don't know'' response not only improves interpretability but also illustrates how Bayesian methods can contribute to more responsible and ethical deployment of neural question-answering systems.

*Lydia Nishimwe,Benoît Sagot,Rachel Bawden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes challenges in translating user-generated content (UGC) with non-standard language, develops a taxonomy of non-standard phenomena and translation actions, and shows that LLM translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts that align with dataset guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGC translation is challenging due to frequent non-standard language (spelling errors, slang, emojis, etc.), and what constitutes a "good" translation depends on the desired level of standardness in the output.

Method: Examined human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, derived a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Conducted case study on LLMs to test sensitivity to prompts with explicit translation instructions.

Result: Analysis revealed notable differences in how UGC is treated across datasets, creating a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. LLM translation scores were highly sensitive to prompts with explicit UGC translation instructions, improving when prompts aligned with dataset guidelines.

Conclusion: When preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. The paper calls for clear guidelines during dataset creation and development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) is characterised by frequent use of non-standard language, from spelling errors to expressive choices such as slang, character repetitions, and emojis. This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a "good" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.

Motivation: Current computational affective and social science research faces substantial impediments in discovering, accessing, and using language annotation resources, particularly for practitioners outside computer science.

Method: Created the ABCDE dataset - a large-scale collection of over 400 million text utterances drawn from social media, blogs, books, and AI-generated sources, annotated with comprehensive features relevant to computational affective and social science.

Result: Developed a large-scale annotated dataset (400M+ utterances) with diverse text sources and comprehensive feature annotations covering affect, body, cognition, demographics, and emotion dimensions.

Conclusion: ABCDE dataset facilitates interdisciplinary research across affective science, cognitive science, digital humanities, sociology, political science, and computational linguistics by providing accessible, annotated language data.

Abstract: Work in Computational Affective Science and Computational Social Science explores a wide variety of research questions about people, emotions, behavior, and health. Such work often relies on language data that is first labeled with relevant information, such as the use of emotion words or the age of the speaker. Although many resources and algorithms exist to enable this type of labeling, discovering, accessing, and using them remains a substantial impediment, particularly for practitioners outside of computer science. Here, we present the ABCDE dataset (Affect, Body, Cognition, Demographics, and Emotion), a large-scale collection of over 400 million text utterances drawn from social media, blogs, books, and AI-generated sources. The dataset is annotated with a wide range of features relevant to computational affective and social science. ABCDE facilitates interdisciplinary research across numerous fields, including affective science, cognitive science, the digital humanities, sociology, political science, and computational linguistics.

*Zhihan Zhou,Daqian Shi,Rui Song,Lida Shi,Xiaolei Diao,Hao Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AncientBench is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs' comprehension of ancient Chinese excavated documents, covering four dimensions (glyph, pronunciation, meaning, context) through ten tasks, revealing LLMs' potential and gaps compared to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Chinese benchmarks focus on modern Chinese and transmitted ancient documents, but lack evaluation for excavated ancient documents. There's a need to assess LLMs' comprehension of ancient characters to advance archaeology and historical understanding.

Method: Created AncientBench with four dimensions (glyph, pronunciation, meaning, contextual comprehension) and ten tasks (radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, etc.). Involved archaeological researchers for evaluation, proposed an ancient model baseline, and tested top-performing LLMs.

Result: Experimental results show LLMs have great potential in ancient textual scenarios but still have significant gaps compared to human experts. The benchmark provides comprehensive evaluation framework for ancient character comprehension.

Conclusion: AncientBench addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs for excavated ancient documents, promotes development of LLMs in archaeology and ancient Chinese language, and reveals both potential and limitations of current models in this specialized domain.

Abstract: Comprehension of ancient texts plays an important role in archaeology and understanding of Chinese history and civilization. The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans. Our research aims to promote the development and application of large language models in the field of archaeology and ancient Chinese language.

Motivation: While MedER research has advanced significantly for English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored despite their potential to contribute to automated medical systems and enhance patient care. The lack of annotated datasets for these languages presents a major challenge that needs to be addressed.

Method: The study first examined several transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa) for Bangla MedER, then proposed a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach. The authors also developed a high-quality annotated dataset specifically for Bangla MedER to address the data scarcity issue.

Result: The Multi-BERT Ensemble approach achieved the highest accuracy of 89.58%, outperforming all baseline models. This represents an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model. The dataset enabled comprehensive evaluation through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating the model's robustness.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models for improving MedER in Bangla and establish a foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP. The work successfully bridges the gap in MedER research for under-resourced languages.

Abstract: Medical Entity Recognition (MedER) is an essential NLP task for extracting meaningful entities from the medical corpus. Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP.

TL;DR: DEER is a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports generated by LLMs, addressing limitations of existing evaluation methods through expert-grounded rubrics and comprehensive fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, LLM judges often miss issues requiring expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only limited subsets of cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability.

Method: DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks across 13 domains with an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimensions) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. It includes task-specific expert guidance for LLM judges and proposes a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims (both cited and uncited) while quantifying external-evidence quality.

Result: DEER correlates closely with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: DEER provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports generated by LLMs, addressing key limitations in current evaluation methods through expert-grounded assessment and comprehensive fact verification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, deep research systems can generate expert-level reports via multi-step reasoning and evidence-based synthesis, but evaluating such reports remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, evaluations that rely heavily on LLM judges can fail to capture issues that require expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. DEER further provides task-specific expert guidance to help LLM judges assess expert-level report quality more consistently. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality. DEER correlates closely with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShareChat is a large-scale, cross-platform dataset of 142,808 conversations from 5 major LLM platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) preserving native interface elements like reasoning traces and source links across 101 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing public datasets treat LLMs as generic text generators, stripping away the interface context that shapes user interaction. The authors aim to address this limitation by creating a dataset that preserves platform-specific affordances.

Method: Collected 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns from publicly shared URLs across five major LLM platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) from April 2023 to October 2025, preserving native platform elements like reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts.

Result: Created ShareChat dataset spanning 101 languages with substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. Demonstrated utility through three analyses: conversation completeness, source citation behaviors, and temporal analysis of evolving usage patterns.

Conclusion: ShareChat provides a vital resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions by preserving platform-specific interface elements that are typically lost in standard logs, enabling more realistic analysis of real-world LLM usage patterns.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into distinct platforms with unique interface designs and capabilities, existing public datasets treat models as generic text generators, stripping away the interface context that actively shapes user interaction. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale, cross-platform corpus comprising 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns collected from publicly shared URLs across five major platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild.

### [136] [Navigating Taxonomic Expansions of Entity Sets Driven by Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16953)
*Pietro Cofone,Giovanni Amendola,Marco Manna,Aldo Ricioppo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces efficient reasoning tasks for navigating expansion graphs without full materialization, enabling practical entity set expansion with taxonomic structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional linear entity set expansion approaches fail to capture rich taxonomic structures present in knowledge resources. While expansion graphs provide a logical framework for taxonomic expansions, their potentially large size makes full materialization impractical for real-world applications.

Method: The authors formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the expansion graph. They show these tasks can be implemented efficiently under realistic assumptions like bounding input size or limiting entity descriptions.

Result: The proposed reasoning tasks enable local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs without requiring full graph construction. This makes taxonomic entity set expansion practical for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: By formalizing efficient reasoning tasks for expansion graphs, the paper enables practical applications of taxonomic entity set expansion that can navigate knowledge structures incrementally without the computational burden of full graph materialization.

Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in scientific AI, there's no coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI) - the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains. The authors aim to establish a foundation for AI systems that can genuinely participate in scientific discovery.

Method: Operationalize SGI using the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. Create SGI-Bench with over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions. Introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) to optimize retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference.

Result: Results reveal significant gaps: low exact match (10-20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. TTRL enhances hypothesis novelty without reference answers.

Conclusion: The PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that can genuinely participate in scientific discovery, addressing current limitations in scientific AI capabilities.

### [138] [PAACE: A Plan-Aware Automated Agent Context Engineering Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16970)
*Kamer Ali Yuksel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAACE is a framework for optimizing LLM agent contexts through plan-aware compression, improving accuracy while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents in complex workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that need curation to maintain fidelity and reduce costs, but existing compression methods ignore the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning.

Method: PAACE uses next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression, with two components: PAACE-Syn (synthetic workflow generator with compression supervision) and PAACE-FT (distilled plan-aware compressors trained from teacher demonstrations).

Result: On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, it improves accuracy and F1 with fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. PAACE-FT retains 97% of teacher performance while reducing inference cost by over 10x.

Conclusion: PAACE enables practical deployment of plan-aware compression for LLM agents, consistently improving correctness while substantially reducing context load and computational costs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in complex, multi-step workflows involving planning, tool use, reflection, and interaction with external knowledge systems. These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97 percent of the teacher's performance while reducing inference cost by over an order of magnitude, enabling practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models.

*Ali Eslami,Jiangbo Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates security threats in Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), analyzing both OWASP-style AI risks and cross-layer cyber-attacks, proposing a role-based architecture and severity framework for assessing security in AI-driven vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing security frameworks like OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks don't address safety-critical cyber-physical systems like vehicles, nor account for interactions between agentic AI and other vehicle layers (perception, communication, control). There's a need for structured security analysis for agentic AI in vehicles.

Method: Introduces a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles with Personal Agent and Driving Strategy Agent components. Investigates vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks using severity matrix and attack-chain analysis to show how small distortions escalate into unsafe behavior.

Result: Develops a framework for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in vehicles, demonstrating how vulnerabilities in one layer can propagate to others, creating safety-critical threats in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: Provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in current and emerging vehicle platforms, addressing both AI-specific vulnerabilities and cross-layer interactions in safety-critical automotive systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.

*Yinxu Tang,Chengsong Huang,Jiaxin Huang,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces relation-centric KGQA, where answers are subgraphs showing semantic connections between entities, and proposes UniRel-R1 framework with subgraph selection, graph pruning, and RL-fine-tuned LLM to find compact, informative subgraphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KGQA focuses on entity-centric queries with single-entity answers, but real-world queries often seek to understand how entities are associated, requiring relation-centric approaches that return semantic connection subgraphs.

Method: Proposes UniRel-R1 framework with three components: 1) subgraph selection, 2) multi-stage graph pruning, and 3) LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning using reward function that encourages compact, specific subgraphs with informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

Conclusion: The relation-centric KGQA setting and UniRel-R1 framework effectively address the challenge of identifying unique, informative subgraph answers from abundant candidate connections, advancing beyond traditional entity-centric approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has traditionally focused on entity-centric queries that return a single answer entity. However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-driven agent simulations reveal realistic threats directly increase hostility while symbolic threats only increase hostility when mediated by ingroup bias and only in absence of realistic threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how realistic (material) and symbolic threats interact in driving human conflict, overcoming limitations of weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data in real-world studies.

Method: Used simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threats while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Employed representational analyses to examine how LLMs encode different threat types and how steering these states causally shifts behavior.

Result: Realistic threat directly increases hostility, while symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and only increase hostility when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.

Conclusion: LLM-driven simulations provide causal insights into threat-driven conflict dynamics: realistic threats have direct effects on hostility, while symbolic threats operate indirectly through social identity processes, with important moderating factors like intergroup contact and structural asymmetries.

Abstract: Human conflict is often attributed to threats against material conditions and symbolic values, yet it remains unclear how they interact and which dominates. Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.

*Cole Wyeth,Marcus Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper extends AIXI reinforcement learning to handle more utility functions, addressing ambiguity in finite history predictions by exploring death interpretations and imprecise probabilities using Choquet integrals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize AIXI to accommodate broader utility functions while addressing the ambiguity that arises when some hypotheses only predict finite history prefixes, which relates to semimeasure loss and potential death interpretations.

Method: The method involves treating belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, using Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory to compute expected utilities, and analyzing their computability levels.

Result: The standard recursive value function is recovered as a special case, but the most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as Choquet integrals.

Conclusion: The paper successfully generalizes AIXI with broader utility functions, explores death interpretations and imprecise probabilities, but finds limitations in characterizing certain expected utilities as Choquet integrals.

Abstract: We generalize the AIXI reinforcement learning agent to admit a wider class of utility functions. Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals.

*Timo Pierre Schrader,Lukas Lange,Tobias Kaminski,Simon Razniewski,Annemarie Friedrich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for fine-tuning LLMs to generate Answer Set Programming code from natural language problem specifications, addressing the challenge of limited ASP examples in pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs are effective for general-purpose programming languages, they struggle with domain-specific languages like Answer Set Programming (ASP) due to limited examples seen during pre-training. ASP is particularly important for combinatorial search problems, but current LLMs face challenges in generating accurate ASP code.

Method: The authors propose an ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning. They sample ASP statements from LLMs for logic puzzles, categorize them into chosen/rejected instances based on solver feedback (leveraging ASP's declarative property that partial encodings narrow solution space), apply supervised fine-tuning, and further improve robustness using solver-guided search with best-of-N sampling.

Result: Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets, showing that the proposed method effectively enhances LLMs' ability to generate ASP code from natural language specifications.

Conclusion: The ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach successfully addresses the challenge of generating domain-specific ASP code by leveraging solver feedback for instruction-tuning, enabling LLMs to better handle the complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in coding assistants. While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.

TL;DR: SAGE is a novel RL framework that enhances LLM agents' self-improvement through skill libraries, achieving higher task completion with fewer interactions and tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents struggle with continuous improvement and adaptation in new environments, and current skill library approaches relying on LLM prompting have inconsistent implementation challenges.

Method: Proposes SAGE (Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution), an RL framework with Sequential Rollout that deploys agents across task chains, accumulating skills in a library, and uses Skill-integrated Reward to enhance skill generation and utilization.

Result: On AppWorld, SAGE achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion with 26% fewer interaction steps and 59% fewer tokens, outperforming existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively enhances LLM agents' self-improvement capabilities through systematic skill library integration with RL, demonstrating superior performance in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit for uncertainty-aware reasoning, showing advantages over Bayesian Model Averaging on benchmark tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning under uncertainty is challenging in AI, especially for real-world tasks with sparse data requiring systematic generalization. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions.

Method: A Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to Mini-ARC benchmark tasks, it produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even with noisy or partially incorrect hypotheses.

Result: Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. The method produces conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs.

Conclusion: The results highlight the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty, showing advantages over traditional Bayesian approaches.

Motivation: Existing MMRAG methods lack explainability as they fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, limiting transparency and trust in the results.

Method: A two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework: 1) Rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning for coarse-grained point-wise ranking to filter irrelevant documents, and 2) Reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning for joint optimization of fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation with explainable reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA benchmark datasets, with effectiveness validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed reinforcement learning approach successfully enhances reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models, enabling explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) enables highly credible generation by integrating external multi-modal knowledge, thus demonstrating impressive performance in complex multi-modal scenarios. However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA, two benchmark datasets for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, and its effectiveness is validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

*Kai Liu,Leyang Chen,Wenbo Li,Zhikai Chen,Zhixin Wang,Renjing Pei,Linghe Kong,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UmniBench is a comprehensive benchmark for unified multimodal models that evaluates understanding, generation, and editing abilities within a single framework across 13 domains and 200+ concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) are decoupled, assessing understanding and generation abilities separately. There's a need for a holistic benchmark that can evaluate all capabilities together to provide a more comprehensive view of UMM performance.

Method: UmniBench uses human-examined prompts and QA pairs, leveraging UMMs themselves to evaluate generation and editing abilities using their understanding capabilities. This creates a unified evaluation process that can assess all three abilities together or separately for fine-grained analysis.

Result: The benchmark covers 13 major domains and over 200 concepts, providing thorough inspection of UMMs. Researchers benchmarked 24 popular models including both UMMs and single-ability large models using this framework.

Conclusion: UmniBench provides a more comprehensive and objective evaluation framework for unified multimodal models, offering logistical support for improving community models by enabling holistic assessment of understanding, generation, and editing capabilities.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.

*Ziyang Lin,Zixuan Sun,Sanhorn Chen,Xiaoyang Chen,Roy Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Speculation-and-correction framework reduces inference latency in real-time control agents by generating action queues with predicted latent rollouts, then applying lightweight corrections when observations arrive, reducing planning inferences by 44% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time sequential control agents are bottlenecked by inference latency, where even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. The need exists to reduce planning frequency while maintaining control stability.

Method: Adapts speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. Uses a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner to generate short-horizon action queues with predicted latent rollouts. When new observations arrive, measures mismatch between encoded real latent state and queued predicted latent. For small/moderate mismatch, applies lightweight learned corrector (gated two-tower MLP or temporal Transformer) distilled offline from replanning teacher. For large mismatch, falls back to full replanning.

Result: On DMC Humanoid-Walk task: reduces planning inferences from 500 to 282 (44% reduction), improves end-to-end step latency by 25%, maintains strong control performance with only 7.1% return reduction. Ablation shows speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons.

Conclusion: The speculation-and-correction framework effectively reduces inference latency in real-time control while maintaining performance. Mismatch-aware correction is essential for robust latency reduction, as speculative execution alone is unreliable over longer horizons.

Abstract: Real-time sequential control agents are often bottlenecked by inference latency. Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.

*Miru Hong,Minho Lee,Geonhee Jo,Jae-Hee So,Pascal Bauer,Sang-Ki Ko*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EventGPT is a player-conditioned transformer model that predicts next football events and their value, enabling counterfactual simulations to evaluate player transfers by simulating performance in new tactical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transfer evaluation methods rely on static statistics that fail to capture how players adapt to new tactical environments and teammates, making it difficult to predict transfer success.

Method: EventGPT uses a GPT-style autoregressive transformer that treats match play as token sequences, jointly predicting next action type, location, timing, and residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) conditioned on player identity and context.

Result: The model outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision on five seasons of Premier League data, and enables practical transfer analysis through counterfactual simulations.

Conclusion: EventGPT provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit by simulating how players' behavioral distributions and value profiles change in different teams or tactical structures.

Abstract: Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.

TL;DR: LLMs can function as competent Pokémon battle agents without domain-specific training, demonstrating tactical reasoning and content creation capabilities for turn-based strategic games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pokémon battles provide a unique testbed for evaluating LLMs' strategic decision-making abilities, testing reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment that mirror human strategic thinking.

Method: Developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic, capturing essential mechanics like type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management.

Result: Systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency, showing LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games, positioning them as both players and designers with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.

Abstract: Strategic decision-making in Pokémon battles presents a unique testbed for evaluating large language models. Pokémon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pokémon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pokémon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pokémon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.

### [151] [Dialectics for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17373)
*Zhengmian Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithmic-information framework for defining concepts as information objects based on structural relations to experience, with reversibility constraints to prevent concepts from floating free of experience, and formalizes dialectics as optimization dynamics for concept evolution and multi-agent alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether AI can discover concepts from raw experience without human supervision, given that human concepts are fluid and boundaries shift (e.g., Pluto's planetary status). Need a definition of "concept" that's not just a dictionary label but a revisable, comparable, alignable structure across agents.

Method: Proposes algorithmic-information viewpoint: concepts as information objects defined through structural relation to agent's total experience. Core constraint is determination via reversible consistency relations. Defines excess information to measure redundancy overhead. Formulates dialectics as optimization dynamics where competing concepts bid to explain new information via shorter conditional descriptions. Formalizes concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds for reconstruction under shared protocols.

Result: Provides formal framework for concept discovery and evolution: concepts are checkable structural claims based on reversibility; natural decompositions minimize excess information; dialectics drives systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, merging of concepts; enables low-cost concept transmission via compute-bits trade-off.

Conclusion: The algorithmic-information framework offers a rigorous foundation for AI concept discovery from raw experience, addressing fluidity of human concepts through structural definitions with reversibility constraints, enabling systematic concept evolution via dialectical optimization and practical multi-agent alignment through efficient transmission protocols.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence discover, from raw experience and without human supervision, concepts that humans have discovered? One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of "concept" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents "concepts" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.

### [152] [Translating the Rashomon Effect to Sequential Decision-Making Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17470)
*Dennis Gross,Jørn Eirik Betten,Helge Spieker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper translates the Rashomon effect from classification to sequential decision-making, showing multiple policies can have identical behavior while differing internally, and demonstrates benefits for robustness and verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Rashomon effect has been studied in classification but not in sequential decision-making, where agents learn policies through environmental interactions. The authors aim to extend this concept to sequential decision-making and explore its implications.

Method: The authors define the Rashomon effect for sequential decision-making as multiple policies with identical behavior but different internal structures. They use formal verification methods to construct and compare complete probabilistic behavior of policies, addressing the challenge of stochastic transitions in sequential decision-making.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. Ensembles from the Rashomon set show greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.

Conclusion: The Rashomon effect extends to sequential decision-making, offering practical benefits including improved robustness through ensemble methods and computational efficiency gains for verification through permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set.

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the phenomenon where multiple models trained on the same data produce identical predictions while differing in which features they rely on internally. This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-powered diagnostic chatbot using GPT-4o with RAG and explainable AI achieves 90% accuracy and 100% top-3 accuracy, outperforming traditional ML models for more transparent, interactive healthcare diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare systems face inefficiencies in diagnostics, rising costs, limited specialist access, leading to treatment delays and poor outcomes. Current AI diagnostic systems lack interactivity and transparency, making them ineffective in real-world patient-centered environments.

Method: Developed a diagnostic chatbot using GPT-4o LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and explainable AI techniques. The system engages patients in dynamic conversations to extract/normalize symptoms, prioritizes diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning, and uses Chain-of-Thought prompting for transparent reasoning.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates promising potential for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare through LLM-powered diagnostic systems with explainable reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Healthcare systems around the world are grappling with issues like inefficient diagnostics, rising costs, and limited access to specialists. These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.

*Anirban Majumdar,Ritam Raha,Rajarshi Roy,David Parker,Marta Kwiatkowska*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Timed Reward Machines (TRMs) as an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints, enabling more expressive reward specifications for time-sensitive RL applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications where delays and timely actions need to be properly rewarded or penalized.

Method: The authors propose Timed Reward Machines (TRMs) that extend reward machines with timing constraints. They develop model-free RL frameworks (tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics, integrating TRMs via abstractions of timed automata and employing counterfactual-imagining heuristics to improve search.

Result: The algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying timing constraints specified by TRMs on popular RL benchmarks. Comparative studies show performance differences under different TRM semantics, and ablation studies highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining heuristics.

Conclusion: TRMs provide a more expressive framework for reward specification in time-sensitive RL applications, and the proposed algorithms effectively learn policies that satisfy timing constraints while achieving high rewards.

Abstract: Reward specification plays a central role in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding the agent's behavior. To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.

*Robin Schimmelpfennig,Mark Díaz,Vinodkumar Prabhakaran,Aida Davani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Humanlike AI design doesn't universally increase trust/engagement; effects are culturally mediated, challenging one-size-fits-all AI governance approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the causal link between humanlike AI design and effects on engagement/trust in realistic global interactions, addressing gaps in safety frameworks that rely on Western assumptions.

Method: Two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations involving real-time, open-ended interactions with an AI system.

Result: Users focus on interactional cues (conversation flow, perspective understanding) rather than theoretical aspects. Humanlike design increases anthropomorphism but doesn't universally boost behavioral trust/engagement - effects vary culturally (e.g., positive in Brazil, negative in Japan).

Conclusion: Human-AI interaction is nuanced and culturally mediated, challenging inherent risk narratives and demanding culturally-sensitive AI governance beyond one-size-fits-all approaches.

Abstract: Over a billion users across the globe interact with AI systems engineered with increasing sophistication to mimic human traits. This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.

*Junyu Zhang,Yifan Sun,Tianang Leng,Jingyan Shen,Liu Ziyin,Paul Pu Liang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a framework to formalize desired reasoning behaviors in Large Reasoning Models, proposing compute and accuracy laws with measurable properties (monotonicity and compositionality), and shows that better compliance with these laws improves reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong performance, Large Reasoning Models exhibit counterintuitive reasoning behaviors leading to suboptimal capabilities. The authors aim to theoretically formalize desired reasoning behaviors to better understand and improve LRMs.

Method: Proposes Laws of Reasoning (LoRe) framework with compute law (linear scaling with question complexity) and accuracy law. Introduces LoRe-Bench benchmark to measure monotonicity and compositionality properties. Develops finetuning approach to enforce compute-law compositionality.

Result: Most reasoning models show reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. Finetuning to enforce compute-law compositionality yields improved reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks, revealing synergistic effects across properties and laws.

Conclusion: The LoRe framework successfully formalizes reasoning behaviors, and better compliance with compute laws consistently improves reasoning performance, demonstrating the value of theoretical formalization for understanding and enhancing Large Reasoning Models.

Abstract: Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.
