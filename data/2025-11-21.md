### [1] [Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16112)
*Taeho Kang,Jaeyeon Park,Kyungjin Lee,Youngki Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 4D Gaussian Splatting method that improves dynamic scene reconstruction through elliptical error clustering, error correcting splat addition, and grouped 4D Gaussian splatting to resolve ambiguous correspondences and improve temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4DGS methods struggle with accurate dynamic scene reconstruction, failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and having inadequate densification in dynamic regions.

Method: Two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition to pinpoint dynamic areas and initialize fitting splats, (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting to improve consistency between splats and dynamic objects. Classifies rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, applies corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency.

Result: Significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, with 0.39dB PSNR improvement on Technicolor Light Field dataset. Shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses limitations in existing 4DGS approaches for dynamic scenes, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality and temporal consistency through targeted error correction and improved splat-object mapping.

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats.

### [2] [Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162)
*Yuting Lu,Ziliang Wang,Weixin Xu,Wei Zhang,Yongqiang Zhao,Yang Yu,Xiaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LNG-SWR is a plug-in method that improves medical image segmentation robustness by injecting noise during training to learn frequency-bias priors, then using selective wavelet reconstruction to suppress noise-sensitive frequency bands while enhancing structural cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial training methods for robust segmentation suffer from clean-robustness trade-offs and high computational costs, limiting scalability in medical imaging applications.

Method: Layer-wise noise injection during training to learn frequency-bias priors, followed by prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction that suppresses noise-sensitive frequency bands while enhancing directional structures and boundary responses.

Result: On CT and ultrasound datasets, LNG-SWR consistently improves clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces performance drops under strong attacks (PGD-L∞/L2 and SSAH), with additive gains when combined with adversarial training.

Conclusion: LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly approach to robust medical image segmentation that works with both adversarial and standard training regimes, offering improved scalability and maintainability.

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

### [3] [UniFit: Towards Universal Virtual Try-on with MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15831)
*Wei Zhang,Yeying Jin,Xin Li,Yan Zhang,Xiaofeng Cong,Cong Wang,Fengcai Qiao,zhichao Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFit is a universal virtual try-on framework that uses a Multimodal Large Language Model to address semantic gaps between text instructions and reference images, and enables learning from limited data through progressive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTON methods struggle with semantic gaps between text instructions and reference images, and face data scarcity in complex scenarios, limiting their flexibility and performance.

Method: Proposes MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA) that integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and learnable queries with semantic alignment loss, plus a two-stage progressive training strategy with self-synthesis pipeline.

Result: UniFit supports diverse VTON tasks including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, achieving state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: UniFit effectively bridges semantic gaps in VTON through MLLM guidance and progressive training, enabling robust performance across complex tasks with limited data.

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

*Seonghun Oh,Youngjung Uh,Jin-Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetraSDF is an analytic meshing framework for neural SDFs that uses a tetrahedral positional encoder to enable precise mesh extraction matching the zero-level set, overcoming limitations of sampling-based and plain ReLU MLP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for extracting meshes from neural SDFs have limitations: sampling-based approaches introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine methods only work with plain ReLU MLPs without positional encoders.

Method: Uses a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder, where barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure. Includes a fixed analytic input preconditioner to reduce directional bias and stabilize training.

Result: Matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to learned isosurfaces with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

Conclusion: TetraSDF provides a precise analytic meshing framework that overcomes limitations of previous methods, enabling exact mesh extraction from neural SDFs while maintaining reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

### [5] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3 is a family of efficient models that use Progressive Hierarchical Distillation to transfer capabilities from the large SAM3 model to lightweight variants suitable for on-device use, achieving strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original SAM3 model has a unified architecture that is too computationally expensive for on-device deployment, creating a need for more efficient alternatives that maintain similar capabilities.

Method: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) with three stages: Encoder Distillation for image features, Temporal Memory Distillation using Perceiver-based modules for spatiotemporal features, and End-to-End Fine-Tuning on SAM3 PCS data.

Result: Created multiple efficient student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones that enable on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher performance.

Conclusion: The approach successfully achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs, making advanced visual understanding capabilities practical for on-device applications.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [6] [Optimizing 3D Gaussian Splattering for Mobile GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16298)
*Md Musfiqur Rahman Sanim,Zhihao Shu,Bahram Afsharmanesh,AmirAli Mirian,Jiexiong Guan,Wei Niu,Bin Ren,Gagan Agrawal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Texture3dgs is an optimized mobile GPU implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting that introduces a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D texture cache, achieving significant speedups and memory reduction for 3D scene reconstruction on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D scene reconstruction on mobile devices for benefits like data privacy, offline operation, and faster responses, by optimizing the computationally intensive 3D Gaussian Splatting method for mobile GPU constraints.

Method: Developed a novel sorting algorithm optimized for 2D texture cache, improved variable layout design, and other optimizations specifically targeting mobile GPU architecture to accelerate the 3DGS pipeline.

Result: Achieved up to 4.1× speedup for sorting, 1.7× overall speedup for 3D scene reconstruction, and reduced memory usage by up to 1.6× compared to baseline implementations.

Conclusion: Texture3dgs effectively optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for mobile GPUs through specialized sorting algorithms and memory optimizations, demonstrating practical feasibility for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

### [7] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes four novel extensions to model-based 6D object pose estimation to address occlusion challenges: dynamic non-uniform sampling, multi-hypothesis inference, iterative refinement, and occlusion-focused training augmentations, achieving significant accuracy improvements and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 6D pose estimation is crucial for robotics and AR, but existing methods struggle with unseen objects and occlusion. Multi-stage pipelines are prone to error propagation under occlusion, degrading performance.

Method: Four key extensions: (1) dynamic non-uniform dense sampling focusing on visible regions, (2) multi-hypothesis inference with confidence-ranked candidates, (3) iterative refinement for progressive accuracy improvement, and (4) occlusion-focused training augmentations for robustness.

Result: Achieved more than 5% accuracy improvement on ICBIN and over 2% on BOP benchmarks, with approximately 3 times faster inference speed compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses occlusion challenges in 6D pose estimation through targeted sampling, multi-hypothesis reasoning, iterative refinement, and specialized training, demonstrating significant performance gains and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

*Zhaoning Wang,Xinyue Wei,Ruoxi Shi,Xiaoshuai Zhang,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartUV is a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates fewer, part-aligned charts with low distortion for challenging AI-generated meshes, outperforming existing methods in chart count and seam length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UV unwrapping methods struggle with AI-generated meshes that are noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned, often producing fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries that cause artifacts and hinder downstream tasks.

Method: Built on PartField's learning-based part decomposition, PartUV combines semantic part decomposition with geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework, maintaining distortion below user thresholds while minimizing chart count, with parallelization and handling of non-manifold meshes.

Result: Evaluated across four datasets, PartUV outperforms existing tools and neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, has high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Conclusion: PartUV provides an effective solution for UV unwrapping challenging AI-generated meshes by leveraging part-based decomposition and geometric heuristics, offering superior performance in chart optimization while maintaining low distortion.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

### [9] [Automatic Uncertainty-Aware Synthetic Data Bootstrapping for Historical Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15875)
*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of limited annotated training data for historical map analysis by proposing methods to generate synthetic historical maps that maintain realism and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical document analysis faces data scarcity issues, especially for homogeneous map corpora where manual annotation is time-consuming and synthetic data often lacks realism and variation.

Method: Proposes automatic deep generative approach and manual stochastic degradation technique to transfer cartographic style from original maps onto vector data, creating synthetic training data that emulates visual uncertainty and noise in historical map scans.

Result: Generated training datasets were successfully used for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on homogeneous map corpus using Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network.

Conclusion: The data bootstrapping methods effectively address the training data scarcity problem in historical map analysis, enabling comprehensive assessment and improving domain-adaptive semantic segmentation performance.

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [10] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D is a category-level 6D pose estimation method for warehouse boxes that uses binary search for dimension inference and a category CAD template for pose estimation, achieving competitive accuracy with 76% faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing 6D pose estimation methods - model-based methods requiring exact CAD models, model-free methods failing under challenging conditions, and category-level approaches being overly general - specifically for storage boxes in warehouse automation contexts.

Method: Uses binary search to infer box dimensions from single RGB-D observation, employs category CAD template instead of instance-specific models, and implements depth-based plausibility filter with early-stopping strategy to reject implausible hypotheses.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior 6D pose precision compared to existing methods while reducing inference time by approximately 76% in real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Box6D provides an efficient and accurate category-level solution for 6D pose estimation of storage boxes in warehouse environments, balancing flexibility and performance while being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

### [11] [RB-FT: Rationale-Bootstrapped Fine-Tuning for Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15923)
*Meilong Xu,Di Fu,Jiaxing Zhang,Gong Yu,Jiayu Zheng,Xiaoling Hu,Dongdi Zhao,Feiyang Li,Chao Chen,Yong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage self-improvement method that uses VLM-generated rationales for fine-tuning, significantly improving domain-specific video classification without new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with domain-specific video classification due to rationale gap - insufficient domain data to bridge semantic distance between complex video content and abstract labels.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Generate detailed textual rationales for videos using VLMs, then fine-tune on these self-generated rationales; 2) Perform conventional supervised fine-tuning on task labels after domain reasoning is acquired.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms direct supervised fine-tuning across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Self-generated rationales provide an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis, bridging the rationale gap without requiring new annotations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGLL is a contrastive learning framework that improves multi-label and cross-granularity alignment in vision-language models, addressing limitations of CLIP in complex domains like medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits effectiveness in domains like medical imaging where images have multiple high-level labels across different annotation granularities.

Method: Proposes MGLL framework with structured multi-label supervision, integration of textual descriptions across granularities, soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints, and smooth KL divergence for cross-granularity consistency.

Result: MGLL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks when pretrained on large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: MGLL effectively addresses multi-label and cross-granularity alignment challenges in vision-language models, particularly benefiting complex domains like medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

*Milos Vukadinovic,Hirotaka Ieki,Yuki Sahasi,David Ouyang,Bryan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated method to extract standard 2D echocardiography views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes using deep learning and anatomical heuristics, validated by cardiologists with 96% accuracy and shown to preserve diagnostic features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between 3D echocardiography's benefits (speed, usability, off-axis assessment) and clinicians' familiarity with conventional 2D video interpretation by automatically generating standard 2D views from 3D volumes.

Method: Combined deep learning view classifier with downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks and cardiologist-provided rules to reconstruct standard echocardiography views from 3D ultrasound volumes.

Result: Validated by three cardiologists with 96% accuracy on 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals; extracted 2D videos preserved spatial calibration and diagnostic features, enabling accurate cardiac abnormality detection and clinical-grade measurements.

Conclusion: The automated approach successfully allows clinicians to interpret 3D echocardiography data in their familiar 2D format while maintaining diagnostic accuracy, bridging the gap between advanced 3D imaging and clinical workflow needs.

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

### [14] [Click2Graph: Interactive Panoptic Video Scene Graphs from a Single Click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15948)
*Raphael Ruschel,Hardikkumar Prajapati,Awsafur Rahman,B. S. Manjunath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph is the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation that combines visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding, enabling users to generate video scene graphs from simple cues like clicks or bounding boxes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VSGG systems operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines without human guidance, while promptable segmentation models lack semantic or relational reasoning. There's a need to unify precise user interaction with comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: The framework uses a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module to generate subject-conditioned object prompts and a Semantic Classification Head for joint entity and predicate reasoning. It segments and tracks subjects across time, discovers interacting objects, and predicts triplets from single user cues.

Result: Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark show that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, demonstrating how human prompting can be effectively combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference.

Conclusion: Click2Graph enables controllable and interpretable video scene understanding by unifying visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning, bridging the gap between interactive segmentation and comprehensive scene graph generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

*Muyao Yuan,Yuanhong Zhang,Weizhan Zhang,Lan Ma,Yuan Gao,Jiangyong Ying,Yudeng Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoCLIP is a method that uses information theory to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, preventing overfitting and preserving vision-language alignment through mutual information objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment, creating a need for more stable modality alignment during fine-tuning.

Method: InfoCLIP leverages an information-theoretic perspective with two mutual information objectives: compressing pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise, and maximizing mutual information between alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and fine-tuned model to transfer local semantic relations.

Result: Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoCLIP demonstrates adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by stabilizing modality alignment during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Conclusion: FADS offers an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning, highlighting the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

*Nimeshika Udayangani,Hadi M. Dolatabadi,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a graph-based approach using GCNs to improve OOD detection in long-tailed vision datasets by exploiting inter-sample relationships and addressing tail-class performance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods perform poorly on long-tailed datasets, showing high false positive rates and low accuracy for tail classes, which limits safe deployment of DNNs in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses pre-trained model features to initialize graph structure, applies Gaussianization to normalize activation layers, and refines the graph using GCNs to create a feature space optimized for long-tailed OOD detection.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT show significant improvements in FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Graph-based representation with GCNs effectively addresses the challenges of OOD detection in long-tailed datasets, substantially outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

TL;DR: A sequence-level optimization framework generates printable adversarial textures for clothing that maintain concealment across entire walking videos, addressing the challenge of wearable attacks in dynamic scenarios with motion and deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for human detection are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially in surveillance environments. Existing wearable attack methods fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation.

Method: The approach maps product images to UV space and converts them into a compact palette with control-point parameterization using ICC locking for printable colors. It employs a physically based human-garment pipeline to simulate motion, multi-angle viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting optimizes control points to minimize detection confidence across sequences.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under both indoor and outdoor recordings.

Conclusion: The sequence-level optimization framework successfully generates natural, printable adversarial textures that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings, confirming real-world feasibility for wearable adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution, integrating sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) concepts into Real-ISR by treating each rank in LoRA as an independent expert, with degradation-aware routing and load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense Real-ISR models using LoRA fine-tuning struggle to adaptively capture heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples and enable efficient knowledge sharing under equivalent computational budgets.

Method: Introduces MoR architecture with fine-grained expert partitioning (each LoRA rank as independent expert), degradation estimation module using CLIP embeddings and text pairs, zero-expert slots, and degradation-aware load-balancing loss for dynamic expert activation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments validate the framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance in single-step image super-resolution.

Conclusion: The proposed MoR architecture successfully addresses limitations of dense Real-ISR models by enabling flexible knowledge recombination, adaptive expert activation based on degradation severity, and optimal computational resource allocation.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing, overcoming limitations of previous methods when laser color changes.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

TL;DR: CuriGS is a curriculum-guided framework that improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for sparse-view reconstruction by generating pseudo-views (student views) around ground-truth poses and progressively training with increasing perturbation levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting to sparse-view settings is challenging due to supervision scarcity and overfitting from limited viewpoint coverage, which CuriGS aims to address.

Method: Generate student views (pseudo-views) around ground-truth teacher poses with different perturbation levels, use curriculum training that gradually increases perturbation, apply depth-correlation and co-regularization, and retain best-performing students based on multi-signal metrics.

Result: CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Conclusion: The curriculum-guided framework with student views effectively addresses sparse-view challenges in 3DGS, achieving superior performance in sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

TL;DR: A cross-modal learning approach that enhances high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV-level detail for crop canopy trait estimation, improving performance on agricultural prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite missions have spatial resolution limitations that hinder effectiveness for micro-plot management in modern farming, while UAVs provide high-resolution data but have different operational constraints.

Method: Train a model using co-registered satellite-UAV image pairs from 84 maize varieties across 5 US locations to learn fine-grained spectral-spatial correspondences between sensing modalities.

Result: Generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on downstream tasks including yield and nitrogen prediction.

Conclusion: Cross-modal correspondence learning can effectively bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing for agricultural monitoring applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using large language models (LLMs) to address challenges in food recognition including domain shift, long-tailed distribution, and fine-grained classification by parsing food images to generate text descriptions and aligning multimodal features in a shared embedding space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition faces challenges due to domain shift between training data (from Internet) and real-world user photos, long-tailed data distribution, and subtle visual differences between similar food categories.

Method: Leverage LLMs to parse food images and generate food titles and ingredients, then project both generated texts and images to a shared embedding space to maximize pair similarities, and use aligned multimodal features for recognition.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification on two food datasets.

Conclusion: The simple LLM-powered framework effectively addresses multiple challenges in food recognition through multimodal alignment and demonstrates superior performance compared to specialized existing approaches.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMS-KV is a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for visual autoregressive models that reduces KV cache usage by 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48% while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching in next-scale prediction VAR models faces excessive memory growth with increasing scales, severely limiting scalability. Current KV caching designs for next-scale based VAR transformers remain largely unexplored.

Method: AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserves most relevant tokens, and optimizes KV cache utilization by identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis.

Result: Reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83%, self-attention latency by 60.48%, and enables stable scaling to batch size 256 where baseline fails at batch size 128 with improved throughput.

Conclusion: AMS-KV effectively addresses KV memory bottlenecks in VAR models through scale-adaptive caching, significantly improving computational efficiency and scalability while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving that require high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data synthesis, which is challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, temporal sparsity of point clouds, and complex dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: LiSTAR provides a powerful foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations through its novel approach to 4D LiDAR data synthesis.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VideoSeg-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex video reasoning and segmentation tasks. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/euyis1019/VideoSeg-R1.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

*Shao-Jun Xia,Huixin Zhang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2T-VICL enables cross-task visual in-context learning for vision-language models by generating optimal text prompts that describe differences between distinct vision tasks and using a novel inference framework with perceptual scoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether vision-language models can perform visual in-context learning when the visual prompts and target images come from different visual tasks, unlocking cross-task capabilities.

Method: Proposes T2T-VICL pipeline with text prompt generation/selection mechanism to describe task differences, constructs first cross-task VICL dataset, and uses perceptual score-based reasoning combined with traditional metrics.

Result: Achieves top-tier results in 9 cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in 10 additional scenarios, demonstrating successful cross-task VICL capabilities.

Conclusion: The approach successfully unlocks cross-task visual in-context learning boundaries in vision-language models through effective prompt engineering and novel inference methods.

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

TL;DR: DCS-LDM is a novel latent diffusion model that decouples content complexity from scale, enabling flexible generation across different resolutions and frame rates with fixed latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent diffusion models couple scale with content complexity, using more tokens for higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, latent capacity should primarily depend on content complexity, with scale only as an upper bound.

Method: DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space using multi-level tokens to model sample complexity. It supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within fixed latent representations, enabling progressive coarse-to-fine generation.

Conclusion: DCS-LDM successfully decouples information complexity from scale, achieving flexible computation-quality tradeoffs and supporting progressive generation across various resolutions and frame rates.

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

### [33] [VTinker: Guided Flow Upsampling and Texture Mapping for High-Resolution Video Frame Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16124)
*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker is a novel Video Frame Interpolation pipeline that addresses blur and ghosting issues in high-resolution frame interpolation through guided flow upsampling and texture mapping techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VFI methods suffer from blur/mosaic artifacts at flow edges and ghosting/discontinuities in interpolated frames due to inaccurate motion estimation at low resolution and pixel-level warping.

Method: Proposes two core components: Guided Flow Upsampling (GFU) that uses input frames as guidance to refine upsampled flows, and Texture Mapping that creates an intermediate proxy frame for selecting clear texture blocks from input frames.

Result: Extensive experiments show VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in Video Frame Interpolation, effectively reducing blurring and ghosting artifacts.

Conclusion: VTinker provides an effective solution for high-quality video frame interpolation by addressing key limitations of existing flow-based methods through guided flow refinement and texture-aware reconstruction.

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiN-CLIP is a novel AI-generated image detection method that uses positive-incentive noise to suppress spurious shortcuts and amplify stable forensic cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 5.4% average accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods struggle with out-of-distribution generalization due to reliance on spurious shortcuts during training, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes PiN-CLIP that jointly trains a noise generator and detection network using variational positive-incentive principle. Constructs positive-incentive noise via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical features, then injects it into feature space to fine-tune visual encoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world dataset with 42 generative models, showing 5.4% average accuracy improvement over existing approaches.

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP effectively addresses shortcut dominance in AI-generated image detection by learning noise-invariant representations, enabling more robust and generalized artifact detection across diverse generative models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

TL;DR: MLLMs lack human-like social reasoning to detect deception. A new MIDA task and dataset reveal models struggle with truth/falsehood distinction. Proposed SoCoT and DSEM methods show promising improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate significant limitations in social intelligence, particularly in assessing deception and 'reading the room' during complex social interactions, which is a core human capability.

Method: Introduced Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA) task with synchronized video-text dataset. Evaluated 12 MLLMs, then designed Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module to improve performance.

Result: Benchmark revealed significant performance gap - even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to reliably distinguish truth from falsehood. Models fail to ground language in multimodal social cues and lack ability to model others' knowledge, beliefs, or intentions.

Conclusion: The proposed SoCoT and DSEM framework shows promising performance improvements, demonstrating a viable path toward building MLLMs with genuine human-like social reasoning capabilities for deception assessment.

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

*Li Yu,Yingbo Zhao,Shiyu Wu,Siyue Yu,Moncef Gabbouj,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a blind video quality enhancement method with pretrained degradation representation learning and hierarchical termination mechanism to handle unknown quantization parameters and varying computational demands across compression levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QECV methods rely on known QPs and use uniform architectures, limiting real-world applicability where QPs may be unknown and ignoring varying computational needs across compression levels.

Method: Uses pretrained Degradation Representation Learning module to extract multiscale degradation representations, and hierarchical termination mechanism to dynamically adjust artifact reduction stages based on compression level.

Result: Achieves 110% PSNR improvement (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over state-of-the-art blind method at QP=22, and reduces average inference time by half at QP=22 compared to QP=42.

Conclusion: The proposed blind QECV approach with degradation representation learning and adaptive computation significantly outperforms existing methods while being more efficient.

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a gap between how 3D object detectors are trained and evaluated, stemming from lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with ranking-based prediction selection used during inference.

Method: Proposes two components: 1) Spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and 2) Rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via self-distillation.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show SR3D significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap in 3D object detection and achieves superior performance on indoor point cloud datasets.

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

*Quanqing Ma,Jiaen Chen,Peng Wang,Yao Zheng,Qingzhan Zhao,Yuchen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new high-resolution dataset HSRW-CD for water body change detection and proposes a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module to better exploit spatial semantic and structural information in change detection networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current limitations include scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for water body change detection and insufficient exploitation of spatial semantic and structural information in existing deep learning methods.

Method: Proposed a three-component SSCP attention module: Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA) for spatial semantics, Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA) for spatial structure, and Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA) for channel similarity using priors from MSA and SRGA.

Result: Experiments on HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of SSCP, significantly improving water body discrimination capability.

Conclusion: The SSCP module effectively enhances water body change detection by leveraging spatial semantics and continuity, and can be integrated as a plug-and-play module into existing models.

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems lack semantic understanding for robotic interaction, and integrating language features faces challenges with excessive memory demands and lack of adaptability to novel environments.

Method: Uses a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder to distill high-dimensional language embeddings into compact 16D features, enabling language-guided pruning and language-based loop detection without separate models.

Result: Achieves real-time performance at 15 FPS, reduces Gaussian count by over 60% while maintaining rendering quality, and provides competitive mapping and tracking accuracy with open-vocabulary capabilities.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM successfully integrates language understanding into 3DGS-based SLAM in real-time, addressing memory and adaptability limitations while enabling advanced semantic interaction capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Motivation: To tackle challenges in long video understanding requiring both efficient architecture and effective handling of extended temporal contexts, while addressing the discovered vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon causing vision token redundancy.

Method: Uses hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone combining efficiency of state-space models with expressivity of attention mechanisms, plus TransV module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens to reduce redundancy.

Result: TimeViper can process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames and competes with state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks while extending frame processing capabilities.

Conclusion: The work represents an initial step toward developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures for long video understanding, with insights into attention behaviors and vision token compression.

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: RGE (Reasoning Guided Embeddings) enhances multimodal embeddings by incorporating explicit reasoning from MLLMs, improving multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over non-reasoning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat embedding extraction as direct encoding, overlooking MLLMs' generative reasoning capability that could enhance representation quality.

Method: Proposes RGE which preserves MLLMs' generative rationale process and couples it with contrastive training, enabling structured rationale generation conditioned on instructions before extracting representations.

Result: Experiments on MMEB benchmark show 4.9% improvement in multimodal retrieval performance over non-reasoning baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality in multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

*Jian Ma,Qirong Peng,Xujie Zhu,Peixing Xie,Chen Chen,Haonan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPCL is a flexible structured pruning framework for Diffusion Transformers that achieves 50% parameter reduction with minimal performance degradation through plug-and-play distillation and redundant layer identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have excellent image generation performance but high computational costs due to large parameter counts, limiting deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Uses linear probing with first-order differential trend analysis to identify redundant layer intervals, then implements plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation for depth-wise and width-wise pruning in a single training phase.

Result: Achieves 50% reduction in parameter count compared to full model with less than 3% degradation in key objective metrics, maintaining high-quality image generation while achieving higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: PPCL provides an effective solution for deploying DiT models in resource-constrained environments through flexible structured pruning with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TwiG is the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout visual generation, allowing reasoning to guide upcoming regions and reflect on synthesized ones for more context-aware outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual generation methods incorporate reasoning either before or after generation, but lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during generation itself.

Method: Three strategies: zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning on TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning via customized TwiG-GRPO strategy.

Result: The framework produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs through dynamic interplay between reasoning and generation.

Conclusion: This work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

*Yibin Huang,Wang Xu,Wanyue Zhang,Helu Zhi,Jingjing Huang,Yangbin Xu,Yangang Sun,Conghui Zhu,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video2Layout is a framework that reconstructs metric-grounded spatial layouts from videos using continuous object boundary coordinates instead of discretized grid maps, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning and quantitative spatial computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grid-based map methods for spatial understanding in MLLMs rely on discretized raster representations, which limit fine-grained spatial reasoning capabilities. The authors aim to overcome this limitation by using continuous coordinates for more precise spatial understanding.

Method: The framework has two stages: 1) Supervised fine-tuning using a dataset from AI2THOR simulator to learn mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates, and 2) Reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance real-world generalization. It also introduces QVS-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Result: The V2LO-7B model achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over models trained on grid maps when evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, validating the superiority of the continuous coordinate approach.

Conclusion: Using continuous object boundary coordinates instead of discretized grid maps significantly improves spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, enabling quantitative spatial computation and reducing ambiguity in spatial relationship descriptions.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ybrrraway/Video2Layout.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simba is a novel point cloud completion framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as distribution learning using diffusion models and symmetry priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance while addressing overfitting and noise sensitivity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of regression-based point cloud completion methods that suffer from overfitting (memorizing instance-specific transformations) and high sensitivity to input noise, which degrade robustness and generalization.

Method: Reformulates point-wise transformation regression as distribution learning, integrates symmetry priors with diffusion models' generative capabilities, and uses hierarchical Mamba-based architecture for high-fidelity upsampling.

Result: Extensive experiments on PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating improved preservation of fine-grained details and global structural integrity.

Conclusion: Simba successfully addresses key limitations of previous methods by combining distribution learning with symmetry priors and diffusion models, achieving robust and generalizable point cloud completion with superior detail preservation.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Zhi Luo,Zenghui Yuan,Wenqi Wei,Daizong Liu,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes VTIA, a verbose-text induction attack that injects imperceptible adversarial perturbations into images to make Vision-Language Models generate excessively long outputs, increasing token consumption and deployment costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about VLMs' deployment efficiency, particularly the high token consumption during generation. Existing methods lack stability and controllability in maximizing output length as an explicit optimization objective.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adversarial prompt search using reinforcement learning to find prompts that induce verbose outputs from LLM components, 2) Vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial images that maximize similarity with adversarial prompt embeddings.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs show the method achieves significant advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VTIA successfully demonstrates how imperceptible adversarial perturbations can be used to systematically induce verbose text generation in VLMs, highlighting security vulnerabilities in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoVLA is a self-supervised Vision-Language-Action framework that addresses stage hallucination in long-horizon robotic manipulation through three key components: Stage-Aligned Reward, Pose-Based Object Exploration, and Long-Horizon Memory, achieving significant improvements in task success and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks without truly completing them, limiting their effectiveness in long-horizon robotic manipulation.

Method: Three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR) using triplet contrastive learning with hard negatives, Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE) grounding curiosity in relative object-gripper pose, and Long-Horizon Memory with selective context retention and gated fusion.

Result: EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over OpenVLA-OFT (69.2%), achieves 1.5x better sample efficiency, reduces stage hallucination from 38.5% to 14.8%, and real-world deployment reaches 54.6% success rate (11 points better than OpenVLA-OFT).

Conclusion: EvoVLA effectively addresses stage hallucination in long-horizon robotic manipulation, demonstrating strong sim-to-real transfer and generalization capabilities through its self-supervised framework.

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-CLIP is a training-free method that addresses CLIP's attention distraction problem by filtering dimension-specific over-activated tokens, improving pixel-level multimodal alignment for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVSS methods leverage CLIP's vision-language alignment but don't explore CLIP's performance boundaries for dense prediction from interpretability perspectives. The key issue identified is CLIP's tendency to divert attention from target regions to irrelevant tokens, similar to human distraction.

Method: Proposed ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP) that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior by filtering dimension-specific over-activated distraction tokens and redirecting attention back to target regions, without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: The method successfully refines CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity by addressing attention distraction issues, demonstrating that training-free approaches can significantly improve dense prediction capabilities in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mantis introduces a Disentangled Visual Foresight framework that separates visual prediction from the main model using meta queries and diffusion Transformer, achieving state-of-the-art performance on robotics tasks while maintaining strong language comprehension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language-Action models face issues with high-dimensional visual state prediction distributing model capacity and incurring training costs, while compressed visual signals create information bottlenecks and neglect language supervision, leading to poor comprehension and reasoning.

Method: Mantis uses a Disentangled Visual Foresight approach that decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone using meta queries and a diffusion Transformer head with residual connections, enabling automatic capture of latent actions that boost explicit action learning.

Result: Mantis achieves 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing baselines with high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show superior performance over π₀.₅ in instruction-following, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The disentangled approach reduces VLA backbone burden, enabling maintenance of comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision while achieving state-of-the-art performance in robotics manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications due to discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, requiring a solution that transfers knowledge without compromising accuracy or requiring new annotations.

Method: Two-stage model: 1) Pre-training with Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate inter-domain modality discrepancies, 2) Fine-tuning with Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) for cross-modality alignment between visible and infrared data using cluster-to-holistic approach.

Result: The method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed DSLGA framework effectively addresses the challenges of unsupervised domain adaptation in VI-ReID by handling both inter-domain and intra-domain modality discrepancies, providing a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Conclusion: PrIntMesh provides a data-efficient, topology-preserving solution suitable for clinical use that reconstructs organs as unified systems rather than independent parts.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions.

Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite impressive progress in embodied VLAs, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions, with existing studies overlooking cross-modal misalignment that affects embodied reasoning.

Method: VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: textual perturbations (gradient-based and prompt-based), visual perturbations (patch and noise distortions), and cross-modal misalignment attacks. It also incorporates a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts for automated semantic guidance.

Result: Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model show that even minor multimodal perturbations cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Conclusion: The study reveals critical vulnerabilities in embodied VLA models and highlights the importance of addressing multimodal adversarial robustness for reliable deployment in real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: ICCE introduces adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling to improve unsupervised image clustering, achieving state-of-the-art performance including 70.4% accuracy on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap in unsupervised image classification by building upon multi-head clustering approaches and developing better consensus methods for diverse clustering results.

Method: Train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone to produce diverse clusterings, then use cluster ensembling to create unified consensus clustering, and finally train an image classifier using the consensus as pseudo-labels.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance: 99.3% on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet - the first unsupervised method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: ICCE demonstrates that combining multi-head clustering with effective ensembling strategies can significantly narrow the performance gap between unsupervised and supervised image classification methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

TL;DR: SwiTrack is a novel cross-modal object tracking framework that uses three specialized streams for RGB, NIR, and invalid modalities, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.2% precision and 4.3% success rate gains while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-modal object tracking methods connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address object drift issues with unreliable inputs.

Method: Proposes a state-switching framework with three specialized streams: RGB frames processed by visual encoder, NIR frames refined via NIR gated adapter with visual encoder, and for invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module using spatio-temporal cues. Also includes dynamic template reconstruction and similarity alignment loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on latest benchmarks with 7.2% precision rate gain and 4.3% success rate gain, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Conclusion: SwiTrack effectively addresses cross-modal object tracking challenges by deploying specialized streams for different modalities, providing robust tracking and mitigating object drift through progressive calibration and trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

TL;DR: A novel MLP-based method with Memory-Block for full-body tracking from sparse sensor inputs, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and 72 FPS on mobile HMDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AR/VR systems only track head and hands via HMDs and controllers, making full-body reconstruction incomplete. There's a need to generate realistic full-body motions from limited sensor data.

Method: Uses multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone enhanced with residual connections and a novel Memory-Block component. Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors combined with previous time instances for temporal consistency. Formulated as multi-task learning problem.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs, improving accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the incomplete full-body tracking problem in AR/VR systems by generating realistic motions from sparse inputs with improved accuracy and real-time performance.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Upsample Anything is a test-time optimization framework that upsamples low-resolution features from Vision Foundation Models to high-resolution pixel outputs without training, using anisotropic Gaussian kernels learned per image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Foundation Models like ViT produce downsampled representations (14x/16x) that limit direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing upsampling methods require dataset-specific retraining or heavy optimization, reducing scalability and generalization.

Method: Per-image optimization learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal edge-aware operator transferable across architectures and modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and upsampling tasks. Runs in ≈0.419s per 224x224 image, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps.

Conclusion: Upsample Anything provides an efficient, training-free solution for feature upsampling that generalizes well across different architectures and modalities while maintaining high performance and speed.

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEs are reframed as topic models, leading to SAE-TM framework that learns reusable topic atoms, interprets them as word distributions, and merges them into topics without retraining, achieving better coherence than baselines across text and image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the role and practical value of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in analyzing embeddings by demonstrating they can be naturally understood as topic models, providing a new perspective on their functionality.

Method: Extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces, derive SAE objective as maximum a posteriori estimator, and introduce SAE-TM framework that trains SAEs to learn reusable topic atoms, interprets them as word distributions, and merges them into topics without retraining.

Result: SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on both text and image datasets while maintaining diversity, and enables analysis of thematic structure in image datasets and tracking topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints.

Conclusion: SAEs are positioned as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities, with the proposed framework providing a practical approach to topic modeling that outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: NaTex is a native 3D texture generation framework that directly predicts texture color in 3D space, avoiding limitations of multi-view diffusion approaches by treating texture as a dense color point cloud.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inherent limitations of MVD pipelines including difficulties with occluded regions requiring inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment, and maintaining cross-view consistency in content and color intensity.

Method: Proposes latent color diffusion with geometry-aware color point cloud VAE and multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT) trained from scratch using 3D data. Uses native geometry control via positional embeddings and geometry latents for precise alignment, with co-designed VAE-DiT architecture.

Result: NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Shows strong generalization capabilities for downstream applications like material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation.

Conclusion: NaTex presents a novel paradigm for native 3D texture generation that effectively addresses limitations of existing multi-view approaches through direct 3D space prediction and geometry-aware architecture design.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hybrid UIE approaches achieve strong performance but incur high computational costs, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios on resource-limited platforms.

Method: Proposes WWE-UIE with three interpretable priors: adaptive white balance for color correction, wavelet-based enhancement block for multi-band decomposition capturing global structures and fine textures, and gradient-aware module using Sobel operators with learnable gating to preserve edge structures.

Result: Extensive experiments show WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

Conclusion: WWE-UIE provides an efficient solution for underwater image enhancement that balances performance with computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChangeDINO is a Siamese framework for building change detection that combines lightweight backbones with frozen DINOv3 features, uses spatial-spectral transformers for change detection, and includes learnable morphology for boundary refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing change detection rely too heavily on change-map annotations and underuse semantic information from non-changing regions, limiting robustness to illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels.

Method: End-to-end multiscale Siamese framework with lightweight backbone stream fused with frozen DINOv3 features, spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder using multi-scale absolute differences as change priors, and learnable morphology module for boundary refinement.

Result: Outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on four public benchmarks in IoU and F1 metrics, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: ChangeDINO provides an effective solution for optical building change detection that leverages semantic-rich features and robust change detection mechanisms, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Motivation: Existing face super-resolution methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations, which restricts their practical applications in real-world scenarios with diverse resolution requirements.

Method: ARASFSR uses 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel. It incorporates a local frequency estimation module to capture high-frequency facial textures and a global coordinate modulation module to leverage facial structure knowledge for resolution adaptation.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate ARASFSR's robustness over state-of-the-art methods, successfully super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Conclusion: ARASFSR provides an effective solution for arbitrary-resolution and arbitrary-scale face super-resolution, overcoming key limitations of existing methods and enabling more flexible and practical applications.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a teacher-student framework with key frame selection for weakly supervised terrain classification in UAV remote sensing, achieving improved mIoU and temporal consistency using only 30% labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UAV terrain classification including data annotation complexity, temporal consistency requirements, data scarcity, and technology range limitations in aerial positioning tasks.

Method: Teacher-student architecture with key frame selection and updating algorithms for weakly supervised learning and temporal consistency knowledge distillation.

Result: Method using only 30% labeled data simultaneously improves mIoU and temporal consistency, enabling stable terrain object localization in aerial tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes traditional temporal consistency training deficiencies in aerial tasks through weakly supervised learning and knowledge distillation.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOMNet is an alignment-free guided depth super-resolution framework that handles misaligned RGB-D data through multi-order matching and aggregation, achieving robust performance without requiring spatial alignment between depth and RGB sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RGB-D acquisition suffers from hardware limitations and calibration drift, causing spatial misalignment that degrades performance of existing guided depth super-resolution methods which assume strict alignment.

Method: Proposes Multi-Order Matching Network with: 1) multi-order matching mechanism (zero-order, first-order, second-order) to identify relevant RGB information across feature spaces, and 2) multi-order aggregation with structure detectors using priors as prompts for selective feature transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments show MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness in handling misaligned RGB-D data.

Conclusion: MOMNet provides an effective alignment-free solution for guided depth super-resolution that overcomes real-world misalignment challenges through comprehensive multi-order feature matching and selective aggregation.

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits outstanding robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous offline signature verification methods rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, which may not capture fine-grained differences needed for robust verification. Transformer-based backbones can naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting performance.

Method: The proposed DetailSemNet model emphasizes local structure matching between signature images. It introduces a Detail Semantics Integrator that uses feature disentanglement and re-entanglement to enhance intricate details while expanding discriminative semantics, improving local structural matching effectiveness.

Result: The model consistently outperforms recent methods on leading benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. It also demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Conclusion: DetailSemNet's focus on local structure matching not only improves verification accuracy but also enhances model interpretability and generalizability, making it highly suitable for real-world applications in offline signature verification.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CAMS effectively improves generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions by extracting semantic features and performing semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

*Samer Abualhanud,Christian Grannemann,Max Mehltretter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-guided self-supervised method for consistent surround-view depth estimation using multi-camera rigs that projects 3D points onto a shared cylinder and applies spatial attention across images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised surround-view depth estimation methods suffer from inconsistent depth estimates between overlapping images, limiting their practical utility for 360° 3D perception.

Method: Predict initial depth maps per image, project 3D points onto a shared unit cylinder to establish cross-image neighborhood relations, create position maps, and apply explicit spatial attention to aggregate features across images based on cylinder distances.

Result: The approach improves depth consistency across images and overall depth quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on DDAD and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-guided method with explicit spatial attention enables dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth estimation for multi-camera systems.

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Graph-based segmentation methods combining Vision Transformers with Graph Neural Networks improve surgical scene analysis by better modeling spatial relationships and handling occlusions, achieving 7-8% mIoU improvement on hepatocystic anatomy segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and fine-scale geometry of rare anatomical structures during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is critical for preventing surgical complications.

Method: Two segmentation models integrating ViT feature encoders with GNNs: (1) static k-NN graph with GCNII for stable long-range propagation, and (2) dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator with GAT for adaptive topology learning, evaluated on Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.

Result: 7-8% improvement in mIoU and 6% improvement in mDice scores over state-of-the-art baselines, with anatomically coherent predictions particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.

Conclusion: Graph-based segmentation enhances both performance and anatomical consistency by combining ViT global context with graph-based relational reasoning, improving interpretability and reliability for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

### [73] [Beyond Visual Cues: Leveraging General Semantics as Support for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16435)
*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Mengyu Liu,Honglong Chen,Weifeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes LDAG, a language-driven approach for few-shot segmentation that uses LLM-generated attribute descriptions instead of support images to provide unbiased meta guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSS methods rely on support images for meta guidance, but intra-class variations make this guidance inaccurate for untrained classes. The authors argue that unbiased meta guidance is more important than direct visual references from support images.

Method: LDAG architecture with two key modules: (1) Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) that uses LLMs to generate multiple detailed attribute descriptions of target classes, and (2) Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) that enables cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual features to address the text-vision modal shift.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot segmentation.

Conclusion: Using language-driven attribute generalization from LLMs provides more robust and unbiased support guidance for few-shot segmentation compared to traditional support image-based approaches, effectively handling intra-class variations and improving segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

*Diogo J. Paulo,João Martins,Hugo Proença,João C. Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreetView-Waste is a new dataset addressing urban waste container monitoring from garbage truck images, supporting detection, tracking, and overflow segmentation tasks with improved baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing litter detection datasets lack annotations for container tracking and are captured in static environments, limiting their utility for real-world waste management logistics in smart cities.

Method: Created StreetView-Waste dataset with three evaluation tasks, benchmarked state-of-the-art models, and proposed two strategies: heuristic-based tracking improvement and geometry-aware segmentation framework.

Result: Fine-tuned detectors achieved reasonable container detection, but tracking struggled; proposed heuristics reduced counting error by 79.6%. Geometry-aware strategy improved segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models.

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark for real-world perception systems in urban waste management, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs and specialized approaches for this domain.

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

### [75] [VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449)
*Ziyan Liu,Yeqiu Chen,Hongyi Cai,Tao Lin,Shuo Yang,Zheng Liu,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner is a novel token pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that addresses the limitations of existing VLM-specific pruning methods by considering both semantic understanding and action execution needs through dual-level importance criteria and temporal continuity exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing token pruning methods for Vision-Language Models focus only on semantic salience, ignoring the dual-system nature of VLA models that require both high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution, leading to degraded performance when critical action information is discarded.

Method: VLA-Pruner uses a dual-level importance criterion: vision-language prefill attention for semantic relevance and action decode attention (estimated via temporal smoothing) for action importance. It employs a dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under computational constraints.

Result: VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing token pruning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed VLA-Pruner successfully bridges the gap in VLA-specific token pruning by aligning with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploiting temporal continuity, providing a versatile plug-and-play solution for efficient Vision-Language-Action model deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of limited 3D training data for multi-modal language models by leveraging abundant 2D datasets instead, enabling 3D scene understanding without requiring 3D data.

Method: Create omnidirectional visual representations of 3D objects using multi-view 2D images from intermediate 3D scene reconstructions, inspired by Cubist painting techniques that show multiple viewpoints simultaneously.

Result: Outperforms previous 2D-based vision-language model solutions on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding tasks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: LLaVA³ demonstrates that effective 3D scene understanding can be achieved using only 2D multi-view images without model fine-tuning, providing a practical alternative to 3D data-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Conclusion: FastSurfer-CC provides an efficient, fully automated solution for corpus callosum morphometry that offers superior performance and enhanced sensitivity for detecting neurological disease effects compared to existing tools.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

*Eliyas Suleyman,Paul Henderson,Eksan Firkat,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic study on occluded video prediction, showing that incorporating point-flow and depth information improves performance in occluded scenarios and background motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video prediction faces inherent challenges with occlusion, and the authors hypothesize that explicit motion (point-flow) and geometric structure (depth-maps) information can help models perform better in occluded situations.

Method: Used a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture modified to incorporate depth and point-flow information, evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets using appearance-based metrics and Wasserstein distances on object masks.

Result: Models assisted with point-flow and depth performed better in occluded scenarios and predicted more accurate background motion compared to models without these modalities.

Conclusion: Explicit motion and geometric structure information significantly improves video prediction performance in occluded scenarios and background motion prediction.

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microrobot pose estimation methods require expensive, labor-intensive real microscope image datasets due to complex fabrication and labeling challenges. Digital twin systems struggle to replicate optical microscopy phenomena like diffraction artifacts.

Method: Novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework combining wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment with GAN to synthesize realistic microscope images efficiently.

Result: 35.6% improvement in SSIM over purely AI-driven methods with real-time rendering (0.022 s/frame). Pose estimator achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, only 5.0%/5.4% below real-data training. Generalizes to unseen poses without additional data.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations, bridging the gap between simulation and real microscopy while maintaining high accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

TL;DR: A method using acquisition time information via FiLM layers to improve breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI by addressing protocol and individual variation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Varying acquisition protocols and individual factors cause large appearance variations in DCE-MRI images, making automated tumor segmentation difficult even in the same imaging phase.

Method: Proposed tumor segmentation method that uses acquisition time information through feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers to modulate model features according to specific acquisition sequences, allowing use of variable number of images per study.

Result: Evaluation on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets showed that incorporating phase acquisition time knowledge improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Leveraging acquisition time information through FiLM layers effectively enhances breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI and improves model generalization across different datasets.

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

TL;DR: A novel method for jointly mapping indoor scenes and registering ceiling-mounted cameras using a mobile agent with RGB-D camera, achieving both tasks in a unified framework with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual registration of ceiling-mounted cameras is inefficient and costly, while automatic visual localization performs poorly with visual ambiguity. A joint approach is needed to address these challenges.

Method: Use a mobile agent with head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse scene while synchronized CMCs capture the agent. Create world-coordinate trajectories from egocentric videos and pseudo-scale trajectories from CMC videos. Align trajectories via timestamps and optimize using a customized factor graph.

Result: The method effectively accomplishes both scene mapping and CMC registration within a unified framework, jointly enhancing their performance. A new benchmark dataset was created for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable tool for downstream position-aware applications by enabling efficient joint mapping of indoor scenes and registration of ceiling-mounted cameras.

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of detecting synthetic images from rapidly evolving generative AI models, where traditional detection methods requiring frequent retraining become impractical.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Vision model trained via supervised contrastive learning on subset of generators, 2) k-NN classifier in embedding space using few-shot learning with limited samples from unseen generators.

Result: Achieves 91.3% detection accuracy with only 150 images per class, and improves source attribution by 14.70% AUC and 4.27% OSCR in open set classification.

Conclusion: The framework provides robust, scalable forensic attribution that adapts to evolving generative AI without exhaustive retraining, marking significant advancement in synthetic image detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models show mixed performance on negated or paraphrased text, posing challenges for vision-language alignment since negation changes meaning with minimal lexical changes while paraphrasing creates different expressions with the same meaning.

Method: Proposes SemCLIP with a new contrastive loss function that accounts for both paraphrasing and negation, using LLM-generated training triples (original, paraphrased, and negated captions) to train CLIP-like models.

Result: SemCLIP moves paraphrased captions closer to original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away. On CC-Neg benchmark, improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Shows better performance than CLIP on downstream zero-shot classification tasks.

Conclusion: SemCLIP achieves significant robustness to semantic transformations, particularly negation, while preserving CLIP's original performance, demonstrating improved alignment between vision and language representations.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

*Fan Yang,Shigeyuki Odashima,Shoichi Masui,Ikuo Kusajima,Sosuke Yamao,Shan Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust multi-camera tracking system for gymnastics that uses domain knowledge to handle limited camera views and detection failures by combining triangulation with ray-plane intersection when cross-view detections are insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gymnast tracking faces unique challenges due to space restrictions limiting camera numbers and detection failures from lighting variations, background changes, uniforms, and occlusions, making conventional multi-camera triangulation unreliable.

Method: Proposes a cascaded data association paradigm that uses triangulation when cross-view detections are sufficient, and ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient, leveraging the knowledge that gymnasts' 3D centers typically lie within predefined vertical planes during performance.

Result: The method demonstrates superior robustness over existing methods in challenging scenarios and has been successfully deployed at Gymnastics World Championships, earning recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Conclusion: Incorporating gymnastics domain knowledge through ray-plane intersection effectively compensates for uncertain trajectories and minimizes tracking failures in multi-camera gymnast tracking systems.

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Motivation: Early wildfire detection is crucial for damage mitigation, but deep learning approaches are limited by scarce annotated smoke datasets.

Method: Leverage generative AI to synthesize annotated smoke datasets, apply unsupervised domain adaptation for segmentation, and integrate style transfer, GANs, and image matting to enhance synthetic data realism.

Result: The methods aim to close the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, enabling more accurate smoke plume detection models.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Conclusion: EOGS++ provides a more efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction method for satellite imagery that eliminates preprocessing dependencies and improves geometric accuracy through integrated bundle adjustment.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world object detection faces class imbalance where many categories have few instances, biasing models toward frequent classes and degrading rare category performance.

Method: Two-stage Faster R-CNN with enhanced Balanced Group Softmax framework and metric learning to create well-separated feature embeddings, using k-NN for classification.

Result: Achieved new state-of-the-art performance with 24.5% mAP on LVISv1 dataset, surpassing previous benchmark of 24.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively mitigate class imbalance in long-tailed object detection, particularly improving performance on rare categories through better feature separation and classification.

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VARiant is a variant of Visual Auto-Regressive models that uses scale-depth asymmetric dependency to reduce memory overhead by employing subnets for later scales while maintaining early scales with the full network, achieving significant memory and speed improvements with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progressive multi-scale generation in VAR models incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment despite their inference step reduction benefits.

Method: Leverage scale-depth asymmetric dependency by selecting multiple subnets (16 to 2 layers) from the original 30-layer network, with early scales processed by full network and later scales by subnets. Use progressive training strategy to resolve optimization conflicts from weight sharing.

Result: VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95 baseline) with 40-65% memory reduction. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5x speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97).

Conclusion: VARiant provides a single-model architecture supporting zero-cost runtime depth switching, offering flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency for diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead of iterative train-prune-retrain cycles in unstructured pruning by developing a more efficient one-shot pruning method.

Method: Leverages gradient signals from teacher networks during importance score calculation to identify critical parameters, followed by sparsity-aware retraining without reactivating pruned connections.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (EPG, EPSD) at high sparsity levels on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet benchmarks with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: The framework provides a computation-efficient, performance-preserving pruning solution suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: POMA-3D successfully explores point maps as an effective approach to 3D scene understanding, addressing key challenges in 3D representation learning while demonstrating strong performance across multiple 3D tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

*George Cazenavette,Antonio Torralba,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Linear Gradient Matching, a dataset distillation method that optimizes synthetic images to match the gradients produced by real data when training linear classifiers on pre-trained vision models, enabling efficient training and model interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods focus on training randomly initialized models, but state-of-the-art vision approaches increasingly use pre-trained self-supervised models. The paper addresses the need to distill datasets specifically for optimal training of linear probes on top of such pre-trained models.

Method: Linear Gradient Matching optimizes synthetic images so that when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by real data. This enables efficient dataset distillation for pre-trained vision models.

Result: The method produces synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and generalize across different pre-trained vision models. For example, it enables training a linear CLIP probe using data distilled via a DINO backbone. The distilled datasets are particularly effective for fine-grained classification and provide tools for model interpretability.

Conclusion: Linear Gradient Matching provides an effective approach for dataset distillation in the context of pre-trained vision models, enabling efficient training, cross-model generalization, and valuable insights into model behavior and representation spaces.

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Erase to Retain is a medical image segmentation unlearning framework that uses teacher-student distillation with LoRA-constrained subspace updates to selectively remove lesion-specific knowledge while preserving anatomical understanding, achieving targeted forgetting without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for selective knowledge removal in medical segmentation networks for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and dataset revision, addressing the challenge of targeted forgetting without complete model retraining.

Method: Teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, featuring a strong unlearning phase with adversarial optimization to contradict teacher predictions on forget subsets, followed by gentle restoration phase with head-only supervised refinement.

Result: For ISIC segmentation: forget-set IoU reduced from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining performance on retain (0.647 to 0.677 IoU) and validation splits. For ISIC classification: forget accuracy decreased from 87.0% to 64.1% while retain accuracy improved from 83.9% to 90.6%. Cross-domain CHASE dataset showed consistent performance.

Conclusion: LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway for responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples while preserving essential performance.

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

TL;DR: SAM2S enhances SAM2 for surgical video segmentation by introducing DiveMem for long-term tracking, temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding, and ambiguity-resilient learning, achieving 80.42 average J&F score with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing iVOS models in surgical scenarios due to domain gap and limited long-term tracking capabilities.

Method: Proposes SAM2S with three key components: (1) DiveMem - trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking, (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding, and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies.

Result: SAM2S achieves 80.42 average J&F score, surpassing vanilla SAM2 by 17.10 points and fine-tuned SAM2 by 4.11 points, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SAM2S significantly advances surgical iVOS performance through specialized architectural enhancements and training strategies, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific adaptations for surgical video segmentation.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

### [99] [Adaptive Guided Upsampling for Low-light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16623)
*Angela Vivian Dcosta,Chunbo Song,Rafael Radkowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AGU is an efficient method for upscaling low-light images that simultaneously reduces noise and increases sharpness using guided image techniques with multi-parameter optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional guided image methods fail with low-light images due to high noise and low brightness, resulting in suboptimal improvements.

Method: Uses guided image method with multi-parameter optimization to learn associations between low-light and bright image characteristics from few sample image pairs.

Result: AGU renders high-quality images in real time from low-quality, low-resolution input and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-light scenarios.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the limitations of existing guided approaches for low-light image upscaling through learned multi-characteristic optimization.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

*Zeyuan Yin,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRIM is a post-training approach that accelerates 3D Gaussian diffusion models by reducing denoising trajectories and pruning redundant Gaussian primitives, improving efficiency without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from slow generation due to time-intensive denoising and processing of massive Gaussian primitives, limiting scalability along sampling trajectories.

Method: TRIM uses temporal trimming (lightweight selector model to evaluate latent primitives for early trajectory reduction) and spatial trimming (instance mask denoising to prune redundant background Gaussian primitives).

Result: Extensive experiments show TRIM significantly improves both efficiency and quality of 3D generation while supporting inference-time scaling.

Conclusion: TRIM provides an effective post-training solution to accelerate 3D Gaussian diffusion models without compromising output quality, enabling more scalable and efficient 3D generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

*Shuyu Cao,Chongshou Li,Jie Xu,Tianrui Li,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation that addresses multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance through a late-decoupled architecture with multiple decoders and a bi-branch supervision mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3DHS methods overlooked two key challenges: multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization with parameter-sharing models, and class imbalance across multiple hierarchies that dominates model performance with major classes.

Method: Proposes a framework with primary 3DHS branch and auxiliary discrimination branch. Uses late-decoupled architecture with multiple decoders and coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance. Introduces 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision for mutual supervision between branches.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate state-of-the-art 3DHS performance. Core components can be used as plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses multi-hierarchy conflicts and class imbalance in 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation, achieving superior performance while being adaptable to existing methods.

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

### [102] [Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16655)
*Vishaal Udandarao,Shyamgopal Karthik,Surabhi S. Nath,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper critically analyzes Cambrian-S's spatial supersensing benchmarks and methods, showing they can be solved without spatial cognition through simple baselines and are vulnerable to shortcut exploitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Cambrian-S's benchmarks and methods truly measure spatial supersensing capabilities or rely on shortcuts and simple heuristics.

Method: Introduced NoSense baseline using bag-of-words SigLIP model without temporal structure, and created VSC-Repeat test by concatenating videos with themselves to test robustness.

Result: NoSense achieved 95% accuracy on VSR benchmark without spatial cognition, and VSC-Repeat collapsed Cambrian-S's accuracy from 42% to 0%, revealing shortcut dependence.

Conclusion: Current VSI-Super benchmarks don't reliably measure spatial supersensing, and Cambrian-S's methods exploit shortcuts rather than demonstrating robust spatial supersensing.

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriDiff-4D is a novel diffusion-based pipeline that generates high-quality, controllable 4D avatars from text descriptions using triplane re-posing and auto-regressive generation, achieving significant improvements in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing 4D generative methods including temporal/geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics in 4D avatar generation.

Method: Uses diffusion-based triplane re-posing with auto-regressive strategy to generate arbitrary-length 4D sequences. First generates canonical 3D avatar and motion sequence from text, then animates avatar using second diffusion model. Learns 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating optimization process. Improves generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: TriDiff-4D enables efficient, high-quality skeleton-driven 4D generation with superior temporal consistency, motion accuracy, and visual fidelity compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

*Zhenyuan Qin,Xincheng Shuai,Henghui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneDesigner is a method for accurate multi-object 9D pose manipulation that uses a branched network with CNOCS maps for pose encoding, a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, and disentangled object sampling to address data imbalance and generation issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controllable image generation struggle with simultaneous control over 9D poses (location, size, orientation) of multiple objects, suffering from limited controllability and degraded quality.

Method: Proposes SceneDesigner with branched network architecture, CNOCS maps for 9D pose encoding, two-stage training with reinforcement learning using rebalanced data, and disentangled object sampling for inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality for multi-object 9D pose manipulation.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner enables accurate and flexible multi-object 9D pose control with improved training efficiency and generation quality, supported by the new ObjectPose9D dataset.

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

*Junhao Cheng,Liang Hou,Xin Tao,Jing Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP), extending traditional text-based next-event prediction to video responses, and presents VANS - a model that uses reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model with a Video Diffusion Model for generating dynamic video answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone, creating more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration beyond entertainment applications.

Method: VANS leverages reinforcement learning with Joint-GRPO to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM), optimizing the VLM to produce visualization-friendly captions while guiding the VDM to generate videos faithful to captions and input visual context.

Result: Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization.

Conclusion: VANS successfully addresses the VNEP task by orchestrating VLM and VDM as a unified system through reinforcement learning, enabling dynamic video responses for next-event prediction with improved accuracy and visualization quality.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

TL;DR: DualMindVLM enables visual language models to automatically switch between fast thinking (short responses) and slow thinking (detailed reasoning) modes based on task difficulty, improving computational efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs pursue lengthy reasoning chains for all tasks, leading to excessive computational costs, while human cognition efficiently allocates cognitive resources by using fast thinking for simple problems and slow thinking for complex ones.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Label data as fast/slow thinking based on model output length, 2) Train model using GRPO with thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking capabilities.

Result: DualMindVLM significantly outperforms base model and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art visual reasoning models while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed simple RL approach successfully enables VLMs to automatically adapt their reasoning depth based on task difficulty, achieving both computational efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LMM reasoning abilities without relying on human-curated data or external reward models, enabling autonomous and scalable improvement through purely unsupervised methods.

Method: Proposes a self-evolving framework with two agents from a single backbone model: Proposer generates diverse image-grounded questions, and Solver solves them through internal consistency, creating a continuous self-rewarding learning process.

Result: Achieves consistent gains up to ~3% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks (ChartQA, MathVista, MathVision) using only raw training images, with Qwen2.5-VL as base model.

Conclusion: EvoLMM provides a simple yet effective baseline for self-improving LMMs in fully-unsupervised fashion, demonstrating promising autonomous reasoning enhancement without external supervision.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar reconstructs animatable 3D human avatars from single or sparse images without requiring pose input, overcoming limitations of pose-dependent methods that degrade with noisy pose estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on accurate ground-truth camera and human poses for reconstruction, but performance significantly degrades when pose estimates are noisy, limiting practical applicability.

Method: Introduced NoPo-Avatar that reconstructs avatars solely from images without any pose input, eliminating dependence on human poses during test-time reconstruction.

Result: Experiments on THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K datasets show NoPo-Avatar outperforms baselines in practical settings without ground-truth poses and delivers comparable results in lab settings with ground-truth poses.

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar provides a more robust and widely applicable solution for 3D human avatar reconstruction by removing dependence on potentially noisy pose estimates.

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

Result: The benchmark systematically evaluates LLMs' instruction-following capabilities across multiple dimensions including multilingual settings and different instruction formats, providing comprehensive assessment of complex instruction adherence.

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench addresses the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to handle complex process instructions in task-oriented dialogues and enables systematic benchmarking of instruction-following capabilities with fine-grained constraints.

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

*Kieron Kretschmar,Walter Laurito,Sharan Maiya,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIARS' BENCH is a comprehensive testbed with 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses from four models across seven datasets, designed to evaluate lie detection techniques for LLMs in diverse settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lie detection techniques for LLMs are validated in narrow settings that don't capture the diverse types of lies models can generate, creating a need for more comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Created LIARS' BENCH testbed with examples across seven datasets, varying along two dimensions: model's reason for lying and object of belief targeted. Evaluated three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on this benchmark.

Result: Existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, particularly in settings where determining if the model lied from the transcript alone is impossible.

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior lie detection techniques and provides a practical testbed to guide future progress in detecting when LLMs generate false statements they believe are untrue.

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

### [113] [Learning Tractable Distributions Of Language Model Continuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16054)
*Gwen Yidou-Weng,Ian Li,Anji Liu,Oliver Broadrick,Guy Van den Broeck,Benjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTLA is a hybrid approach that combines a base language model with a tractable surrogate model to handle sequence-level constraints in controlled text generation, improving constraint satisfaction with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for controlled language generation use tractable surrogates like HMMs to approximate continuation distributions, but these are often weakly context aware, reducing query quality. The goal is to improve context awareness while maintaining tractability.

Method: LTLA pairs a base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. It uses a single batched HMM update for all next-token candidates and conditions only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed.

Result: LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where standalone HMMs cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks.

Conclusion: LTLA effectively addresses efficiency pitfalls in controlled language generation by combining neural context with tractable surrogate models, achieving better constraint satisfaction with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

We document the interactions of the human authors with GPT-5, as guiding examples of fruitful collaboration with AI. Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

TL;DR: ELPO is a novel ensemble learning-based framework for automatic prompt optimization that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by using voting mechanisms and shared generation strategies with different search methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt engineering is laborious and creates a bottleneck for LLM applications. Existing APO methods focus on single models/algorithms, limiting performance on complex tasks.

Method: Proposes ELPO framework using ensemble learning with voting mechanism, shared generation strategies, and different search methods. Introduces more efficient algorithms for prompt generation and search.

Result: ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, achieving 7.6 F1 score improvement on ArSarcasm dataset.

Conclusion: ELPO provides more accurate and robust automatic prompt optimization through ensemble learning approach, effectively addressing limitations of single-model APO methods.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), a new paradigm that selectively applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning modifications to only a subset of position indices, challenging the traditional approach of applying modifications to all indices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors question the necessity of traditional PEFT approaches that apply modifications to all position indices, suggesting that indiscriminate application may be unnecessary and potentially counterproductive for downstream task performance.

Method: The paper proposes TS-PEFT, where a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices rather than all indices, creating a more targeted fine-tuning approach.

Result: Experimental results show that applying PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous but may be counterproductive, while selective application to specific position indices can enhance performance on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: This study provides a fresh perspective on PEFT by advocating for more targeted modifications and offers a framework for future research to optimize fine-tuning processes for large models through selective parameter updates.

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

### [118] [SeSE: A Structural Information-Guided Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Hallucination Detection in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16275)
*Xingtao Zhao,Hao Peng,Dingli Su,Xianghua Zeng,Chunyang Liu,Jinzhi Liao,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SeSE is a novel uncertainty quantification framework that uses semantic structural entropy to detect hallucinations in LLMs by modeling semantic spaces as directed graphs and computing structural entropy after optimal compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UQ methods overlook latent semantic structural information, which could provide more precise uncertainty estimates for detecting hallucinations in safety-critical LLM applications.

Method: Developed adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction to capture directional dependencies, then defined SeSE as structural entropy of optimal semantic encoding tree after hierarchical abstraction and compression.

Result: Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including supervised methods and KLE.

Conclusion: SeSE provides a principled framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in LLMs by leveraging semantic structural information, enabling better hallucination detection through theoretically explicable methods.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

TL;DR: SDA is a training-free, model-agnostic alignment framework that dynamically adjusts LLM output probabilities using user instructions to improve alignment with human intent across helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their responses align with human intent without costly retraining or extensive supervision remains a critical challenge.

Method: Proposes SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free framework that dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions without requiring fine-tuning.

Result: SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs, achieving average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty, and 11.5% in harmlessness across diverse models and scenarios.

Conclusion: SDA provides an effective, lightweight, and resource-efficient solution for aligning LLM behavior with human intent during inference, supporting personalized preference alignment and integration with existing training-based strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Self-rewriting framework improves reasoning quality in large reasoning models by having models rewrite their own reasoning texts and learn from the improved versions, addressing issues like over-thinking and disordered reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches with outcome correctness rewards provide limited supervision over internal reasoning processes, leading to suboptimal reasoning quality with issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking.

Method: Proposes a self-rewriting framework where models rewrite their own reasoning texts, using selective rewriting on 'simple' samples (consistently correct) to preserve original reward signals. Implementation combines rewriting and vanilla generation in single batches with minimal overhead.

Result: Achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) without explicit length reduction instructions. Significantly higher internal reasoning quality scores (+7.2) under LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

Conclusion: Self-rewriting framework effectively improves both reasoning accuracy and internal reasoning quality while reducing reasoning length, outperforming existing baselines across diverse tasks and model sizes.

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of idiomatic and figurative language understanding in LLMs by creating new datasets for training and evaluation. The authors compiled idiom lists from existing datasets, extracted context sequences from a large corpus, and created three datasets (one large-scale and two human-annotated) to improve idiom recognition and figurative language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Idiomatic and figurative language remains a significant challenge for LLMs despite large training corpora, as these expressions often elude current models. There's a need for better datasets to improve model performance on informal language commonly found in social media and colloquial speech.

Method: The authors compiled a combined idiom list from recent idiom datasets, then retrieved context sequences from a large corpus. They created three datasets: one large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic expressions and two human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic expressions. These were post-processed for model-agnostic training and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging tasks.

Result: The paper presents new datasets specifically designed for idiomatic and figurative language processing. These datasets enable evaluation of pre-trained language models' baseline abilities in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition tasks.

Conclusion: The created datasets provide a foundation for building new models and developing improved approaches for figurative language understanding in LLMs, helping to narrow the performance gap in processing idiomatic expressions.

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the limitations of sufficiency as a metric for rationale informativeness and explores its relationship with token classification and attention regularization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rationale evaluation metrics like sufficiency provide limited insight into how rationale information affects model performance, particularly in distinguishing between learning correct reasoning vs. dataset shortcuts.

Method: The study relates sufficiency to two modeling approaches: token classification (identifying rationale tokens) and attention regularization (incorporating rationales in inputs), examining cross-domain classification performance.

Result: Highly informative rationales don't necessarily help correct classification; sufficiency captures interference from non-rationalized context; rationale incorporation can boost cross-domain performance but inconsistently; sufficiency and token classification appear unrelated.

Conclusion: Rationale evaluation is complex, and current metrics like sufficiency don't systematically capture rationale informativeness, highlighting the need for better evaluation methods.

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML is a novel HTML-to-text extraction pipeline that uses a 0.6B-parameter language model to reformulate content extraction as sequence labeling, significantly outperforming heuristic-based methods like Trafilatura in preserving structured elements and improving downstream model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors that struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements like formulas, codes, and tables. The authors hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance.

Method: MinerU-HTML reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. It employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown, leveraging semantic understanding rather than text-density heuristics.

Result: On MainWebBench (7,887 annotated web pages), MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9% for code blocks, 94.0% for formulas). Models trained on AICC (7.3-trillion token corpus) achieve 50.8% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming Trafilatura-extracted corpus by 1.08 percentage points.

Conclusion: HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction. MinerU-HTML demonstrates that model-based extraction approaches significantly improve both extraction quality and downstream model performance compared to heuristic methods.

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

Motivation: To explore whether machine learning and deep learning models can effectively differentiate between perceived lower-quality and higher-quality news articles, addressing the challenge of news quality assessment at scale.

Method: Used 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models on a dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from Common Crawl (2018-2024), with expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites split at median to create quality classes, featuring 194 linguistic features per website-level labeled article.

Result: Random Forest achieved 0.7355 accuracy and 0.8131 ROC AUC. ModernBERT-large (256 context) performed best with 0.8744 accuracy, 0.9593 ROC-AUC, and 0.8739 F1, followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC.

Conclusion: Both traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers can effectively differentiate the perceived quality of worldwide news articles, with deep learning models showing superior performance in this classification task.

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

*Andrew Gomes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how transformer-based language models process idiomatic expressions using circuit discovery techniques, identifying specialized "Idiom Heads" and "augmented reception" mechanisms that help balance computational efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformers handle non-compositional language like idioms, which don't follow standard compositional rules, and to discover the computational mechanisms behind idiom processing.

Method: Used modified path patching algorithm for circuit discovery and analysis, identifying specialized attention heads ("Idiom Heads") and analyzing enhanced attention patterns between idiom tokens ("augmented reception").

Result: Found distinct computational patterns for idiom processing, identified Idiom Heads that activate across different idioms, and discovered augmented reception where earlier processing enhances attention between idiom tokens.

Conclusion: The findings reveal how transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness when handling non-compositional language, providing insights into processing complex grammatical constructions.

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

### [128] [TurkColBERT: A Benchmark of Dense and Late-Interaction Models for Turkish Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16528)
*Özay Ezerceli,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Selva Taş,Reyhan Bayraktar,Fatma Betül Terzioğlu,Yusuf Çelebi,Yağız Asker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT is the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish information retrieval, showing that parameter-efficient late-interaction models significantly outperform larger dense encoders while enabling low-latency retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural information retrieval systems are well-developed for high-resource languages but underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages like Turkish. While dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, late-interaction models that retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching haven't been systematically evaluated.

Method: Two-stage adaptation pipeline: fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. Evaluates 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains.

Result: Strong parameter efficiency: 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600× smaller than 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models 3-5× smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8% mAP on domain-specific tasks. MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33× faster than PLAID with +1.7% relative mAP gain.

Conclusion: Late-interaction models offer superior performance and efficiency for Turkish IR compared to dense encoders. The benchmark enables low-latency retrieval with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets and translated benchmarks, with larger-scale evaluations needed.

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

TL;DR: This paper presents a predictive framework that can identify text genre from LLM activations using shallow learning models, achieving high F1-scores up to 98% with Mistral-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding LLMs is crucial for safe deployment, but complicated by interpretability challenges and the impracticality of human-evaluating all outputs. The research aims to develop methods to extract meaningful information from LLM internal representations.

Method: Used Mistral-7B and two datasets to predict text genre based on LLM activations. Employed scikit-learn classifiers to analyze the relationship between activation patterns and text genres.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% across two datasets, consistently outperforming control tasks. Demonstrated that text genres can be reliably inferred from LLM activations.

Conclusion: The study provides proof of concept that shallow learning models can successfully extract text genre information from LLM activations, offering a promising approach for understanding LLM internal representations without complex interpretability methods.

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

*Zachary Ellis,Jared Joselowitz,Yash Deo,Yajie He,Anna Kalygina,Aisling Higham,Mana Rahimzadeh,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli,Ernest Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper challenges the use of Word Error Rate (WER) for evaluating ASR in clinical dialogue, showing poor correlation with clinical impact. It introduces an LLM-as-a-Judge framework optimized with GEPA that achieves human-comparable performance for assessing clinical safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ASR evaluations rely heavily on WER, but this may not reflect the actual clinical impact of transcription errors in medical settings where patient safety is critical.

Method: Established gold-standard benchmark with expert clinicians labeling clinical impact of ASR errors, then introduced LLM-as-a-Judge framework optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment.

Result: WER and existing metrics correlate poorly with clinician-assigned risk labels. The optimized Gemini-2.5-Pro judge achieved 90% accuracy and Cohen's κ of 0.816, demonstrating human-comparable performance.

Conclusion: Provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond textual fidelity to scalable assessment of clinical safety, addressing the gap between technical accuracy and clinical impact.

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

*Kexin Zhao,Ken Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for word sense disambiguation that uses statistical language models as oracles without requiring hand-annotated training data, converting candidate meanings into natural language alternatives for LLM-based selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current word sense disambiguation methods are limited to coarse-grained representations and require hand-annotated training data, making it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations needed for sophisticated inference.

Method: Convert multiple candidate meanings from symbolic NLU systems into distinguishable natural language alternatives, query LLMs to select appropriate interpretations based on linguistic context, and propagate selected meanings back to the symbolic system.

Result: The method was evaluated against human-annotated gold answers and demonstrated effectiveness in disambiguating word senses.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective way to perform word sense disambiguation for richer representations without requiring hand-annotated training data, leveraging LLMs as oracles for interpretation selection.

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval outperforms text-based approaches in multimodal RAG systems by preserving visual context, achieving significant improvements in retrieval metrics and answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images to text, causing loss of contextual information and visual details critical for retrieval and QA in financial documents.

Method: Comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches: text-based chunk retrieval (images summarized into text) vs direct multimodal embedding retrieval (images stored natively in vector space), evaluated across 6 LLM models and 2 multimodal embedding models on a financial earnings call benchmark.

Result: Direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches with 13% absolute improvement in mAP@5 and 11% in nDCG@5, corresponding to 32% and 20% relative improvements respectively, and produces more accurate and factually consistent answers.

Conclusion: LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, while direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for superior retrieval and inference performance in multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

Result: Enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior, demonstrated through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction.

Conclusion: The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.

Abstract: Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: CLD enables fine-grained, controllable multi-layer separation of raster images using LD-DiT for element decoupling and MLCA for precise conditional generation, outperforming existing methods and supporting direct editing in design tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current workflows allow independent layer editing before composition but make layer-level editing irreversible after compositing, with existing methods lacking controllability and segmentation precision.

Method: Two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT) for decoupling image elements into distinct layers with fine-grained control, and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA) for injecting target image information into multi-layer tokens for precise conditional generation.

Result: CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in decomposition quality and controllability, with separated layers directly manipulable in design tools like PowerPoint.

Conclusion: CLD provides practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows by enabling reversible layer editing and precise multi-layer separation.

Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual LLMs suffer from weaknesses like inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification in text categorization tasks, which limits their reliability and accuracy.

Method: The eLLM framework integrates multiple LLMs through a mathematical model of collective decision-making with principled aggregation criteria, evaluated on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs using the IAB hierarchical taxonomy on 8,660 human-annotated samples under zero-shot conditions.

Result: eLLM achieved up to 65% improvement in F1-score over the strongest single model, with individual models plateauing due to text compression issues, while the ensemble approach improved both robustness and accuracy to near human-expert-level performance.

Conclusion: The ensemble framework offers a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that can significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As multi-agent reinforcement learning systems are deployed in safety-critical applications, understanding decision-making processes and collective behaviors becomes crucial, but existing explainable AI methods fail in multi-agent settings.

Method: MACIE combines structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations addressing individual causal contributions, system-level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics, and actionable natural language narratives.

Result: Evaluation across four MARL scenarios showed accurate outcome attribution (mean φ_i = 5.07, std < 0.05), detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks (synergy index up to 0.461), and efficient computation (0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU).

Conclusion: MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi-agent support while remaining practical for real-time use, representing a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi-agent AI.

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

*Bo Wen,Chen Wang,Erhan Bilal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates how different input modalities (text vs. images) affect perception and reasoning on ARC-AGI tasks, finding that structured text captures coordinates well while images preserve 2D shapes, and combining modalities improves execution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different input encodings (text vs. images) shape model perception in ARC-AGI tasks and separate instruction errors from execution errors, since current systems lack principled accounts of how modality affects perception.

Method: Used a two-stage reasoning pipeline with weighted set-disagreement metric to isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities, testing how modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks.

Result: Structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes but are resolution-sensitive, and combining modalities improves execution by about 8 perception points and 0.20 median similarity.

Conclusion: Aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolMind is a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic and 200k augmented data instances, featuring turn-level validation to prevent error propagation during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality trajectories hinders LLM agent development, and existing validation methods overlook turn-level errors that degrade model performance.

Method: Construct function graphs based on parameter correlations, use multi-agent framework for user-assistant-tool interactions, and employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous steps.

Result: Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolMind's turn-level validation approach mitigates error amplification while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals for robust tool-use learning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

### [140] [Chain of Summaries: Summarization Through Iterative Questioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15719)
*William Brach,Lukas Galke Poech*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoS generates information-dense summaries of web content for LLMs using Hegel's dialectical method, outperforming baselines by up to 66% and specialized methods by up to 27%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with web content due to unfriendly formats and context length limits, needing digestible plain-text repositories.

Method: Chain of Summaries (CoS) iteratively refines summaries through thesis-antithesis-synthesis dialectical process to create general-purpose summaries.

Result: CoS outperforms zero-shot LLMs by 66% and specialized methods by 27%, yields higher Q&A performance with fewer tokens, and is LLM-agnostic.

Conclusion: CoS provides website maintainers with an appealing option to make content more LLM-accessible while retaining human oversight.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

*Islem Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This thesis develops a multimodal AI framework combining text and image analysis to identify construction safety hazards, testing both proprietary LLMs and lightweight open-source VLMs on accident reports and site imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Construction sites generate safety data in multiple formats (text reports, images), making traditional hazard synthesis challenging. A multimodal approach can better integrate these diverse data sources for comprehensive safety monitoring.

Method: Two case studies: 1) Hybrid pipeline using GPT-4o models to extract insights from 28,000 OSHA accident reports; 2) Evaluation of lightweight VLMs (Molmo 7B, Qwen2 VL 2B) on ConstructionSite10k dataset for rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts.

Result: Proprietary LLMs effectively extracted structured insights from text reports. Lightweight VLMs showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations despite smaller size, demonstrating feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for safety monitoring.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI frameworks combining text and visual analysis are viable for construction safety hazard identification, with lightweight open-source models offering cost-effective alternatives to proprietary systems while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

*Weichen Liu,Qiyao Xue,Haoming Wang,Xiangyu Yin,Boyuan Yang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This survey paper introduces a cognitive-based taxonomy for spatial reasoning in MLLMs, organizing tasks by reasoning complexity rather than input modality, and analyzes methods for improving spatial abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial reasoning remains a major challenge for MLLMs, and existing surveys focus on input modalities rather than the cognitive aspects of spatial intelligence. The authors aim to provide a more principled framework for understanding and comparing spatial reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors develop a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from a cognitive perspective, dividing tasks by reasoning complexity and linking them to cognitive functions. They map existing benchmarks across different settings (text-only, vision-language, embodied) onto this taxonomy and review evaluation metrics.

Result: The cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. The analysis clarifies strengths and complementary mechanisms of different improvement methods.

Conclusion: The survey provides researchers with a comprehensive understanding of spatial reasoning in MLLMs and actionable directions for future research by offering a cognitive-based taxonomy and analyzing both training-based and reasoning-based improvement approaches.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

*Hyo-Jeong Jang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This thesis proposes a consistency-guided cross-modal transfer framework for uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning, using cross-modal semantic consistency to improve robustness against noisy data, imperfect labels, and heterogeneous modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal learning faces uncertainty from noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics, especially critical in human-computer interaction settings where data quality and annotation consistency vary.

Method: Projects heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space using cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning, mitigating modality gaps and uncovering structural relations for uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning.

Result: Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks show significant improvements in model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy/incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses reveal reliable cross-modal structure capture under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: Provides a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, offering practical insights for developing reliable brain-computer interface systems.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

*Hanzhi Yan,Qin Lu,Xianqiao Wang,Xiaoming Zhai,Tianming Liu,He Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a dual-module framework combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics education, addressing knowledge gaps and multi-step reasoning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific knowledge in biomechanics and decline in performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks requiring calculation and analysis.

Method: Developed a dual-module framework: 1) RAG for improving specificity and logical consistency in conceptual true/false questions, 2) MAS for solving calculation-oriented problems with multi-step reasoning and code execution. Evaluated Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B on 100 biomechanics questions.

Result: RAG significantly enhanced LLM performance and stability in conceptual questions, surpassing vanilla models. MAS successfully performed multi-step reasoning, equation derivation, code execution, and generated explainable solutions for calculation tasks.

Conclusion: RAG and MAS demonstrate strong potential for enhancing LLM performance in specialized engineering courses, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring systems in engineering education.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

### [145] [Multi-Agent LLM Orchestration Achieves Deterministic, High-Quality Decision Support for Incident Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15755)
*Philip Drammeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent orchestration dramatically improves LLM-based incident response quality, achieving 100% actionable recommendations vs 1.7% for single-agent approaches, with zero quality variance across trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent LLM approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations for incident response, limiting their practical deployment in production systems despite the promise of accelerating response times.

Method: Developed MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework comparing single-agent copilot vs multi-agent systems through 348 controlled trials on identical incident scenarios, introducing Decision Quality (DQ) metric.

Result: Multi-agent orchestration achieved 100% actionable recommendation rate (vs 1.7% single-agent), 80x improvement in action specificity, 140x improvement in solution correctness, with zero quality variance across all trials.

Conclusion: Multi-agent orchestration transforms from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response, enabling deterministic quality and SLA commitments impossible with single-agent approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

*Raymond K. Sheh,Karen Geappen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in systematic assessment of AI supply chain risks and proposes a taxonomy to help stakeholders systematically inventory dependencies across AI systems in critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a significant gap in assessing supply chain risks in AI systems, particularly problematic when AI is used in critical applications like healthcare, utilities, and transport, where current risk assessments focus mainly on algorithmic bias and model hallucinations but miss the complex web of dependencies.

Method: The authors survey current AI risk assessment practices and then develop a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities to help stakeholders systematically identify and manage dependencies.

Result: The paper presents a taxonomy that enables stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems and ask the right questions about supply chain risks.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy bridges the gap between current AI governance practices and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications by providing a systematic framework for understanding AI supply chain dependencies.

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of rule-based NLP methods vs LLMs for extracting medical information from Polish EHRs, showing rule-based methods have higher accuracy while LLMs offer better adaptability and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text in non-English contexts where NLP resources are scarce, particularly in Polish healthcare settings.

Method: Comparative evaluation of low-compute rule-based NLP methods and Large Language Models for extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and medications from Polish EHRs, examining effects of text normalization and translation-induced information loss.

Result: Rule-based methods achieved higher accuracy for information retrieval tasks (especially age and sex extraction), while LLMs showed greater adaptability and scalability with better performance in drug name recognition. Translation from Polish to English caused information loss affecting LLM effectiveness.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining rule-based system precision with LLM adaptability offer the most practical path for reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospital settings, balancing accuracy, normalization, and computational costs.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an intelligent tutoring system that helps medical trainees improve their chest X-ray interpretation skills by combining multiple modalities (spatial annotations, gaze tracking, text observations) and providing personalized, evidence-based feedback while preventing premature disclosure of answers.

Method: Uses an AutoGen-based multi-agent workflow with specialized agents for evaluating localization quality, generating Socratic coaching, retrieving PubMed evidence, suggesting similar cases from REFLACX dataset, and triggering NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning. Implements Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for skill mastery tracking and lung-lobe segmentation for anatomically aware gaze feedback.

Result: The system demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility for live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR successfully integrates multiple AI components into a unified tutoring system that provides personalized, evidence-based feedback for chest X-ray interpretation training, showing promise for improving trainee skills while maintaining appropriate educational safeguards.

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the puzzling phenomenon where audio language models perform better without reasoning, and to determine if audio intelligence can truly benefit from deliberate thinking like text and vision models do.

Method: Proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework that teaches the model to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains grounded in acoustic features rather than disconnected deliberations.

Result: Step-Audio-R1 exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music.

Conclusion: Reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when properly anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence, opening pathways for truly multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

*Ivan Chulo,Ananya Joshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how activation steering improves Theory of Mind in LLMs, finding that improved belief attribution is mediated by enhanced emotional processing rather than analytical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind how activation steering improves Theory of Mind in language models, specifically what cognitive changes occur that lead to different outputs.

Method: Decomposed ToM by comparing steered vs baseline LLM activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions, applied Contrastive Activation Addition steering to Gemma-3-4B, and evaluated on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios.

Result: Improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5% to 46.7% accuracy) was mediated by activations processing emotional content (emotion perception +2.23, emotion valuing +2.20) while suppressing analytical processes (questioning -0.78, convergent thinking -1.59).

Conclusion: Successful Theory of Mind abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding rather than analytical reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

TL;DR: A self-correcting framework for LLMs that detects hallucinations during multi-step reasoning using fine-grained uncertainty signals (confidence alignment and token-level entropy spikes) and improves reasoning through reinforcement learning with composite rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in large language models during multi-step reasoning by detecting unreliable reasoning in real-time rather than just evaluating final answer correctness.

Method: Uses fine-grained uncertainty signals (self-assessed confidence alignment and token-level entropy spikes) to detect unreliable reasoning, designs composite reward function to penalize unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, and applies reinforcement learning with confidence-aware reward feedback.

Result: The method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each uncertainty signal.

Conclusion: The self-correcting framework successfully makes LLMs more introspective, improving not just outcome correctness but also the coherence and faithfulness of intermediate reasoning steps through real-time detection and mitigation of hallucinations.

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeBoard is a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess answer correctness without requiring answer comparisons. It introduces MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a multi-agent framework that uses multiple interacting SLMs to achieve LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models (SLMs) have unclear ability to judge answer correctness compared to LLMs. Existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks rely on indirect answer comparisons with predefined metrics, which are difficult to automate and offer limited support for fine-grained, scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs.

Method: Proposed JudgeBoard pipeline directly queries models to assess correctness without extra answer comparisons. Focused on mathematical and science/commonsense reasoning domains. Constructed task-specific evaluation leaderboards using accuracy-based ranking and Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets. Introduced MAJ framework using multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles for collaborative deliberation.

Result: Experimental results show significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. MAJ framework substantially improves reliability and consistency of SLMs. On MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models performs comparably or better than larger-sized counterparts. Multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, enabling scalable and efficient assessment. The MAJ framework demonstrates that collaborative deliberation among multiple SLMs can achieve judgment accuracy comparable to larger models.

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

*Zhe Li,Yehan Qiu,Yujie Chen,Xiang Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KRAL is a novel paradigm that enhances clinical LLMs through knowledge distillation, semi-supervised data augmentation, and agentic reinforcement learning, achieving superior performance at reduced costs compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, privacy concerns, high costs, and limited reasoning capabilities in complex antimicrobial therapy scenarios.

Method: Uses teacher-model reasoning for knowledge distillation via answer-to-question reverse generation, heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (80% reduction in manual annotation), and agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance knowledge and reasoning while optimizing efficiency.

Result: Significantly outperforms RAG and SFT: Accuracy@1 on MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG; Pass@1 on PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG, achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs.

Conclusion: KRAL establishes an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support systems.

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

*Shahin Zanbaghi,Ryan Rostampour,Farhan Abid,Salim Al Jarmakani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis and canary baseline comparison effectively identifies backdoored LLMs (sleeper agents) with 92.5% accuracy, 100% precision, and 85% recall in real-time without model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific conditions while appearing safe during training, and existing safety training fails to remove these backdoors, creating a critical security gap in AI deployment with no practical detection methods available.

Method: A novel dual-method system using Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines combined with injected canary questions that monitor response consistency, operating in real-time without requiring model modifications.

Result: The system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall when evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, with detection operating in real-time (<1s per query).

Conclusion: Embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency, providing the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection and addressing a critical security gap in AI deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

*Deepthi Potluri,Aby Mammen Mathew,Jeffrey B DeWitt,Alexander L. Rasgon,Yide Hao,Junyuan Hong,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with clinical reasoning even when provided with correct evidence, requiring evaluation frameworks that assess reasoning quality beyond just retrieval accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between retrieval and reasoning in LLMs, especially in clinical settings where outputs must follow structured protocols like Written Exposure Therapy guidelines.

Method: Proposed an evaluation framework measuring accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning using clinician-vetted questions and authoritative passages.

Result: Found persistent reasoning errors even with correct evidence; RAG can constrain outputs but safe deployment requires rigorous reasoning assessment.

Conclusion: Safe deployment of LLMs in clinical settings requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval, highlighting both potential and risks of RAG systems.

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

### [160] [An Aligned Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16045)
*Jorge A. Huertas,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel Constraint Programming model for serial batch scheduling with minimum batch sizes that eliminates the need for predefined virtual batches, using direct sequence reasoning and improved search strategies to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CP models for serial batch scheduling rely on predefined virtual batches which suffer from dimensionality issues and complexity. This is problematic for practical applications like semiconductor manufacturing where minimum batch sizes are required.

Method: Proposes a CP model that uses key alignment parameters to reason directly on sequences of same-family jobs, avoiding virtual batches. Enhanced with tailored search phases and strengthened constraint propagators.

Result: Extensive testing on 5000 instances shows superiority on small-to-medium instances (up to 100 jobs) and finds solutions up to 25% better than existing methods on large instances (up to 500 jobs, 10 families, 10 machines).

Conclusion: The novel CP approach provides a more compact formulation and better performance than existing MIP, tabu search, and CP methods for serial batch scheduling with minimum batch sizes.

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

*Theophanis C. Stratopoulos,Victor Xiaoqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for classifying AI-accounting research along two dimensions (research focus and methodological approach) and analyzes how GenAI and LLMs are transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in generative AI and large language models are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for accounting scholars that need to be systematically understood.

Method: The paper develops a classification framework with two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric vs AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based vs traditional methods). This framework is applied to papers from IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research in leading journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities.

Result: The analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. Accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration.

Conclusion: The transformations call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency, as human researchers maintain value in areas requiring judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth despite AI advancements.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

TL;DR: Proactive cloud-edge workload management using hybrid CNN-LSTM forecasting embedded in multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning, outperforming reactive methods by optimizing cost, performance, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reactive resource management with static thresholds leads to overspending or performance degradation; need proactive solutions that anticipate problems rather than react to them.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining CNN-LSTM model for time series forecasting with multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning orchestrator, embedding predictive forecasts directly into DRL agent state space.

Result: System significantly outperforms traditional methods, effectively handles complex decision-making and multiple competing objectives (cost, speed, reliability).

Conclusion: The approach enables smarter AI management by providing "foresight" capabilities, allowing long-term planning and smooth optimization rather than reactive problem-solving.

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

Motivation: To create an efficient framework for training and evaluating multi-turn, long-horizon agents with seamless integration to existing RL frameworks, addressing the need for improved training efficiency and cost reduction in software engineering agents.

Method: Developed SkyRL-Agent framework with optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher (1.55x speedup) and tool-enhanced training using AST-based search tool for code navigation. Trained SA-SWE-32B from Qwen3-32B purely with reinforcement learning.

Result: SA-SWE-32B achieved 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with over 2x cost reduction compared to prior models. The agent also generalized effectively to other tasks including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena despite being trained only on SWE tasks.

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent provides an efficient and extensible framework for agent training, demonstrating significant performance improvements and cost reductions in software engineering tasks while maintaining strong generalization capabilities across different agentic domains.

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MR-RML is a novel alignment framework that addresses LLM limitations in medical practice through multidimensional rubric-oriented reward model learning with geometric projection constraints, achieving state-of-the-art performance on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs face critical alignment challenges in medical applications: disconnect from dynamic clinical needs, difficulty adapting to evolving medical standards, and inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced medical quality criteria.

Method: Proposes MR-RML via GPRC framework with three innovations: (1) 'Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines' medical standard system, (2) independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical logic into mathematical regularization.

Result: Achieves substantial performance gains over base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on full subset, 85% on Hard subset), reaches SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full) and 44.7 (hard), and outperforms most closed-source models on Healthbench benchmark.

Conclusion: MR-RML successfully addresses key alignment challenges in medical LLMs by integrating structured medical standards into the training pipeline, enabling more clinically relevant and consistent performance through multidimensional reward modeling and geometric constraints.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

*Jeremie Ochin,Raphael Chekroun,Bogdan Stanciulescu,Sotiris Manitsaris*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FOOTPASS is the first benchmark dataset for play-by-play action spotting in soccer that combines computer vision outputs with tactical knowledge to automate reliable play-by-play data extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current action recognition methods are insufficient for reliable play-by-play data automation in soccer, while tactical modeling research has advanced but requires better automated data extraction. There's a need to integrate computer vision with tactical knowledge for more automated and reliable play-by-play data generation.

Method: Created FOOTPASS dataset that enables player-centric action spotting by exploiting both computer vision outputs (tracking, identification) and prior soccer tactical knowledge over long time horizons to generate play-by-play data streams.

Result: The first benchmark dataset for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context, enabling development of methods that combine vision and tactical knowledge.

Conclusion: FOOTPASS provides an essential foundation for developing automated play-by-play data extraction methods that integrate computer vision with tactical knowledge, which is crucial for data-driven sports analytics.

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

TL;DR: OpenMMReasoner is a transparent two-stage training recipe for multimodal reasoning that uses supervised fine-tuning with 874K samples and reinforcement learning with 74K samples, achieving 11.6% improvement over baseline models across nine benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies in multimodal reasoning research creates barriers to scalable progress, despite recent advancements in large reasoning models.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning with 874K-sample cold-start dataset featuring step-by-step validation, 2) Reinforcement learning with 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to sharpen and stabilize reasoning capabilities.

Result: Achieves 11.6% improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance and establishing a solid empirical foundation.

Conclusion: The work highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in multimodal reasoning performance and provides a fully transparent, open-sourced framework for future research in this domain.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research.

### [167] [From Performance to Understanding: A Vision for Explainable Automated Algorithm Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16201)
*Niki van Stein,Anna V. Kononova,Thomas Bäck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a vision for explainable automated algorithm design that combines LLM-driven discovery with systematic benchmarking and problem-class descriptors to create interpretable, class-specific algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based automated algorithm design is performance-driven but opaque, lacking explanations for why generated algorithms work, which components matter, or how design choices relate to problem structures.

Method: Three-pillar approach: (1) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (2) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters, (3) problem-class descriptors connecting algorithm behavior to landscape structure.

Result: Forms a closed knowledge loop where discovery, explanation, and generalization reinforce each other, shifting from blind search to interpretable algorithm design.

Conclusion: This integration will accelerate progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimization strategies succeed, moving the field toward explainable automated algorithm design.

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

### [168] [TOFA: Training-Free One-Shot Federated Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16423)
*Li Zhang,Zhongxuan Han,XiaoHua Feng,Jiaming Zhang,Yuyuan Li,Linbo Jiang,Jianan Lin,Chaochao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TOFA is a training-free one-shot federated adaptation framework for Vision-Language Models that addresses data heterogeneity without requiring additional client or server training resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated VLM adaptation methods have high communication costs and security risks due to iterative training, while current one-shot approaches fail to fully exploit multimodal information and handle data heterogeneity effectively.

Method: TOFA uses visual and textual pipelines: a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized class prototypes visually, while text prompts are evaluated and globally aligned. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism balances both modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate TOFA's effectiveness in handling data heterogeneity while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: TOFA provides an efficient, training-free solution for federated VLM adaptation that effectively leverages multimodal information and addresses data heterogeneity through balanced personalization and robustness.

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

*Pei Yang,Ke Zhang,Ji Wang,Xiao Chen,Yuxin Tang,Eric Yang,Lynn Ai,Bill Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CRM is a multi-agent collaborative reward model framework that replaces single black-box reward models with specialized evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF, addressing issues with optimizing multiple conflicting preference dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple conflicting preference dimensions (factuality, helpfulness, safety) and lack transparency in score assignment, motivating the need for a more robust and interpretable approach.

Method: Decomposes preference evaluation into domain-specific agents producing partial signals, combined with global evaluators like ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties.

Result: The framework yields a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines, with policy optimized via advantage-based updates and value model regressing to aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without additional human annotations.

Conclusion: CRM and the accompanying rewardBench benchmark provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization in RLHF systems.

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

TL;DR: D-GARA is a dynamic benchmarking framework that evaluates Android GUI agent robustness against real-world anomalies like permission dialogs and battery warnings, revealing significant performance degradation in current agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agent datasets are static and idealized, failing to capture real-world complexity and anomalies that agents commonly encounter in practice.

Method: Proposed D-GARA framework with diverse real-world anomalies, constructed benchmark with Android apps containing embedded anomalies, and conducted comprehensive experiments on state-of-the-art GUI agents.

Result: Substantial performance degradation observed in GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, demonstrating the vulnerability of current approaches to real-world interruptions.

Conclusion: D-GARA highlights the need for robustness-aware learning in GUI agents and provides a modular, extensible framework for evaluating agent performance in realistic scenarios with various anomaly types.

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

*Xu Qiang,Shengyuan Bai,Leqing Chen,Zijing Liu,Yu Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChemO is a new benchmark from the International Chemistry Olympiad 2025 that addresses chemistry's multimodal challenges through Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation and Structured Visual Enhancement. The ChemLabs multi-agent framework achieves state-of-the-art performance of 93.6/100, surpassing human gold medal thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemistry has remained an open challenge for AI reasoning due to its unique multimodal symbolic language, unlike mathematics and physics which already have Olympiad-level benchmarks. There's a need for automated assessment methods that can handle chemistry's visual and symbolic complexity.

Method: Two key innovations: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER) converts visual output problems into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE) disentangles visual perception from chemical reasoning. The ChemLabs framework uses hierarchical multi-agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing.

Result: Experiments show dramatic performance gains when combining SVE with the multi-agent system. The top configuration achieves 93.6 out of 100 points, surpassing estimated human gold medal thresholds and establishing new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Conclusion: ChemO successfully addresses the challenge of automated chemical reasoning through innovative assessment methods and multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating that AI can achieve expert-level performance in complex chemistry problem-solving.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets are costly and often rely on synthetic samples with hallucination and limited diversity, while textbooks contain abundant high-quality human-authored QA content that remains underexploited due to PDF transformation difficulties.

Method: Combines layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing to extract well-formed QA and visual-QA pairs from educational documents, transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision.

Result: Experiments across diverse document types show the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs, enabling scalable use of real-world educational content.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training, with all code and data-processing pipelines open-sourced.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

### [173] [Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248)
*Yun Lu,Xiaoyu Shi,Hong Xie,Chongjun Xia,Zhenhui Gong,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for fair interactive recommendation that dynamically balances fairness and accuracy by leveraging item lifecycle phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness in interactive recommendation by incorporating item lifecycles, which follow a compressed three-phase pattern in short-video platforms, deviating from classical models.

Method: LHRL framework with PhaseFormer for phase detection using STL decomposition and attention mechanisms, plus a two-level HRL agent with high-level policy for phase-aware fairness constraints and low-level policy for immediate user engagement optimization.

Result: Experiments show LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement on multiple real-world datasets, and integrating lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL models consistently yields performance gains.

Conclusion: The lifecycle-aware approach effectively reconciles long-term equity and short-term utility in interactive recommendation, demonstrating generalizability and practical value.

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

*Zhiyuan Li,Haisheng Yu,Guangchuan Guo,Nan Zhou,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MuISQA benchmark for evaluating multi-intent scientific QA and proposes an intent-aware retrieval framework using LLMs to decompose questions, retrieve evidence for each intent, and aggregate results via RRF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG systems are single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage for complex scientific questions that require multi-hop reasoning across diverse sources.

Method: Propose intent-aware retrieval framework: use LLMs to hypothesize answers, decompose into intent-specific queries, retrieve supporting passages per intent, then aggregate and re-rank via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

Result: Experiments on MuISQA benchmark and general RAG datasets show consistent outperformance over conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Conclusion: The intent-aware retrieval framework effectively addresses multi-intent scientific questions by improving evidence coverage across diverse sub-questions while reducing redundancy.

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how multiple organizations can cooperate securely via distributed multi-agent systems while maintaining data privacy and operational boundaries, without requiring shared identifiers or centralized data exchange.

Method: Uses Orpius platform for multi-agent orchestration with OperationRelay calls for natural-language communication. Agents (Clinic, Insurer, Specialist Network) operate on local data with HMAC-based pseudonymous tokens, coverage rule evaluation, and appropriateness recommendations while keeping patient identity protected.

Result: Successfully demonstrated feasibility of distributed agent communication through functional prototype showing secure cooperation between organizations with privacy-preserving pseudonymisation and local data handling.

Conclusion: The work highlights architectural patterns for distributed reasoning among specialized agents while maintaining data locality, and outlines opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralized multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: Proposes an agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models generated by LLMs, extending software testing techniques to optimization modeling with multiple agents handling test API generation, test creation, and mutation testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of validating that optimization models generated from natural language descriptions are correct and meet requirements, as current methods lack systematic validation approaches.

Method: Uses an ensemble of agents that: 1) generate a problem-level testing API, 2) create tests using this API, and 3) perform mutation testing specific to optimization models to assess test suite effectiveness.

Result: The framework demonstrates high-quality validation through experiments measuring mutation coverage, a standard software testing metric.

Conclusion: The proposed agent-based validation framework effectively addresses the validation challenge for LLM-generated optimization models by adapting software testing methods, showing strong performance in mutation coverage assessment.

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CorrectHDL is a framework that uses HLS results as functional references to correct errors in LLM-generated HDL designs, improving area and power efficiency while maintaining functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show potential in hardware design but suffer from hallucination that introduces functional errors in generated HDL designs, requiring a method to ensure correctness while leveraging LLM capabilities.

Method: Uses C/C++ program as input, generates HDL via LLM, repairs syntax errors with RAG, then iteratively improves functional correctness by comparing simulated behavior with HLS reference design from conventional tools.

Result: Generated circuits achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach human-engineered circuit quality while maintaining functional correctness.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines LLM generative capabilities with traditional correctness-driven IC design flows, demonstrating the potential of agentic HDL design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bauplan, an agent-first lakehouse design that addresses trust issues in agentic workflows by implementing data and compute isolation through transactional infrastructure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current enterprises don't trust AI agents with production data due to infrastructure limitations - traditional lakehouses aren't suitable for agent access patterns, and solving the infrastructure problem enables governance.

Method: Proposes Bauplan, an agent-first lakehouse design that reimplements data and compute isolation, drawing operational analogies to MVCC in databases but adapted for decoupled, multi-language settings.

Result: Developed a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan that seamlessly couples agent reasoning with guarantees for correctness and trust.

Conclusion: The path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first - designing lakehouses around transactions enables governance to follow naturally.

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Pharos-ESG is a unified framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations using multimodal parsing, contextual narration, and hierarchical labeling to address challenges in understanding chaotic layouts and implicit hierarchies in ESG reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding due to chaotic reading order from irregular layouts and implicit hierarchies from lengthy, weakly structured content, which hinders effective ESG integration in financial governance.

Method: The framework integrates reading-order modeling based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware segmentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and multimodal aggregation pipeline that transforms visual elements into coherent natural language, enriched with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels.

Result: Extensive experiments show Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. The authors also release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG reports spanning multiple markets.

Conclusion: Pharos-ESG effectively addresses the challenges of ESG report understanding and provides structured representations aligned with financial research demands, while the Aurora-ESG dataset supports better ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

TL;DR: The paper argues that neuroscience should study generative AI principles and ML characterizations of neural systems, discussing five examples where ML research could inform neuroscience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between advances in generative AI/machine learning and neuroscience by investigating which generative principles and ML characterizations might be operative in the brain.

Method: The authors propose examining five specific examples from ML research: shortcomings of world modeling, generation of thought processes, attention mechanisms, neural scaling laws, and quantization techniques.

Result: The paper identifies concrete areas where neuroscience could learn from ML research, suggesting that generative principles and ML characterizations could provide insights into brain function.

Conclusion: Neuroscience should actively investigate generative AI principles and ML research findings as they may reveal fundamental aspects of neural information processing in the brain.

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

### [182] [PersonaDrift: A Benchmark for Temporal Anomaly Detection in Language-Based Dementia Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16445)
*Joy Lai,Alex Mihailidis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDrift is a synthetic benchmark for evaluating methods to detect progressive communication changes in dementia patients, simulating 60-day interaction logs with caregiver-informed personas and testing detection of flattened sentiment and semantic drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current computational tools don't effectively track gradual communication changes in dementia patients, which caregivers notice informally but lack systematic ways to monitor.

Method: Created synthetic 60-day interaction logs based on caregiver interviews, simulating users with diverse communication styles. Injected progressive changes (flattened sentiment and semantic drift) at different rates. Evaluated anomaly detection methods, statistical models, sequence models, and classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings.

Result: Flattened sentiment can be detected with simple statistical models in low-variability users, while semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones across both tasks.

Conclusion: Individual behavioral context is crucial for detecting communication changes in dementia patients, with personalized approaches showing superior performance over generalized methods for tracking progressive behavioral drift.

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

### [183] [Utilizing Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Medical Ontology Extension from Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16548)
*Guanchen Wu,Yuzhang Xie,Huanwei Wu,Zhe He,Hui Shao,Xiao Hu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLOZE is a zero-shot framework that uses large language models to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies, providing accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain valuable medical insights but are underutilized for ontology extension. There's a gap in directly leveraging clinical notes for enhancing medical ontologies.

Method: Uses pre-trained LLMs to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical ontologies in a zero-shot manner without additional training or labeled data, with automated PHI removal for privacy.

Result: Experimental results show CLOZE provides accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework.

Conclusion: CLOZE has strong potential to support downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics by effectively extending medical ontologies using clinical notes.

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

### [184] [Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence? A Framework for Classifying Objections and Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16582)
*Andres Campero,Derek Shiller,Jaan Aru,Jonathan Simon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to digital AI consciousness, categorizing them by granularity level (Marr's levels) and degree of force (from challenges to computational functionalism to claims of strict impossibility).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide structure and tools for disambiguating between different types of challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital AI systems, addressing confusion in the scientific and philosophical literature.

Method: Developed a framework that identifies challenge granularity using Marr's levels and categorizes challenge force into three degrees: challenges to computational functionalism (degree 1), practical improbability claims (degree 2), and strict impossibility arguments (degree 3). Applied this framework to 14 prominent examples from literature.

Result: Created a systematic classification system that helps distinguish between challenges to computational functionalism versus challenges to digital consciousness specifically, and between different ways of interpreting such challenges.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable structure for the debate about AI consciousness by clarifying the nature and force of different arguments, without taking sides in the debate itself.

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

### [185] [Formal Abductive Latent Explanations for Prototype-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16588)
*Jules Soria,Zakaria Chihani,Julien Girard-Satabin,Alban Grastien,Romain Xu-Darme,Daniela Cancila*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs) to address misleading explanations in case-based reasoning networks by providing formal guarantees about predictions through sufficient conditions on latent representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Case-based reasoning models provide explanations by pointing to prototypes, but these explanations can be misleading as different instances with the same explanation may lead to different predictions, which is problematic for safety-critical applications.

Method: The authors propose ALEs, a formalism combining case-based reasoning interpretability with formal XAI guarantees. They develop a solver-free, scalable algorithm using three distinct paradigms to generate sufficient conditions on latent representations that imply predictions.

Result: The approach was validated on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: ALEs successfully bridge the gap between inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and formal guarantees from XAI, providing more reliable explanations for safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: YOFO is a template-conditioned method that enables multimodal large language models to judge all requirements in a single forward pass, achieving significant speed improvements while maintaining interpretability and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM judging approaches face a trade-off between single-score outputs that limit fine-grained requirement understanding and autoregressive generation that is too slow for high-throughput settings.

Method: YOFO uses a template-conditioned approach where an autoregressive model accepts structured requirement templates and produces binary yes/no decisions for each requirement in a single forward pass by reading the logits of final tokens.

Result: YOFO achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups, state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, and supports dependency-aware analysis and post-hoc chain-of-thought reasoning.

Conclusion: YOFO effectively resolves the speed-accuracy trade-off in MLLM judging by enabling efficient single-pass requirement verification while preserving interpretability and advanced analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

TL;DR: DPPO is a metacognitive training framework that alternates between supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to maximize learning efficiency from sparse data, achieving significant performance improvements in embodied AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the embodied data bottleneck (scarce real-world data) and algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods that are resource-prohibitive for developing universal embodied intelligence systems.

Method: Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO) - a metacognitive "Metaloop" framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement) to enable automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation.

Result: Training a vision-language embodied model (Pelican-VL 1.0) with DPPO achieved 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpassed open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%.

Conclusion: DPPO provides the first systematic framework that alleviates data and resource bottlenecks, enabling efficient development of versatile embodied agents, with models and code being open-sourced to benefit the community.

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

TL;DR: MedBayes-Lite is a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for clinical transformers that adds uncertainty quantification without retraining, improving calibration and reducing overconfidence by 32-48% while preventing diagnostic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support but remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical for reliable predictions.

Method: Embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without retraining using three components: Bayesian Embedding Calibration with Monte Carlo dropout, Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization.

Result: Consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), reducing overconfidence by 32-48% and preventing up to 41% of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review.

Conclusion: MedBayes-Lite effectively enables reliable uncertainty propagation and improves interpretability in medical AI systems while maintaining lightweight implementation with under 3% parameter overhead.

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes differences between human and LLM reasoning by developing a cognitive taxonomy and evaluation framework. It reveals systematic structural differences in reasoning approaches and proposes test-time guidance that improves model performance by up to 60% on complex problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models fail on simpler variants of problems they can solve, suggesting they use fundamentally different reasoning mechanisms than humans, and to bridge cognitive science with LLM research for developing more principled reasoning models.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements based on cognitive science research, conducted large-scale analysis of 170K reasoning traces from 17 models across text/vision/audio modalities and 54 human think-aloud traces, plus meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers.

Result: Revealed systematic structural differences: humans use hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining. Research community focuses on easily quantifiable behaviors while neglecting meta-cognitive controls that correlate with success. Test-time reasoning guidance improved performance by up to 60% on complex problems.

Conclusion: By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, this work establishes a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle shortcuts, opening new directions for improving model capabilities and testing human cognition theories at scale.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.
