*Weikang Bai,Yongkun Du,Yuchen Su,Yazhen Xie,Zhineng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CMER-Bench for evaluating mathematical expression recognition, creates large-scale datasets MER-17M and CMER-3M for complex expressions, proposes Structured Mathematical Language representation, and develops CMERNet model that outperforms existing methods on complex expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) methods perform well on simple expressions but struggle with complex expressions containing many tokens and multiple lines, mainly due to training datasets being composed primarily of simple samples.

Method: 1) Created CMER-Bench benchmark with three difficulty levels; 2) Built large-scale datasets MER-17M and CMER-3M emphasizing complex expressions; 3) Introduced Structured Mathematical Language representation to model hierarchical and spatial structure; 4) Developed CMERNet model with encoder-decoder architecture trained on CMER-3M.

Result: CMERNet with only 125 million parameters significantly outperforms existing MER models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on CMER-Bench, especially on complex mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the challenge of complex mathematical expression recognition through comprehensive benchmarking, large-scale datasets, novel representation, and a specialized model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex expressions.

Abstract: Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) has made significant progress in recognizing simple expressions, but the robust recognition of complex mathematical expressions with many tokens and multiple lines remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M. Experimental results show that CMERNet, with only 125 million parameters, significantly outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench.

*Yajie Yang,Yuqing Zhao,Xiaochao Xi,Yinan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses challenges in AI-generated content for journalism by developing a controllable image production pipeline with human oversight, focusing on semantic fidelity, cultural accuracy, and ethical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC in journalism faces issues with misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability due to opaque "black box" systems, creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas that need to be addressed.

Method: Two experiments: (1) Testing cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes; (2) Building a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), with CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials.

Result: Experiment 1 revealed disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. Experiment 2 successfully created a traceable deployment system that preserves semantic representation.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC-assisted image production in special coverage and recommends evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) assisting image production triggers controversy in journalism while attracting attention from media agencies. Key issues involve misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability. Most AIGC tools are opaque "black boxes," hindering the dual demands of content accuracy and semantic alignment and creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas. This paper explores pathways for controllable image production in journalism's special coverage and conducts two experiments with projects from China's media agency: (1) Experiment 1 tests cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes, revealing disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. (2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials. Traceable deployment preserves semantic representation. Consequently, we propose a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC assisted image production in special coverage and recommend evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual localization methods suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and dependency on fiducials or loop closure. Need for accurate, drift-free camera localization for robotics and XR applications.

Method: Uses pre-captured colored LiDAR point cloud, renders synthetic views to establish 2D-3D correspondences with live frames.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables real-time, accurate camera localization without drift or scale ambiguity, suitable for robotics and XR applications by leveraging neural rendering to bridge synthetic-real image domain gap.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework combining MobileCoAtNet for endoscopic image classification with LLMs for clinical reasoning shows improved explanations but reveals LLMs' instability and unreliability for high-stakes medical decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a gap between medical image classifiers that don't explain decisions and LLMs that generate clinical text but struggle with visual reasoning and produce unstable explanations, creating a disconnect between model outputs and clinician expectations.

Method: Developed a hybrid framework linking image classification with structured clinical reasoning using MobileCoAtNet for endoscopic image classification across 8 stomach-related classes, then using its outputs to drive reasoning by 32 LLMs evaluated against expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care.

Result: Strong classification improves LLM explanation quality, but no models reach human-level stability - even the best LLMs change reasoning with prompt variations, showing current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions despite useful clinical narrative generation.

Conclusion: Combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs are unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions; the framework provides clearer view of LLM limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

Abstract: Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

### [5] [An evaluation of SVBRDF Prediction from Generative Image Models for Appearance Modeling of 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13950)
*Alban Gauthier,Valentin Deschaintre,Alexandre Lanvin,Fredo Durand,Adrien Bousseau,George Drettakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes SVBRDF prediction methods for fast appearance modeling pipelines using generated RGB images, comparing neural architectures to achieve high accuracy and multiview coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With deep generative models enabling realistic RGB image synthesis from 3D scenes and SVBRDF prediction networks recovering material parameters, there's an opportunity to create fast appearance modeling pipelines. However, single-view SVBRDF predictions may suffer from multiview incoherence, while generated RGB images can provide additional information for better estimation.

Method: The paper compares neural architectures and conditioning strategies for SVBRDF prediction in the context of generated RGB images. The researchers analyze different network designs and conditions to identify optimal approaches for achieving both high accuracy and multiview coherence in texture atlas generation.

Result: The study finds that surprisingly, a standard UNet architecture is competitive with more complex designs for SVBRDF prediction in this pipeline, suggesting that simpler architectures can perform well when properly integrated with generated RGB image data.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into effective SVBRDF prediction methods for fast appearance modeling pipelines, demonstrating that simpler neural architectures can achieve competitive performance when leveraging generated RGB images and appropriate conditioning strategies.

Abstract: Digital content creation is experiencing a profound change with the advent of deep generative models. For texturing, conditional image generators now allow the synthesis of realistic RGB images of a 3D scene that align with the geometry of that scene. For appearance modeling, SVBRDF prediction networks recover material parameters from RGB images. Combining these technologies allows us to quickly generate SVBRDF maps for multiple views of a 3D scene, which can be merged to form a SVBRDF texture atlas of that scene. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities for SVBRDF prediction in the context of such a fast appearance modeling pipeline. On the one hand, single-view SVBRDF predictions might suffer from multiview incoherence and yield inconsistent texture atlases. On the other hand, generated RGB images, and the different modalities on which they are conditioned, can provide additional information for SVBRDF estimation compared to photographs. We compare neural architectures and conditions to identify designs that achieve high accuracy and coherence. We find that, surprisingly, a standard UNet is competitive with more complex designs.

### [6] [Why Text Prevails: Vision May Undermine Multimodal Medical Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13747)
*Siyuan Dai,Lunxiao Li,Kun Zhao,Eardi Lila,Paul K. Crane,Heng Huang,Dongkuan Xu,Haoteng Tang,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with medical decision-making tasks, performing worse than text-only approaches, revealing limitations in visual understanding that need addressing through specialized strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite impressive zero-shot capabilities of multimodal LLMs in general vision-language tasks, they perform poorly on basic medical decision-making tasks, particularly with subtle visual differences in medical imaging like Alzheimer's disease classification and chest radiograph analysis.

Method: The study investigates MLLM limitations using two challenging biomedical datasets: three-stage Alzheimer's disease classification and MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification. It compares text-only, vision-only, and multimodal approaches, then explores three improvement strategies: in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision.

Result: Text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or multimodal settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. This reveals that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding for medical decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: Current multimodal LLMs have significant limitations in medical visual understanding, pointing to the need for specialized approaches like the three explored strategies to improve multimodal decision making in healthcare applications.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities on vision-language tasks. In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldPlay is a streaming video diffusion model that achieves real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency at 24 FPS for 720p video, overcoming speed-memory trade-offs through dual action representation, reconstituted context memory, and context forcing distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for streaming video generation face a fundamental trade-off between speed and memory, limiting their ability to maintain long-term geometric consistency in real-time interactive applications. This paper aims to resolve this limitation to enable robust, consistent world modeling that responds to user inputs.

Method: WorldPlay introduces three key innovations: 1) Dual Action Representation for robust user input control, 2) Reconstituted Context Memory that dynamically rebuilds context from past frames using temporal reframing to maintain access to geometrically important frames, and 3) Context Forcing distillation that aligns memory context between teacher and student models to preserve long-range information while enabling real-time speeds.

Result: WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior geometric consistency compared to existing techniques. The model shows strong generalization across diverse scenes and maintains interactive responsiveness to keyboard and mouse inputs.

Conclusion: WorldPlay successfully resolves the speed-memory trade-off in streaming video diffusion models, enabling real-time interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency. The combination of dual action representation, reconstituted context memory, and context forcing distillation provides a comprehensive solution for high-quality, consistent video generation at interactive speeds.

Abstract: This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

*Jie Qin,Jiancheng Huang,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAR introduces a stacked autoregressive scheme for unified multimodal learning, decomposing tasks into understanding, generation, and editing stages to avoid cross-task interference while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models face challenges in achieving unified targets for both understanding and generation due to optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs. There's a need to enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities.

Method: STAR decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages (understanding, generation, editing) using a stacked autoregressive scheme. It freezes the fundamental AR model parameters and progressively stacks isomorphic AR modules to avoid cross-task interference. Additionally, it introduces a high-capacity VQ to enhance image representation granularity and employs implicit reasoning mechanisms for better generation under complex conditions.

Result: STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), demonstrating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.

Conclusion: The STAR framework successfully addresses the challenge of unified multimodal understanding and generation by avoiding optimization conflicts through task-progressive learning, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks while preserving comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) play a pivotal role in advancing the quest for general artificial intelligence. However, achieving unified target for multimodal understanding and generation remains challenging due to optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs. To effectively enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities, we introduce STAR: a STacked AutoRegressive scheme for task-progressive unified multimodal learning. This approach decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages: understanding, generation, and editing. By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.

*Mika Sipilä,Sabrina Maggio,Sandra De Iaco,Klaus Nordhausen,Monica Palma,Sara Taskinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (SRDRN and UNet) with temporal modules improve spatial downscaling of satellite ozone data over Italy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite atmospheric pollutant data is often too coarse for local-scale analysis, creating a need for effective spatial downscaling methods.

Method: Extended SRDRN and UNet architectures with lightweight temporal modules using sinusoidal or RBF encoding to fuse temporal features with spatial representations.

Result: Temporal modules significantly improve downscaling performance and convergence speed with only slight computational complexity increase.

Conclusion: Time-aware deep learning extensions enhance spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone data, making satellite observations more useful for local environmental analysis.

Abstract: Satellite data of atmospheric pollutants are often available only at coarse spatial resolution, limiting their applicability in local-scale environmental analysis and decision-making. Spatial downscaling methods aim to transform the coarse satellite data into high-resolution fields. In this work, two widely used deep learning architectures, the super-resolution deep residual network (SRDRN) and the encoder-decoder-based UNet, are considered for spatial downscaling of tropospheric ozone. Both methods are extended with a lightweight temporal module, which encodes observation time using either sinusoidal or radial basis function (RBF) encoding, and fuses the temporal features with the spatial representations in the networks. The proposed time-aware extensions are evaluated against their baseline counterparts in a case study on ozone downscaling over Italy. The results suggest that, while only slightly increasing computational complexity, the temporal modules significantly improve downscaling performance and convergence speed.

*Victor Rong,Jan Held,Victor Chu,Daniel Rebain,Marc Van Droogenbroeck,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Surfel-based representation decouples geometry and appearance, using surfels for geometry and neural field + per-primitive colors for appearance, achieving compact representation with fewer primitives and less memory than Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian splatting requires millions of primitives even for simple geometry scenes, leading to inefficient representation. The authors aim to create a more compact representation by separating geometry and appearance modeling.

Method: Uses surfels for geometry representation and combines a global neural field with per-primitive colors for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives per pixel to keep computational cost low.

Result: Achieves 9.7× fewer primitives and 5.5× less memory on outdoor scenes, and 31× fewer primitives and 3.7× less memory on indoor scenes compared to 3D Gaussian splatting, while matching perceptual quality. Renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives with better visual quality.

Conclusion: The proposed surfel-based representation with decoupled geometry and appearance provides a more compact and efficient alternative to Gaussian splatting, achieving similar visual quality with significantly fewer primitives and memory usage.

Abstract: Though Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, it requires millions of primitives to model highly textured scenes, even when the geometry of the scene is simple. We propose a representation that goes beyond point-based rendering and decouples geometry and appearance in order to achieve a compact representation. We use surfels for geometry and a combination of a global neural field and per-primitive colours for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives for each pixel, ensuring that the added compute is low. Our representation matches the perceptual quality of 3D Gaussian splatting while using $9.7\times$ fewer primitives and $5.5\times$ less memory on outdoor scenes and using $31\times$ fewer primitives and $3.7\times$ less memory on indoor scenes. Our representation also renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives while improving upon their visual quality.

*Yannan He,Garvita Tiwari,Xiaohan Zhang,Pankaj Bora,Tolga Birdal,Jan Eric Lenssen,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoLingo is a text-to-motion model that generates realistic human motion using diffusion in a continuous latent space with semantic alignment and cross-attention text conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve text-to-motion generation by addressing two key challenges: creating a semantically aligned latent space for more effective diffusion, and finding optimal text conditioning methods for better motion-description alignment.

Method: Uses a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels to create a diffusion-friendly latent space. Compares single-token vs multi-token cross-attention for text conditioning, finding cross-attention superior. Employs auto-regressive generation over multiple latents.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in human motion generation on standard metrics and user studies, achieving better motion realism and text-motion alignment.

Conclusion: Semantically aligned latents combined with cross-attention text conditioning and auto-regressive generation significantly improve text-to-motion generation quality and realism.

Abstract: We introduce MoLingo, a text-to-motion (T2M) model that generates realistic, lifelike human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space. Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.

### [13] [Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment for UAV-based Human Detection using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13869)
*Wenda Li,Meng Wu,Sungmin Eum,Heesung Kwon,Qing Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFHA is a three-stage diffusion framework that transforms synthetic UAV images to reduce domain gap with real data while preserving labels, improving human detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV-based human detection faces challenges due to shifting target distributions and lack of labeled real images. Synthetic data helps but suffers from domain gap issues that hinder real-world application.

Method: Three-stage hierarchical alignment: (1) Global Style Transfer using diffusion to align color/illumination/texture, (2) Local Refinement with super-resolution diffusion for fine-grained details of small objects, (3) Hallucination Removal to filter unrealistic human instances.

Result: Significant improvement in detection accuracy on UAV Sim2Real benchmarks, achieving up to +14.1 mAP50 improvement on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm complementary roles of global and local stages.

Conclusion: CFHA effectively bridges synthetic-to-real domain gap for UAV human detection through hierarchical alignment, enabling better utilization of synthetic data while preserving original annotations.

Abstract: Training object detectors demands extensive, task-specific annotations, yet this requirement becomes impractical in UAV-based human detection due to constantly shifting target distributions and the scarcity of labeled images. As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the global and local stages and highlight the importance of hierarchical alignment. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/liwd190019/CFHA}{this url}.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning models inefficiently process all frames at once like watching entire videos, unlike humans who reason flexibly across different durations. The paper aims to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems inspired by human behavior.

Method: 1) Propose SAGE agent system for multi-turn reasoning on long videos; 2) Introduce synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train SAGE-MM orchestrator; 3) Develop RL post-training recipe for any-horizon reasoning; 4) Curate SAGE-Bench with 700+ second videos for evaluation.

Result: SAGE achieves up to 6.1% improvement on open-ended video reasoning tasks and 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes, demonstrating effective any-horizon reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a performant any-horizon video reasoning system that mimics human flexible reasoning, showing significant improvements on long video tasks through multi-turn reasoning, synthetic data training, and RL post-training.

Abstract: As humans, we are natural any-horizon reasoners, i.e., we can decide whether to iteratively skim long videos or watch short ones in full when necessary for a given task. With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.

*Ye Zhang,Qi Chen,Wenyou Huang,Rui Liu,Zhengjian Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Route-DETR improves DETR by addressing inefficient query competition through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention, distinguishing competing vs complementary queries to reduce redundancy and improve detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations and suboptimal performance. The paper aims to solve this fundamental limitation of DETR architectures.

Method: Route-DETR introduces adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. It employs dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference.

Result: Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Route-DETR effectively addresses the query competition problem in DETR through adaptive pairwise routing, achieving significant performance improvements without additional computational cost during inference, making it a practical enhancement for DETR-based object detection systems.

Abstract: Detection Transformer (DETR) offers an end-to-end solution for object detection by eliminating hand-crafted components like non-maximum suppression. However, DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations. We present Route-DETR, which addresses these issues through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers. Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Real-time deployment of prostate MRI segmentation on clinical workstations is often bottlenecked by computational load and memory footprint. Deep learning-based prostate gland segmentation approaches remain challenging due to anatomical variability. To bridge this efficiency gap while still maintaining reliable segmentation accuracy, we propose KLO-Net, a dynamic K-Nearest Neighbor attention U-Net with Cross Stage Partial, i.e., CSP, encoder for efficient prostate gland segmentation from MRI scan. Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice. In addition, CSP blocks address the computational load to reduce memory consumption. To evaluate the model's performance, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx, to validate the proposed architecture. The detailed comparative analysis demonstrates the model's advantage in computational efficiency and segmentation quality.

### [17] [From Unlearning to UNBRANDING: A Benchmark for Trademark-Safe Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13953)
*Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Filip Manjak,Maciej Zięba,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces "unbranding" as a novel task for fine-grained removal of both explicit trademarks and subtle structural brand features from AI-generated images while preserving semantic coherence, and proposes a VLM-based evaluation metric to address limitations of existing brand detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement of text-to-image diffusion models raises concerns about unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content. Existing methods focus on general concepts but fail to address specific brand identifiers, particularly the multi-dimensional nature of brand recognition that includes both explicit logos and subtle structural features (trade dress).

Method: The paper introduces the "unbranding" task and constructs a comprehensive benchmark dataset. It proposes a novel evaluation metric using Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a question-answering framework to detect both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics, addressing limitations of existing brand detectors.

Result: The study finds that newer text-to-image models (SDXL, FLUX) synthesize brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), highlighting the urgency of the unbranding challenge. Results validated by the VLM metric confirm that unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques.

Conclusion: Unbranding represents a novel and important task for removing both explicit trademarks and subtle structural brand features from AI-generated content. The proposed VLM-based evaluation metric effectively addresses the limitations of existing brand detectors, and the increasing fidelity of text-to-image models makes this problem increasingly urgent and relevant.

Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image diffusion models raises significant concerns regarding the unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content. While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques. Project Page: https://gmum.github.io/UNBRANDING/.

*Miaohua Zhang,Mohammad Ali Armin,Xuesong Li,Sisi Liang,Lars Petersson,Changming Sun,David Ahmedt-Aristizabal,Zeeshan Hayder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating diverse synthetic training data for marine obstacle segmentation using class-aware prompts and adaptive conditioning perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marine obstacle detection faces challenges from environmental conditions (sun glitter, fog, waves) that degrade image quality, combined with limited and repetitive marine datasets. Existing mask-conditioned diffusion models produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on simple masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving segmentation robustness.

Method: A quality-driven, diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline with two key components: (1) class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (2) adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, regulated by a COD-guided proportional controller to balance diversity and layout fidelity.

Result: The pipeline generates training data at inference time without retraining the diffusion model. When used to augment training data for marine obstacle segmentation, it consistently improves performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the data scarcity and diversity limitations in marine obstacle detection by generating controlled synthetic samples that enhance segmentation robustness without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Marine obstacle detection demands robust segmentation under challenging conditions, such as sun glitter, fog, and rapidly changing wave patterns. These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity. Across marine obstacle benchmarks, augmenting training data with these controlled synthetic samples consistently improves segmentation performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.

TL;DR: FocalComm is a collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features to improve pedestrian detection in autonomous driving, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collaborative perception approaches optimize for vehicle detection metrics and underperform on smaller, safety-critical objects like pedestrians. They also rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives.

Method: FocalComm features two novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration.

Result: FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X datasets across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric setups, with strong performance gains in pedestrian detection on V2X-Real.

Conclusion: FocalComm demonstrates that focusing on hard-instance-oriented feature exchange improves collaborative perception, particularly for safety-critical pedestrian detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) is a promising paradigm for improving autonomous driving safety, particularly for vulnerable road users like pedestrians, via robust 3D perception. However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups. FocalComm also shows a strong performance gain in pedestrian detection in V2X-Real.

Conclusion: The unified 2D formulation facilitates learning from limited 3D data and produces practical, high-quality 3D shape completions using adapted 2D diffusion models.

Abstract: We present a framework that adapts 2D diffusion models for 3D shape completion from incomplete point clouds. While text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success with abundant 2D data, 3D diffusion models lag due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and a persistent modality gap between 3D inputs and 2D latent spaces. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Shape Atlas, a compact 2D representation of 3D geometry that (1) enables full utilization of the generative power of pretrained 2D diffusion models, and (2) aligns the modalities between the conditional input and output spaces, allowing more effective conditioning. This unified 2D formulation facilitates learning from limited 3D data and produces high-quality, detail-preserving shape completions. We validate the effectiveness of our results on the PCN and ShapeNet-55 datasets. Additionally, we show the downstream application of creating artist-created meshes from our completed point clouds, further demonstrating the practicality of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have strong multimodal performance but suffer from slow inference due to repeatedly processing redundant masked tokens at every sampling step.

Method: Proposes Sparse-LaViDa framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step, introduces register tokens as compact representations for truncated tokens, and designs specialized attention masks to match truncated sampling during training.

Result: Built on LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: Sparse-LaViDa effectively accelerates MDM inference through dynamic token truncation with register tokens and specialized training, achieving significant speed improvements without quality degradation.

Abstract: Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy, lacking direct evaluation of sampling strategies. There's a need for a benchmark that enables direct analysis of how different sampling approaches capture essential content across entire long videos.

Method: 1) Create KFS-Bench with multi-scene annotations providing ground-truth of multiple disjoint scenes required per question; 2) Conduct comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods; 3) Design novel sampling quality metric correlating with QA accuracy; 4) Develop novel key frame sampling method leveraging question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity.

Result: Identified that sampling precision, scene coverage, and sampling balance are key factors influencing QA performance. The adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance.

Conclusion: KFS-Bench enables direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies for long video QA. The proposed sampling method and quality metric effectively improve coverage of relevant scenes and correlate with QA accuracy, advancing efficient long-form video understanding.

Abstract: We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.

Motivation: Existing SSL methods for medical image-tabular data are limited to specific cohorts due to rigid tabular modeling mechanisms, creating an inter-tabular barrier that prevents learning transferable medical knowledge across diverse datasets.

Method: CITab integrates column headers as semantic cues for tabular modeling, enabling cross-tabular knowledge transfer. It also introduces a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization to handle data heterogeneity and explore underlying medical concepts.

Result: CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects, demonstrating superior performance in cross-tabular multi-modal learning.

Conclusion: CITab provides an effective and scalable framework for cross-tabular multi-modal learning in medical applications, overcoming limitations of existing SSL methods and enabling better utilization of diverse data sources for pretraining.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning integrating medical images and tabular data has significantly advanced clinical decision-making in recent years. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for effective and scalable cross-tabular multi-modal learning.

TL;DR: A learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs correspondence matching in feature space rather than pixel domain, achieving robust 3D imaging with improved performance over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional structured light methods decode depth through pixel-domain matching, which has limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. There's a need for more robust decoding approaches.

Method: Proposes a learning-based structured light decoding framework that extracts neural features from projected patterns and captured IR images, builds cost volumes in feature space, and includes a depth refinement module leveraging priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models.

Result: The method, trained exclusively on synthetic data, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, processes various pattern types without retraining, and outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

Conclusion: Feature-space matching in structured light systems provides substantial performance improvements over traditional pixel-domain approaches, enabling robust 3D imaging that handles challenging scenarios effectively.

Abstract: We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

Motivation: To create a neural implicit SLAM system that operates in real-time with efficient 3D map representation, fast relocalization, and privacy preservation, addressing limitations of existing neural SLAM approaches.

Method: Uses Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as core implicit map representation, where a lightweight network maps 2D image features directly to 3D global coordinates.

Conclusion: SCR-based representation enables the first real-time neural implicit RGB-D SLAM system with efficient mapping, fast relocalization, privacy preservation, and reliable operation in dynamic environments, offering a simple yet flexible framework.

Abstract: We present a novel neural RGB-D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system that learns an implicit map of the scene in real time. For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.
  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation.

*Meng Wei,Cheng Zhang,Jianmin Zheng,Hamid Rezatofighi,Jianfei Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASAP Textured Gaussians improves memory efficiency in 3D Gaussian Splatting by using adaptive sampling based on Gaussian density and error-driven anisotropic texture parameterization, achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer texture parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing textured Gaussian methods have memory efficiency challenges due to two key limitations: (1) textures defined in canonical space lead to inefficient sampling that wastes capacity on low-contribution regions, and (2) uniform texture parameterization across all Gaussians results in over-parameterization regardless of visual complexity.

Method: Two strategies: (1) adaptive sampling based on Gaussian density distribution to focus texture resources on important regions, and (2) error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error, with more parameters for complex regions and fewer for simple ones.

Result: ASAP Textured Gaussians significantly improve the quality-efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive sampling and anisotropic parameterization strategies effectively address memory efficiency challenges in textured Gaussian methods while maintaining high rendering quality, offering a better quality-efficiency balance.

Abstract: Recent advances have equipped 3D Gaussian Splatting with texture parameterizations to capture spatially varying attributes, improving the performance of both appearance modeling and downstream tasks. However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.

*Boran Wang,Xinming Wang,Yi Chen,Xiang Li,Jian Xu,Jing Yuan,Chenglin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartAgent is a chart understanding framework using Tool-Integrated Reasoning that decomposes analysis into observable steps with modular tools, improving robustness when key numerals are absent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs for chart understanding heavily depend on explicit textual annotations and degrade when key numerals are missing, creating a need for more robust systems.

Method: Uses Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) to decompose chart analysis into observable steps, supported by an extensible modular tool library with core tools like key element detection, instance segmentation, and OCR.

Result: ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings and provides traceable, reproducible support for conclusions through structured Evidence Packages.

Conclusion: ChartAgent offers a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible chart understanding systems by moving beyond black-box paradigms with transparent, verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: With their high information density and intuitive readability, charts have become the de facto medium for data analysis and communication across disciplines. Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.

*Zhenguo Zhang,Haohan Zhen,Yishen Wang,Le Xu,Tianchen Deng,Xuefeng Chen,Qu Chen,Bo Zhang,Wuxiong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniDrive-R1 is an end-to-end VLM framework for autonomous driving that addresses object hallucination through interleaved multimodal Chain-of-Thought reasoning and reinforcement-driven visual grounding, achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models in autonomous driving suffer from reliability failures like object hallucination due to ungrounded text-based reasoning. Existing multimodal CoT approaches have flaws: decoupled perception/reasoning stages preventing joint optimization, and reliance on expensive dense localization labels.

Method: Introduces OmniDrive-R1 with interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism that unifies perception and reasoning. Core innovation is reinforcement-driven visual grounding that enables autonomous attention focusing on critical regions. Uses pure two-stage reinforcement learning pipeline with Clip-GRPO algorithm featuring annotation-free, process-based grounding reward.

Result: Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 show significant improvements: overall reasoning score improved from 51.77% to 80.35%, and final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62% compared to baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B.

Conclusion: OmniDrive-R1 effectively addresses object hallucination in VLMs for autonomous driving through end-to-end joint optimization and reinforcement-driven visual grounding, eliminating need for dense labels while improving reasoning accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and "zoom in" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.

Conclusion: SELECT is the first method to successfully detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets while accounting for variable-length labels, demonstrating practical utility for improving dataset quality and STR performance.

Abstract: We introduce SELECT (Scene tExt Label Errors deteCTion), a novel approach that leverages multi-modal training to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets. Utilizing an image-text encoder and a character-level tokenizer, SELECT addresses the issues of variable-length sequence labels, label sequence misalignment, and character-level errors, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and practical utility. In addition, we introduce Similarity-based Sequence Label Corruption (SSLC), a process that intentionally introduces errors into the training labels to mimic real-world error scenarios during training. SSLC not only can cause a change in the sequence length but also takes into account the visual similarity between characters during corruption. Our method is the first to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets successfully accounting for variable-length labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SELECT in detecting label errors and improving STR accuracy on real-world text datasets, showcasing its practical utility.

Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs have strong capabilities but high computational/memory requirements that prevent on-device deployment. Standard ViT encoders are particularly problematic for high-resolution inputs, causing excessive latency and memory consumption.

Method: 1) Image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage; 2) Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation; 3) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL) that aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework for dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices.

Conclusion: HyperVL demonstrates practicality for on-device multimodal inference by addressing the critical bottlenecks of memory and latency while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Current multimodal large lanauge models possess strong perceptual and reasoning capabilities, however high computational and memory requirements make them difficult to deploy directly on on-device environments. While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FacEDiT proposes speech-conditional facial motion infilling as a unifying framework for both talking face editing and generation, using a Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching to enable localized edits while maintaining seamless transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the artificial separation between talking face editing and generation tasks, proposing a unified formulation that can handle both through facial motion infilling. This approach enables more flexible and comprehensive facial animation capabilities.

Method: FacEDiT uses a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching, inspired by masked autoencoders. It learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech, with biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints for boundary continuity and lip synchronization.

Result: The method produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity. It generalizes effectively to talking face generation and outperforms existing approaches on the newly introduced FacEDiTBench dataset.

Conclusion: Talking face editing and generation can be effectively unified under speech-conditional facial motion infilling. FacEDiT demonstrates that this formulation enables both localized edits and full generation while maintaining seamless transitions and accurate lip synchronization.

Abstract: Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Daylight-linked controls have significant energy-saving potential but require accurate real-time indoor illuminance prediction. Most existing methods only work for static scenes, limiting their application in dynamically occupied spaces.

Method: Proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that extracts temporal-spatial features from non-intrusive images, focusing only on side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels to maintain applicability in occupied spaces. Trained on 17,344 samples collected from a field experiment in Guangzhou.

Result: Achieved R² > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on same-distribution test set, and R² > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on unseen-day test set, demonstrating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate real-time indoor illuminance prediction for daylight-linked controls in dynamically occupied spaces, addressing limitations of existing static-scene methods and supporting building energy efficiency.

Abstract: Daylight-linked controls (DLCs) have significant potential for energy savings in buildings, especially when abundant daylight is available and indoor workplane illuminance can be accurately predicted in real time. Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.

*Hao Chen,Junyang Chen,Jinshan Pan,Jiangxin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CODSR is a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution that addresses three key limitations of existing methods through LQ-guided feature modulation, region-adaptive generative prior activation, and text-matching guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent diffusion-based one-step super-resolution methods have three critical limitations: (1) inferior fidelity from compression encoding information loss, (2) insufficient region-discriminative activation of generative priors, and (3) misalignment between text prompts and semantic regions.

Method: CODSR proposes three main components: 1) LQ-guided feature modulation module using original uncompressed LQ information for high-fidelity conditioning, 2) region-adaptive generative prior activation method to enhance perceptual richness while preserving local structure, and 3) text-matching guidance strategy to better utilize text prompt conditioning.

Result: Extensive experiments show CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining efficient one-step inference.

Conclusion: CODSR successfully addresses key limitations of existing diffusion-based one-step super-resolution methods through its three novel components, achieving both high perceptual quality and fidelity with efficient inference.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based one-step methods have shown remarkable progress in the field of image super-resolution, yet they remain constrained by three critical limitations: (1) inferior fidelity performance caused by the information loss from compression encoding of low-quality (LQ) inputs; (2) insufficient region-discriminative activation of generative priors; (3) misalignment between text prompts and their corresponding semantic regions. To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CODSR achieves superior perceptual quality and competitive fidelity compared with state-of-the-art methods with efficient one-step inference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDAR-VL is a block-wise discrete diffusion model for vision-language understanding that addresses training inefficiency and instability issues through an integrated framework with three key components: asynchronous noise scheduling, effective mask ratio scaling, and progressive beta noise curriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Block-wise discrete diffusion offers a good balance between parallel generation and causal dependency modeling for vision-language tasks, but its adoption has been limited by high training costs, slow convergence, and instability compared to autoregressive baselines.

Method: SDAR-VL introduces an integrated framework with three components: 1) Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling to diversify supervision within batches, 2) Effective Mask Ratio Scaling for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking, and 3) Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity.

Result: Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show SDAR-VL improves training efficiency, convergence stability, and task performance over conventional block diffusion. It sets new state-of-the-art among diffusion-based vision-language models and matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines like LLaVA-OneVision and global diffusion baseline LLaDA-V.

Conclusion: SDAR-VL establishes block-wise diffusion as a practical backbone for vision-language understanding by overcoming previous limitations through an efficient and stable training framework that achieves competitive performance with strong baselines.

Abstract: Block-wise discrete diffusion offers an attractive balance between parallel generation and causal dependency modeling, making it a promising backbone for vision-language modeling. However, its practical adoption has been limited by high training cost, slow convergence, and instability, which have so far kept it behind strong autoregressive (AR) baselines. We present \textbf{SDAR-VL}, the first systematic application of block-wise discrete diffusion to large-scale vision-language understanding (VLU), together with an \emph{integrated framework for efficient and stable training}. This framework unifies three components: (1) \textbf{Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling} to diversify supervision within each batch; (2) \textbf{Effective Mask Ratio Scaling} for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking; and (3) a \textbf{Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum} that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity. Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show that SDAR-VL consistently improves \emph{training efficiency}, \emph{convergence stability}, and \emph{task performance} over conventional block diffusion. On this evaluation suite, SDAR-VL sets a new state of the art among diffusion-based vision-language models and, under matched settings, matches or surpasses strong AR baselines such as LLaVA-OneVision as well as the global diffusion baseline LLaDA-V, establishing block-wise diffusion as a practical backbone for VLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaussianPlant: A hierarchical 3DGS method that jointly recovers botanical plant appearance and internal structure from multi-view images using disentangled structure and appearance primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels at appearance reconstruction for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations (like branching patterns) needed for applications such as plant phenotyping.

Method: Introduces GaussianPlant with hierarchical representation: Structure Primitives (StPs) model branches as cylinders and leaves as disks; Appearance Primitives (ApPs) use 3D Gaussians for appearance. StPs self-organize to distinguish branches/leaves, while ApPs are bound to StPs. Joint optimization uses re-rendering loss and gradient flow from ApP to StP via binding correspondence.

Result: Achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling extraction of branch structure and leaf instances from botanical plants.

Conclusion: GaussianPlant successfully disentangles structure and appearance in botanical plant reconstruction, overcoming 3DGS limitations and enabling practical applications like plant phenotyping through accurate structural representation.

Abstract: We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based respiratory rate estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across different extraction methods. There's a need for a robust framework that can dynamically assess signal reliability and adaptively combine multiple signal sources.

Method: Extracts ten signals from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines.

*Sisi Dai,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchorHOI is a novel framework for zero-shot 4D human-object interaction generation that uses anchor-based prior distillation with video diffusion models to overcome dataset limitations and improve interaction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven 4D HOI generation faces scalability issues due to limited datasets, and zero-shot approaches using image diffusion models fail to adequately capture interaction cues, restricting applicability across diverse scenarios.

Method: AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy with two-step process: 1) constructs interaction-aware anchors (anchor NeRFs for composition, anchor keypoints for motion), 2) leverages video diffusion models beyond image models to guide generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization in 4D HOI generation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses challenges in 4D HOI generation by exploiting hybrid priors through anchor-based distillation, enabling more expressive interaction composition and realistic motion synthesis without large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.

### [40] [OUSAC: Optimized Guidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching for DiT Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14096)
*Ruitong Sun,Tianze Yang,Wei Niu,Jin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OUSAC accelerates diffusion transformers by optimizing guidance scheduling and adaptive caching, reducing computation by 53-60% while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive due to iterative denoising, and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) doubles computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional passes at every timestep.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage-1 uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use (eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes). Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block to maintain caching effectiveness under variable guidance.

Result: OUSAC achieves 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

Conclusion: OUSAC provides a systematic optimization framework that significantly accelerates diffusion transformers while maintaining or improving generation quality through optimized guidance scheduling and adaptive caching.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion offers simple yet effective approach for multi-view generation, eliminating need for complex 3D geometric constraints while maintaining architectural simplicity and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.

*Emanuele Mezzi,Gertjan Burghouts,Maarten Kruithof*

TL;DR: RUNE combines LLMs with neurosymbolic AI for explainable text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing, using explicit reasoning over detected entities and FOL expressions instead of implicit joint embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS-LVLMs have limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations, limiting real-world usability. There's a need for more interpretable and robust retrieval systems.

Method: Uses LLMs to translate text queries into First-Order Logic expressions, then performs neurosymbolic reasoning over detected entities in images. Includes logic decomposition for scalability and operates on conditioned entity subsets.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, especially on complex queries. Introduces RRQC and RRIU metrics showing superior robustness to query complexity and image uncertainty. Demonstrates effectiveness in post-flood satellite image retrieval.

Conclusion: RUNE offers significant improvements in performance, robustness, and explainability over joint-embedding models for complex RS retrieval tasks, with practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.

*Ashish Mishra,Gyanaranjan Nayak,Tarun Kumar,Arpit Shah,Suparna Bhattacharya,Martin Foltin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training- and data-free framework for selectively removing specific object classes from CLIP models without retraining, enabling three forgetting paradigms: global, domain-specific, and selective domain unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications often require removing specific object classes from pretrained models like CLIP without additional data or retraining, while maintaining performance on unrelated tasks. Existing retraining-based methods are computationally expensive and inflexible.

Method: Leverages a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space to efficiently remove undesired class information while preserving remaining knowledge.

Result: The method enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, domain-specific knowledge removal, and complete unlearning in selective domains, overcoming limitations of existing retraining-based approaches.

Conclusion: Proposes a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting that works without training data or model retraining, offering practical advantages for real-world applications requiring selective knowledge removal.

Abstract: Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFE-GAN is an efficient GAN framework for document image enhancement and binarization that uses multi-scale feature extraction with Haar wavelet transformation to reduce training/inference times while maintaining SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use multiple independent GANs for different color channels to remove shadows/noise from degraded document images, but this approach results in long training and inference times that need to be reduced.

Method: Proposes MFE-GAN with multi-scale feature extraction using Haar wavelet transformation and normalization to preprocess images before GAN training. Also introduces novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions, with ablation studies to validate design choices.

Result: Experimental results on Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets show MFE-GAN significantly reduces total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFE-GAN provides an efficient solution for document image enhancement and binarization that balances performance with computational efficiency, making it practical for real-world OCR applications.

Abstract: Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The implementation of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/MFE-GAN.

TL;DR: Consistent Instance Field introduces a continuous probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scenes using deformable 3D Gaussians that jointly encode radiance and semantics, enabling consistent instance tracking across time and views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for dynamic scene understanding rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, which struggle with consistent object identity representation across space and time. The authors aim to create a representation that disentangles visibility from persistent object identity.

Method: The method uses deformable 3D Gaussians that jointly encode radiance and semantic information, learned directly from RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. It introduces mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions for consistent instance representations.

Result: Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.

Conclusion: The Consistent Instance Field representation successfully addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent object identity across space and time in dynamic scenes, providing a powerful framework for 4D scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Consistent Instance Field, a continuous and probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scene understanding. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A closed-form selective unlearning method for multimodal models using nullspace projection to erase target class information without retraining or forget set images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional unlearning methods require iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, which is computationally expensive. There's a need for efficient, precise techniques to remove specific knowledge from pretrained models while preserving overall multimodal capabilities.

Method: Leverages nullspace projection to erase target class information embedded in the final projection layer. Computes orthonormal basis for subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projects these directions to reduce alignment between image features and undesired classes.

Result: Dramatically reduces alignment between image features and target classes, leading to pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for target classes while preserving overall multimodal knowledge. Partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information.

Conclusion: The approach is computationally efficient and surgically precise, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation for multimodal models like CLIP without requiring retraining or forget set images.

Abstract: We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing, creating a need for a specialized sketch editing assistant.

Method: 1) Controllable data generation pipeline: constructs attribute-addition sequences, forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, expands stylistic coverage with style-preserving attribute-removal. 2) Unified sketch editing framework: repurposes RGB channels to encode inputs for seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing. 3) Task-guided mixture-of-experts in LoRA layers: routes by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines.

Conclusion: SketchAssist provides a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision, addressing the limitations of existing systems for line art editing while supporting both global semantic changes and precise local redrawing.

Abstract: Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.

Motivation: Identifying performance anti-patterns in ML models requires deep expertise and is resource-intensive, making it inaccessible to most computer vision researchers. Current methods struggle to pinpoint problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces.

Method: Created benchmark dataset with 600+ PyTorch traces from diverse CV models across multiple hardware platforms. Proposed iterative approach: lightweight ML model detects trace segments with anti-patterns, followed by LLM for fine-grained classification and targeted feedback.

Result: Method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule-based statistical techniques for detecting anti-pattern regions. Effectively compensates for LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

Conclusion: First specialized benchmark enables evaluation of ML models for anti-pattern detection in traces. Iterative ML+LLM approach provides effective solution for automating performance analysis, making it accessible beyond large tech companies.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

*Shuxin Zhao,Bo Lang,Nan Xiao,Yilang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIS-BA is a novel backdoor attack paradigm for object detection systems that uses continuous inter-object interaction patterns as triggers instead of static pixel-level cues, enabling multi-trigger-multi-object attacks with robust geometric relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks for object detection are limited by single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues, making them insufficient for real-world applications like autonomous driving that face complex interaction scenarios.

Method: CIS-BA models inter-object interaction patterns as a continuous interaction space, creating space triggers that use invariant geometric relations. CIS-Frame implements this by constructing space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizing them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embedding the backdoor during detector training.

Result: Achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments, maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, and evades three state-of-the-art defenses on MS-COCO and real-world videos.

Conclusion: CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into object detection system security by shifting from static object features to continuous interaction patterns.

Abstract: Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.

Introduces FastDDHPose method using disentangled diffusion modeling that separately models bone length and direction distributions to avoid hierarchical error accumulation. Also designs Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser to focus on joint hierarchies without complex topology modeling.

Result: Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across methods and significantly improves training efficiency. FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

Conclusion: The Fast3DHPE framework addresses the lack of standardization in 3D HPE research, enabling fair comparisons and efficient development. FastDDHPose demonstrates superior performance through its disentangled diffusion approach and hierarchical modeling, showing strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Existing clustering-based semantic uncertainty methods are fragile, sensitive to phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group/separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates.

Method: SGPU maps generated answers into dense semantic space, computes Gram matrix of their embeddings, summarizes semantic configuration via eigenspectrum, and feeds this spectral representation into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty. Works in both black-box and white-box settings.

Result: Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

Conclusion: SGPU provides a robust Bayesian framework for semantic uncertainty estimation that avoids brittle clustering methods, achieves superior performance across diverse tasks and models, and demonstrates transferability across modalities, making it a general solution for reliable uncertainty quantification in vision-language models.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spherical Voronoi (SV) is proposed as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing limitations of Spherical Harmonics (SH) in capturing high-frequency signals and specular reflections while maintaining optimization simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiance field methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting rely on Spherical Harmonics (SH) for appearance modeling, which have fundamental limitations: they struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections essential for realistic rendering. Existing alternatives like spherical Gaussians add significant optimization complexity.

Method: The paper proposes Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV maintains competitive results with simpler optimization. For reflections, SV is used as learnable reflection probes that take reflected directions as input following classical graphics principles.

Result: The SV framework achieves state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It demonstrates superior performance in capturing specular reflections where SH fails, while maintaining efficiency and simplicity in optimization compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: Spherical Voronoi offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, overcoming the limitations of Spherical Harmonics while avoiding the complexity of other alternatives.

Abstract: Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.

TL;DR: SkyLume is a large-scale UAV dataset for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction, featuring 100k+ images from 10 urban regions captured at three times of day, with LiDAR ground truth and a new Temporal Consistency Coefficient metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting methods struggle with multi-temporal UAV data where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day cause color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and appearance inconsistencies. There's a lack of datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions.

Method: The authors introduce SkyLume dataset with three key components: (1) Data collection from 10 urban regions with 100k+ high-resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), each region captured at three periods of day to isolate illumination changes. (2) Per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground truth for evaluating depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality. (3) Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC) metric for inverse rendering that measures cross-time albedo stability and evaluates light-material disentanglement robustness.

Result: The paper presents SkyLume as a comprehensive dataset resource, but does not report specific experimental results or performance metrics in the abstract. The dataset is positioned as a foundation for future research rather than presenting specific algorithm results.

Conclusion: SkyLume fills a critical gap by providing the first large-scale, real-world UAV dataset for studying illumination-robust 3D reconstruction in urban scenes. The dataset, with its systematic multi-temporal capture, LiDAR ground truth, and TCC metric, aims to advance research in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis under varying illumination conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.

TL;DR: DRAW2ACT is a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework for robotic manipulation that extracts multiple trajectory representations and jointly generates aligned RGB-depth videos to enhance consistency and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models are powerful simulators for embodied AI but lack controllability for robotic manipulation. Existing trajectory-conditioned video generation methods are limited by 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, restricting their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations.

Method: Extracts multiple orthogonal representations (depth, semantics, shape, motion) from input trajectories and injects them into diffusion model.

Uses multimodal policy model conditioned on generated RGB-depth sequences to regress robot joint angles.

Result: Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: DRAW2ACT addresses limitations of current video diffusion models for robotic manipulation by introducing depth-aware trajectory conditioning and joint RGB-depth generation, resulting in improved controllability, consistency, and manipulation performance.

*Xichen Ding,Jianzhe Gao,Cong Pan,Wenguan Wang,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HETT framework improves aerial navigation by combining global reasoning and local scene analysis through a two-stage transformer approach with historical context integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV agents for aerial vision-and-language navigation use mono-granularity frameworks that fail to balance global environmental reasoning with local scene comprehension, limiting navigation performance in large-scale urban environments.

Method: Proposes History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) with coarse-to-fine navigation: 1) coarse-grained target prediction by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, 2) fine-grained action refinement via visual analysis, plus historical grid map for structured spatial memory.

Result: Experiments on refined CityNav dataset show significant performance gains, with ablation studies confirming effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: HETT successfully addresses the mono-granularity limitation by integrating global and local reasoning through a two-stage approach with historical context, improving aerial navigation performance.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (AVLN) requires Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agents to localize targets in large-scale urban environments based on linguistic instructions. While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality. Experiments on the refined CityNav dataset show that HETT delivers significant performance gains, while extensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: OminiGen provides an effective solution for generating aligned multimodal sensor data, addressing the limitations of single-modality approaches and enabling more efficient data synthesis for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.

Method: Proposes a multi-view deep learning approach that extracts information from all three MRI views (axial, sagittal, coronal) without using complex 3D models. Introduces a novel tumor slice extraction technique and compares against state-of-the-art models with a reproducible pipeline.

Result: The method demonstrates efficacy in detecting MGMT methylation status, shows superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics, and avoids issues of high parameter count, slow convergence, and memory demands associated with 3D models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of non-invasive radiogenomics for MGMT methylation detection, contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment, and promotes transparency through reproducible pipeline sharing.

Abstract: The presence of MGMT promoter methylation significantly affects how well chemotherapy works for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViBES is a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement using a multimodal transformer architecture, enabling socially competent interaction beyond traditional co-speech gesture generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior systems treat human behavior as translation tasks (co-speech gesture or text-to-motion) without agentic decision-making, leading to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented multimodal stacks.

Method: ViBES uses a speech-language-behavior model with mixture-of-modality-experts backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion that process interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality and cross-expert attention.

Result: The system achieves consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines in multi-turn conversation benchmarks, with better dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, supporting mixed-initiative interaction.

Conclusion: ViBES advances beyond speech-conditioned motion generation toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

Abstract: Human communication is inherently multimodal and social: words, prosody, and body language jointly carry intent. Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond "speech-conditioned motion generation" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction. Code and data will be made available at: ai.stanford.edu/~juze/ViBES/

*Shuai Dong,Jie Zhang,Guoying Zhao,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SIFM, a novel image immunization method against unauthorized diffusion-based edits, and introduces ISR, a new metric to properly evaluate immunization success based on semantic disruption rather than output similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image immunization evaluation metrics are flawed - they measure visual dissimilarity to reference outputs rather than assessing whether semantic alignment with attacker intent is disrupted. This overlooks the core goal of immunization: to prevent malicious edits regardless of output deviation.

Method: SIFM (Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation) perturbs intermediate diffusion features using dual objectives: 1) maximizing feature divergence from original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment, and 2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations.

Result: Extensive experiments show SIFM achieves state-of-the-art performance in safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation. The proposed ISR metric provides rigorous quantification of true immunization efficacy.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the limitations of existing immunization evaluation by proposing a principled approach (SIFM) and proper metric (ISR) that focus on disrupting semantic alignment with attacker intent rather than output similarity.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automotive radar is cost-effective and robust in adverse weather, but limited annotated radar data hinders advancement of radar-based perception systems. Need synthetic radar data generation to overcome annotation scarcity.

Method: Proposes 4D-RaDiff framework that applies diffusion to latent point cloud representations (not image-based) to handle radar sparsity. Uses conditioning at object or scene level to control generation. Converts unlabeled bounding boxes into radar annotations and transforms LiDAR data into realistic radar scenes.

Result: Synthetic radar data from 4D-RaDiff improves object detection performance when used as data augmentation. Pre-training on synthetic data reduces required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable detection performance to real data training.

Conclusion: 4D-RaDiff effectively addresses radar data scarcity by generating high-quality synthetic radar point clouds, enabling improved object detection performance and significant reduction in required annotated real data.

Abstract: Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.

We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob.

*Jie Zhang,Shuai Dong,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DANP is a novel immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt text-to-image diffusion models, preventing malicious edits by manipulating attention maps and noise prediction across multiple timesteps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models enable powerful image editing but create ethical risks for generating deceptive/harmful content. Current defense methods using imperceptible perturbations are ineffective against malicious tampering, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) operates over multiple timesteps to manipulate cross-attention maps and noise prediction. It uses dynamic thresholds to create masks identifying text-relevant/irrelevant regions, reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, and maximizes discrepancy between injected and predicted noise.

Result: DANP demonstrates impressive immunity against malicious edits and achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments, effectively preventing unauthorized image manipulation while preserving intended targets.

Conclusion: The proposed DANP method successfully addresses the security vulnerabilities of text-to-image diffusion models by targeting both attention mechanisms and noise prediction, providing robust protection against malicious editing while maintaining imperceptibility of the defensive perturbations.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EVPG enhances Visual Programming for visual reasoning by converting the non-differentiable VP execution process into a differentiable probabilistic graph, enabling end-to-end gradient-based optimization using final task labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous VP enhancement methods focused only on improving LLM-generated visual programs but neglected optimizing the pre-trained models invoked by VP for sub-tasks. The non-differentiable nature of VP prevents gradient-based optimization using final task labels, and sub-task labels are unavailable.

Method: EVPG builds a directed probabilistic graph based on variable dependency relationships during VP execution, reconstructing the non-differentiable process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this graph.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance improvements for VP on three complex visual reasoning tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images, demonstrating EVPG's effectiveness and advantages.

Conclusion: EVPG successfully enables gradient-based optimization for VP frameworks by making the execution process differentiable through probabilistic graph modeling, allowing end-to-end supervised learning using only final task labels.

Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using imperceptible perturbations to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations.

Method: Proposes TDAE with two components: 1) FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM) at visual level using gradient regularization to steer perturbations toward flat minima, and 2) Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD) for textual enhancement that periodically refines text embeddings through adversarial optimization to align editing outcomes.

Result: Extensive experiments show TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations, demonstrating superior cross-model transferability.

Conclusion: TDAE effectively addresses the transferability limitation of existing methods through coordinated bimodal optimization, providing robust defense against malicious image edits across different editing models.

Abstract: Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.

Method: Introduces DriverGaze360 dataset with panoramic 360° field of view and DriverGaze360-Net model that jointly learns attention maps and attended objects using an auxiliary semantic segmentation head for improved spatial awareness.

Result: DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics for panoramic driving images, demonstrating comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior.

Conclusion: The panoramic approach enables better understanding of driver attention in complex driving scenarios and supports explainable autonomous driving systems and mixed traffic analysis.

Abstract: Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

Method: Proposes a self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, achieving fair allocation of prediction scores to image patches with minor structural modifications.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability while preserving model performance and compatibility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing explanation methods by providing faithful explanations that inherently align with model decision logic without sacrificing performance or compatibility.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their decision-making processes remain opaque. Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility.

TL;DR: Zoom-Zero is a coarse-to-fine framework for grounded video QA that improves temporal grounding by first localizing relevant segments, then zooming into salient frames for visual verification, addressing limitations of existing GRPO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large video-language models have limited temporal awareness for grounded video QA, and existing GRPO-based approaches struggle with faithful temporal grounding, leading to mislocalization and hallucinations.

Method: A coarse-to-fine framework with two key innovations: 1) zoom-in accuracy reward for validating temporal grounding and fine-grained visual verification, and 2) token-selective credit assignment to attribute rewards to relevant tokens for temporal localization or answer generation.

Result: Improves temporal grounding by 5.2% on NExT-GQA and 4.6% on ReXTime, enhances average answer accuracy by 2.4%, and yields 6.4% average improvement on long-video benchmarks through coarse-to-fine zoom-in.

Conclusion: Zoom-Zero advances grounded video QA by addressing GRPO limitations, improving both temporal grounding and answer accuracy while benefiting long-form video understanding through its coarse-to-fine approach.

Abstract: Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISCODE is a finetuning-free method that improves LVLM-based image caption evaluation robustness across domains using test-time adaptive scoring with Gaussian priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models struggle with robust image caption evaluation, especially under domain-shift scenarios where evaluation metrics need to work consistently across diverse domains.

Method: DISCODE uses a Distribution-Aware Score Decoder with test-time adaptive evaluation, introducing an Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss with Gaussian prior distribution. It minimizes this loss efficiently at test time using an analytical solution.

Result: DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across the new MCEval benchmark (covering six domains) and four existing benchmarks, showing better alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: DISCODE provides a robust, finetuning-free solution for image caption evaluation that adapts to domain shifts and better aligns with human judgments across diverse domains.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: TUN provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in persistence diagrams, which are critical for downstream applications in topological data analysis.

Abstract: Persistence diagrams (PDs) provide a powerful tool for understanding the topology of the underlying shape of a point cloud. However, identifying which points in PDs encode genuine signals remains challenging. This challenge directly hinders the practical adoption of topological data analysis in many applications, where automated and reliable interpretation of persistence diagrams is essential for downstream decision-making. In this paper, we study automatic significance detection for one-dimensional persistence diagrams. Specifically, we propose Topology Understanding Net (TUN), a multi-modal network that combines enhanced PD descriptors with self-attention, a PointNet-style point cloud encoder, learned fusion, and per-point classification, alongside stable preprocessing and imbalance-aware training. It provides an automated and effective solution for identifying significant points in PDs, which are critical for downstream applications. Experiments show that TUN outperforms classic methods in detecting significant points in PDs, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, which may not achieve optimal temporal coherence and structural consistency. The scarcity of 4D training data also presents a challenge for direct 4D generation.

Method: 1) Builds on pre-trained single-image-to-3D model for spatial consistency; 2) Introduces dedicated temporal layers for cross-frame reasoning; 3) Uses factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling to compress latent sequences; 4) Employs carefully designed training strategy for occlusion robustness.

Conclusion: SS4D demonstrates that native 4D generative modeling with compressed spacetime latents is effective for synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from monocular video, offering advantages over approaches that optimize over existing 3D or video models.

Abstract: We present SS4D, a native 4D generative model that synthesizes dynamic 3D objects directly from monocular video. Unlike prior approaches that construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, we train a generator directly on 4D data, achieving high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency. At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames. (3) To support efficient training and inference over long video sequences, we compress the latent sequence along the temporal axis using factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling blocks. In addition, we employ a carefully designed training strategy to enhance robustness against occlusion

Abstract: Tunnels are essential elements of transportation infrastructure, but are increasingly affected by ageing and deterioration mechanisms such as cracking. Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation.

*Andreas Lolos,Theofilos Christodoulou,Aris L. Moustakas,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPRMIL introduces a context-aware patch representation framework for Multiple Instance Learning in computational pathology that achieves SOTA performance with significantly reduced computational complexity and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weak supervision is standard in computational pathology due to gigapixel WSIs and scarce pixel-level annotations. Current MIL methods rely on complex attention-based aggregation, creating computational bottlenecks. The authors aim to simplify MIL by moving correlation learning from the aggregator to patch representation.

Method: CAPRMIL projects patch features from a frozen encoder into global context/morphology-aware tokens using multi-head self-attention with linear computational complexity. It uses a simple Mean MIL aggregator after creating rich context-aware patch embeddings, removing correlation learning from the aggregator.

Result: Matches SOTA slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks while reducing trainable parameters by 48%-92.8%, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time.

Conclusion: Learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis, offering significant computational efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

*Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that recovers semantic structure from fragmented SVG elements to enable reliable animation by vision-language models through statistical aggregation of weak part predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG animation is challenging for VLMs because visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes, making it difficult to determine which elements should move together. Current VLM systems lack the semantic understanding needed for reliable animation.

Method: Introduces a framework that recovers semantic structure by statistically aggregating multiple weak part predictions, reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups to provide better guidance for animation.

Result: The approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence, demonstrating substantial gains over existing approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: Semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

TL;DR: CLNet is a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework for image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization that explicitly models spatial correspondences between satellite and street-level images through three complementary modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-view geo-localization rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization between significantly different viewpoints like satellite and street-level images.

Method: CLNet decomposes view alignment into three learnable modules: 1) Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields, 2) Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using MLP-based transformation, and 3) Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks (CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652) demonstrate that CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.

Conclusion: CLNet successfully bridges semantic and geometric gaps between different views by explicitly modeling spatial correspondences, enabling joint capture of both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments for improved cross-view geo-localization.

Abstract: Image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization (IRCVGL) aims to match images captured from significantly different viewpoints, such as satellite and street-level images. Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HGS proposes a compact dynamic view synthesis framework using hybrid Gaussian splatting with static-dynamic decomposition, achieving 98% model size reduction and real-time 125 FPS rendering at 4K resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic novel view synthesis methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting suffer from excessive model complexity, parameter redundancy, large model sizes, and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS) with Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy using Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling. Dynamic regions use time-dependent RBFs to capture temporal variations, while static regions share temporally invariant parameters to reduce redundancy. Includes two-stage training for temporal coherence at boundaries.

Result: Reduces model size by up to 98%, achieves real-time rendering at 125 FPS at 4K resolution on RTX 3090, sustains 160 FPS at 1352×1014 on RTX 3050, integrated into VR system. Comparable rendering quality to SOTA with improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.

Conclusion: HGS provides an efficient, compact framework for dynamic novel view synthesis that significantly reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining high rendering quality and enabling real-time performance on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.

*Ankita Raj,Kaashika Prajaapat,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Chetan Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Progressive blurring curriculum inspired by human visual development improves CNN generalization and robustness by training on blurred images initially and gradually reducing blur, reducing corruption error by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human visual system adapts well to input distribution changes, while CNNs struggle. Inspired by human infants' visual development (poor acuity at birth, gradual refinement), the authors propose mimicking this process to improve CNN generalization and robustness.

Method: Progressive blurring curriculum: train CNNs on highly blurred images during initial epochs, then progressively reduce blur as training advances. This structured progression encourages networks to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, unlike static blur-based augmentation that applies blur randomly.

Result: Reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C compared to standard training. Enhances robustness against distribution shifts, noisy inputs, and adversarial attacks. Works well with other augmentation techniques like CutMix and MixUp.

Conclusion: Early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy, contrary to prior claims that early blurring harms performance. The progressive curriculum approach yields consistent gains across datasets and complements existing augmentation methods.

Abstract: The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

TL;DR: FakeRadar is a deepfake detection framework that improves cross-domain generalization by using pretrained models to identify distribution gaps and generating synthetic outlier samples to simulate unseen manipulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection methods fail to generalize well to unseen manipulation techniques because they rely on manipulation-specific cues. There's a need for methods that can adapt to emerging forgery patterns in real-world scenarios.

Method: Uses large-scale pretrained models (CLIP) to probe feature space and identify distribution gaps. Introduces Forgery Outlier Probing with dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples. Implements Outlier-Guided Tri-Training with outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses.

Result: FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly excelling in cross-domain evaluations by effectively handling emerging manipulation techniques.

Conclusion: FakeRadar successfully addresses cross-domain generalization challenges in deepfake detection by proactively identifying distribution gaps and simulating unseen forgery artifacts, making it robust against emerging manipulation techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene understanding models are task-specific and limited due to real-world complexity. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle diverse semantic tasks efficiently.

Method: A Unified Semantic Transformer (UNITE) that operates end-to-end on RGB images, using 2D distillation with self-supervision and novel multi-view losses for 3D consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple semantic tasks, often surpassing task-specific models and methods using ground truth 3D geometry.

Conclusion: UNITE demonstrates that a single unified model can effectively handle diverse 3D semantic tasks from RGB images, offering efficient and comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding involves capturing and parsing unstructured 3D environments. Due to the inherent complexity of the real world, existing models have predominantly been developed and limited to be task-specific. We introduce UNITE, a Unified Semantic Transformer for 3D scene understanding, a novel feed-forward neural network that unifies a diverse set of 3D semantic tasks within a single model. Our model operates on unseen scenes in a fully end-to-end manner and only takes a few seconds to infer the full 3D semantic geometry. Our approach is capable of directly predicting multiple semantic attributes, including 3D scene segmentation, instance embeddings, open-vocabulary features, as well as affordance and articulations, solely from RGB images. The method is trained using a combination of 2D distillation, heavily relying on self-supervision and leverages novel multi-view losses designed to ensure 3D view consistency. We demonstrate that UNITE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several different semantic tasks and even outperforms task-specific models, in many cases, surpassing methods that operate on ground truth 3D geometry.

TL;DR: Vanilla MLPs can learn high-frequency content if rank degradation during training is addressed; using optimizers like Muon that maintain high-rank updates significantly improves INR performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that vanilla MLPs inherently cannot represent high-frequency content, suggesting instead that the low-frequency bias is due to rank degradation during training rather than architectural limitations.

Method: Regulate network rank during training using optimizers like Muon that produce high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, enabling even simple MLP architectures to learn high-frequency signals effectively.

Result: Substantial improvements across diverse domains including natural/medical images and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The low-frequency bias in vanilla MLPs is not an architectural limitation but a training issue related to rank degradation; addressing this through rank regulation enables MLPs to effectively learn high-frequency content without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) based on vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are widely believed to be incapable of representing high-frequency content. This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: Deep learning models achieve over 80% accuracy for lymphoma subtyping on in-distribution data but drop to ~60% on out-of-distribution data, highlighting generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lymphoma diagnosis requires multiple specialized tests causing delays and high costs. Deep learning could assist pathologists using routinely available HE-stained slides, but comprehensive multicenter benchmarks are lacking.

Method: Created first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common subtypes and healthy tissue. Evaluated five pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) with AB-MIL and TransMIL aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x).

Result: Models achieved >80% multiclass balanced accuracy on in-distribution test sets across all magnifications, with similar performance across foundation models and aggregation methods. 40x resolution was sufficient with no gains from higher resolutions. Performance dropped to ~60% on out-of-distribution test sets.

Conclusion: While models perform well on in-distribution data, significant generalization challenges exist. Larger multicenter studies covering rare subtypes are needed. An automated benchmarking pipeline is provided to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.

TL;DR: LCMem is a cross-domain memorization detection model that treats memorization as both re-identification and copy detection, achieving significant improvements over existing methods for privacy auditing of generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models can create realistic images that deceive humans, but their privacy-preserving potential is unclear due to unreliable memorization detection, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of privacy auditing methods across domains.

Method: Proposes Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem) that views memorization detection as a unified problem combining re-identification (identity consistency) and copy detection (augmentation-robust duplication). Uses two-stage training: first learns identity consistency, then incorporates augmentation-robust copy detection.

Result: Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Shows existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness.

Conclusion: LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection for generative models, highlighting the need for stronger privacy protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPS is a training-free image editing method that synergistically combines positional embeddings and semantic information to achieve faithful non-rigid edits (pose/shape changes) in diffusion models, addressing attention collapse issues in existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing training-free image editing methods with large diffusion models struggle with complex non-rigid edits due to attention collapse, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate, leading to over-editing or under-editing.

Method: SynPS introduces an editing measurement to quantify required editing magnitude at each denoising step, and an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates positional embedding influence to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate superior performance and faithfulness compared to existing methods, effectively avoiding both over- and under-editing.

Conclusion: SynPS successfully addresses attention collapse in diffusion-based image editing by adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, enabling faithful non-rigid edits without training.

Abstract: Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.

### [86] [Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14435)
*Chang Cai,Hao Jiang,Xiaojun Yuan,Ying-Jun Angela Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STMP integrates score-based MMSE denoisers into message-passing for compressive imaging, achieving better performance-complexity tradeoff than traditional PnP methods, with Q-STMP handling quantized measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional plug-and-play methods use generic denoisers that fail to capture complex image statistics, while score-based models are accurate but computationally expensive for posterior sampling.

Method: Developed score-based turbo message passing (STMP) that integrates score-based MMSE denoisers into message-passing framework, with Q-STMP adding component-wise MMSE dequantization for quantized measurements.

Result: STMP achieves significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff than baselines, converges within 10 iterations, and Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization.

Conclusion: STMP combines fast message-passing convergence with expressive score-based priors, providing accurate performance prediction via state-evolution equations and robust handling of quantization.

Abstract: Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained on real video data using sparse keymask pseudo-annotations and Sparse-To-Dense Distillation with Temporal DropLoss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised video instance segmentation relies on synthetic video data from object-centric image datasets, which fails to accurately model realistic motion like perspective changes, part movements, and camera motion.

Method: 1) Start with unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual frames; 2) Establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks using deep motion priors; 3) Use sparse keymask pseudo-annotations to train segmentation model via Sparse-To-Dense Distillation with Temporal DropLoss; 4) Train final model on resulting dense labelset.

Result: The approach outperforms current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: Training unsupervised video instance segmentation exclusively on real video data with temporal coherence establishment and sparse-to-dense distillation effectively addresses limitations of synthetic data approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A4-Agent is a training-free framework that decouples affordance prediction into three specialized foundation models: Dreamer visualizes interactions, Thinker identifies object parts, and Spotter locates interaction areas, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end affordance prediction models couple high-level reasoning with low-level grounding in monolithic pipelines, requiring annotated datasets and suffering from poor generalization to novel objects and unseen environments.

Method: Proposes A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline using specialized foundation models: Dreamer (generative models for visualizing interactions), Thinker (vision-language models for deciding what to interact with), and Spotter (vision foundation models for precise localization).

Result: The zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings without any task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: By decoupling affordance prediction and leveraging complementary strengths of pre-trained foundation models without training, A4-Agent achieves superior generalization and performance compared to traditional supervised approaches.

Abstract: Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.

*Weiheng Zhao,Zilong Huang,Jiashi Feng,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperCLIP enhances CLIP by adding token-level classification supervision to improve fine-grained visual-text alignment without needing extra data or significant computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, especially with long captions, because they only optimize global image-text similarity and lack token-level supervision.

Method: Adds a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder for classification-based supervision alongside contrastive learning, using token-level cues to enhance alignment with minimal computational increase (0.077% more FLOPs).

Result: Consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and visual tasks; works with both original web data and re-captioned data; alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop.

Conclusion: SuperCLIP effectively recovers textual supervision through simple classification augmentation, enhancing fine-grained alignment without additional data or significant computational cost.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.

We also extracted 2D keypoints related to the hands, face and body of the users. With the dataset, we propose a benchmark for the sign recognition task, adopting several state-of-the-art models showing how temporal information, 2D keypoints and RGB frames can be influence the performance of these models.

Motivation: Current retinal foundation models are limited by curated research datasets lacking clinical context and require extensive task-specific optimization, which hinders deployment in low-resource settings. The authors aim to overcome these barriers by learning directly from real-world clinical practice.

Method: Built ReVision by learning from natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and corresponding diagnostic reports accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China.

Conclusion: Clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without further annotation to build medical AI systems suitable for low-resource settings, demonstrating the value of learning from real-world telemedicine programs.

Abstract: Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.

TL;DR: DASP: A self-supervised framework using spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation, addressing low visibility and moving object challenges through adversarial learning and 3D consistency projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation works well in daytime but deteriorates at night due to low visibility (textureless areas) and varying illumination (blurry regions from moving objects).

Method: DASP framework with two branches: 1) Adversarial branch with spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) containing spatial-based temporal learning (STLM) and axial spatial learning (ASLM) modules; 2) Self-supervised branch with 3D consistency projection loss for bilateral projection into shared 3D space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets for nighttime depth estimation; ablation studies validate effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: DASP effectively addresses nighttime depth estimation challenges by leveraging spatiotemporal priors and 3D consistency, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based identity-preserved portrait generation methods produce lower-fidelity results when using multiple reference images and struggle to precisely customize face attributes.

Method: Introduces face refiner and landmark generator for fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware landmarks; designs HiFi-Net to fuse features and align with landmarks; creates automated pipeline for ID-based dataset construction.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in face similarity and controllability; compatible with previous SDXL-based works.

Conclusion: HiFi-Portrait effectively addresses fidelity and control limitations in identity-preserved portrait generation, achieving superior performance in both identity preservation and attribute customization.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAT is a task-adaptive Transformer framework for medical image restoration that addresses task interference and imbalance in All-in-One models through task-specific weight generation and dynamic loss balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current All-in-One medical image restoration models face challenges with task interference (conflicting gradient updates across tasks) and task imbalance (uneven optimization due to varying learning difficulties), which hinder performance when handling diverse tasks with different modalities and degradation types.

Method: Proposes TAT with two key innovations: 1) Task-adaptive weight generation strategy that creates task-specific weight parameters to eliminate gradient conflicts on shared parameters, and 2) Task-adaptive loss balancing strategy that dynamically adjusts loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties to prevent task domination or undertraining.

Result: Extensive experiments show TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks (PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution) in both task-specific and All-in-One settings.

Conclusion: TAT effectively addresses the critical challenges of task interference and imbalance in All-in-One medical image restoration models through adaptive mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance across multiple restoration tasks.

Abstract: Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

Method: Created FoodLogAthl-218 dataset from real meal records collected through FoodLog Athl app, containing 6,925 images across 218 food categories with 14,349 bounding boxes, accompanied by rich metadata including meal timing, user IDs, and meal context.

Result: Dataset provides greater intra-class diversity, natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual unfiltered images. Introduces three tasks: standard classification, incremental fine-tuning following temporal user logs, and context-aware classification for multi-dish meals.

Conclusion: FoodLogAthl-218 addresses limitations of web-crawled datasets by providing real-world meal photos with rich contextual metadata, enabling more realistic evaluation of food classification models for dietary management applications.

Abstract: Food image classification models are crucial for dietary management applications because they reduce the burden of manual meal logging. However, most publicly available datasets for training such models rely on web-crawled images, which often differ from users' real-world meal photos. In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context. We evaluate these tasks using large multimodal models (LMMs). The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FoodLog/FoodLogAthl-218.

*Chenyu Zhao,Yingxue Xu,Fengtao Zhou,Yihui Wang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KEMM is an LLM-driven knowledge-enhanced multimodal model for cancer survival prediction that integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge to improve feature extraction from redundant pathology images and genomic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal survival prediction methods struggle with high-dimensional, redundant data (WSIs and genomics) and insufficient supervision from simple survival labels. There's a need for better feature extraction and modality alignment.

Method: KEMM integrates two knowledge sources: 1) LLM-refined expert reports providing case-specific diagnostic statements, and 2) LLM-generated prognostic background knowledge on cancer types. Uses knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module to focus on discriminative survival-relevant features.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in cancer survival prediction.

Conclusion: Integrating expert knowledge and prognostic background via LLMs significantly enhances multimodal survival prediction by guiding attention to clinically relevant features in redundant data.

Abstract: Current multimodal survival prediction methods typically rely on pathology images (WSIs) and genomic data, both of which are high-dimensional and redundant, making it difficult to extract discriminative features from them and align different modalities. Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frame-based cameras in ITS perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras offer low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution but lack sufficient research and datasets for ITS applications.

Method: Created a pilot dataset for event-based ITS covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. Established a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset.

Result: Achieved excellent performance on the tracking benchmark using the proposed approach and dataset.

Conclusion: Event cameras have considerable potential to overcome limitations of frame-based cameras in ITS, and this work provides foundational resources (dataset and benchmark) to advance event-based vision research for transportation systems.

Abstract: In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), multi-object tracking is primarily based on frame-based cameras. However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.

TL;DR: SFVD proposes single-frame video set distillation that distills videos into informative frames per class, using differentiable interpolation to create video sequences while restricting updates to frames for better optimization efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset distillation works well for images but struggles with videos due to increased parameters from temporal dimension, which complicates optimization and leads to suboptimal performance.

Method: SFVD distills videos into single informative frames per class, uses differentiable interpolation to transform frames into video sequences, restricts updates to frames only, and incorporates temporal information by combining distilled frames with real videos via channel reshaping.

Result: SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods on multiple benchmarks, achieving up to 5.3% improvement on MiniUCF dataset.

Conclusion: SFVD offers a more effective solution for video set distillation by addressing optimization challenges through single-frame distillation with temporal information incorporation.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMD-HookNet++ is a hybrid CNN-Transformer model for glacier segmentation and calving front delineation in SAR images, achieving state-of-the-art performance with smoother edge results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based glacier segmentation models (like AMD-HookNet) struggle with long-range dependencies due to convolution's local nature, while pure Transformer approaches produce jagged edges. There's a need for a model that combines global context with local detail preservation for accurate glacier monitoring.

Method: Proposes AMD-HookNet++ with two branches: Transformer-based context branch for long-range dependencies and global context, and CNN-based target branch for local detail preservation. Includes enhanced spatial-channel attention module to strengthen hybrid feature interactions, and pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision for optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CaFFe benchmark: IoU of 78.2, HD95 of 1,318 m, and competitive MDE of 367 m. Produces smoother calving front delineations compared to pure Transformer approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture effectively combines global context from Transformers with local detail preservation from CNNs, resulting in superior glacier segmentation and smoother calving front delineations for improved glacier monitoring.

Abstract: The dynamics of glaciers and ice shelf fronts significantly impact the mass balance of ice sheets and coastal sea levels. To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m. More importantly, our hybrid model produces smoother delineations of calving fronts, resolving the issue of jagged edges typically seen in pure Transformer-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation on MRI is challenging due to wide variations in tumor types. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks methods on diverse datasets including pediatric tumors, meningiomas, and brain metastases.

Method: A flexible, modular pipeline that selects and combines state-of-the-art models with tumor- and lesion-specific pre- and post-processing. Uses radiomic features for tumor subtype detection to balance training, and custom lesion-level metrics to optimize ensemble weighting and post-processing.

Result: Achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple BraTS testing sets, demonstrating robust segmentation across diverse tumor types including pediatric tumors, meningiomas, and brain metastases.

Conclusion: Custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations without locking to specific network architectures. The method has potential for clinical quantitative tumor measurement to support diagnosis and prognosis.

Abstract: Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs perform textual reasoning from static images only, missing dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. Humans repeatedly examine images and use step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions, following Miller's Law in cognitive science.

Method: Propose ViRC framework with Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive CRUs. Create CRUX dataset with explicit CRU annotations using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns. Use progressive training: Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL.

Result: ViRC-7B model achieves 18.8% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViRC framework effectively simulates human expert problem-solving patterns by decomposing multimodal mathematical reasoning into structured CRUs, significantly enhancing MLLM performance on mathematical tasks.

Abstract: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

TL;DR: FiNERweb is a scalable dataset-creation pipeline for multilingual NER that uses LLMs to generate synthetic supervision across 91 languages and 25 scripts, producing high-quality annotations with 225k passages and 235k entity labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multilingual NER work lacks systematic, reusable datasets from LLM-based synthetic supervision, which mostly appear as by-products rather than dedicated resources.

Method: Pipeline trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages from FineWeb-Edu, then annotates them with multilingual LLMs, scaling teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts.

Result: Regression model achieves >84 F1; models trained on FiNERweb show comparable/improved zero-shot transfer on English, Thai, and Swahili with 19x less data; LLM-as-judge scores show high faithfulness (3.99/5) and completeness (4.05/5).

Conclusion: FiNERweb provides reliable multilingual NER annotations and is released with English and translated labels to facilitate more effective student-teacher training, addressing performance drops when using target language labels instead of English ones.

Abstract: Recent multilingual named entity recognition (NER) work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can provide effective synthetic supervision, yet such datasets have mostly appeared as by-products of broader experiments rather than as systematic, reusable resources. We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches struggle to maintain both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks, creating a need for methods that can handle complex entity relationships and boundaries.

Method: Uses pretrained language models for context-aware representations, introduces candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling, captures multi-granular entity span features, applies hierarchical structural constraints during decoding, and jointly optimizes classification loss with structural consistency loss.

Result: Experiments on ACE 2005 dataset show significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with particularly strong performance in nested and overlapping entity recognition, demonstrating better boundary localization and structural modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: Structure-aware decoding is effective for complex semantic extraction tasks, provides new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

*Yi Hu,Cai Zhou,Muhan Zhang*

TL;DR: LLMs underuse their depth across scales, training types, and task difficulties - effective depth ratio remains stable despite model growth, and reasoning improvements come from longer context rather than deeper computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why performance gains diminish with added layers in LLMs and investigate how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty.

Method: Systematic analysis of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B), comparing base vs. long-CoT models, and evaluating across tasks of varying difficulty to measure effective depth.

Result: Effective layers grow with model size but ratio remains stable; no increase in effective depth between base and long-CoT models; models don't use more layers for harder problems.

Conclusion: Current LLMs underuse available depth across all tested dimensions, pointing to opportunities for improving layer utilization, model pruning, and early exiting strategies.

Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of "effective depth", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting. Our code is released at https://github.com/AheadOFpotato/what_affects_effective_depth.

TL;DR: Efficient-DLM converts pretrained autoregressive language models into efficient diffusion language models that achieve higher throughput while maintaining accuracy through block-wise attention patterns and position-dependent token masking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion language models enable parallel non-autoregressive generation but lag behind autoregressive models in learning efficiency when trained from scratch. The goal is to convert pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that preserve AR accuracy while gaining speed advantages.

Method: 1) Systematic comparison of attention patterns leading to block-wise attention that remains causal across blocks but bidirectional within blocks, preserving pretrained weight distributions. 2) Position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens to bridge training-test gap. 3) Extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and design choices.

Result: Efficient-DLM family outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs. Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed AR-to-dLM conversion framework with block-wise attention and position-dependent masking enables efficient diffusion language models that combine the speed advantages of parallel generation with the accuracy of pretrained autoregressive models.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

TL;DR: UniSparse introduces composite tokens for multi-granularity compression and block-level selection to enable efficient sparse attention that achieves near-full attention accuracy with significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic scaling of self-attention with sequence length creates computational bottlenecks for long-context LLM applications, while existing sparse attention methods face trade-offs between training cost, efficiency, and cross-modal generality.

Method: UniSparse uses composite tokens that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information, then dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection for hardware-friendly GPU execution.

Result: UniSparse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) across multiple modalities and tasks, achieving ≥99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61× faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

Conclusion: UniSparse provides an effective unified mechanism for efficient long-context understanding that balances accuracy and efficiency while maintaining cross-modal generality.

Abstract: Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior in backchannel responses and develop a unified model for more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems across Japanese, English, and Chinese languages.

Method: Transformer-based frame-level model jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations across three languages, with perturbation analyses and context-length studies to examine cue usage patterns.

Result: Multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines across all three languages, learns both universal and language-specific patterns, shows limited zero-shot transfer, reveals distinct cue usage patterns (Japanese: short-term linguistic info; English/Chinese: silence/prosody), and demonstrates real-time CPU-only inference capability.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence for cross-linguistic differences in backchannel timing, informs design of culturally-aware dialogue systems, and demonstrates that multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations while reducing overreliance on specific cues like pitch in Chinese.

Abstract: We present a multilingual, continuous backchannel prediction model for Japanese, English, and Chinese, and use it to investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior. The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.

*Yiran Zhang,Jincheng Hu,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogMem is a memory-augmented LLM architecture with three layers (LTM, DA, FoA) that improves multi-turn reasoning by managing context growth and reducing common failure modes like reasoning bias and memory decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with extended multi-turn interactions, losing accuracy and coherence. Current approaches append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency.

Method: CogMem introduces a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture with three layers: Long-Term Memory (LTM) for cross-session reasoning strategies, Direct Access (DA) memory for session-level notes and retrieval, and Focus of Attention (FoA) for dynamic reconstruction of concise, task-relevant context.

Result: Experiments on TurnBench show that CogMem mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: The layered memory design enables sustained iterative reasoning, addressing key limitations of current LLMs in multi-turn interactions while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

*Hongqiu Ni,Jiabao Zhang,Guopeng Li,Zilong Wang,Ruiqi Wu,Chi Zhang,Haisheng Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Astraea is a service engine for LLM agent workflows that optimizes end-to-end latency by shifting from local segment optimization to global request lifecycle scheduling, reducing average job completion time by up to 25.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents have multi-stage workflows alternating between local computation and external API calls, creating a mismatch with existing inference systems that focus on per-segment optimization rather than minimizing end-to-end latency of complete agentic workflows.

Method: Astraea uses a state-aware hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates historical state with future predictions, dynamically classifies requests by I/O vs compute intensity, uses enhanced HRRN policy for fairness, and implements adaptive KV cache management during I/O waits based on memory pressure.

Result: Extensive experiments show Astraea reduces average Job Completion Time (JCT) by up to 25.5% compared to baseline methods, with strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

Conclusion: Astraea successfully addresses the optimization mismatch in LLM agent workflows by shifting focus from local segments to global request lifecycle, demonstrating significant performance improvements in end-to-end latency for multi-stage agentic workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.

### [111] [A Comparative Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Techniques for Bengali Standard-to-Dialect Machine Translation Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14179)
*K. M. Jubair Sami,Dipto Sumit,Ariyan Hossain,Farig Sadeque*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes and compares two RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation, finding that a sentence-pair pipeline outperforms transcript-based approaches and enables smaller models to beat larger ones through effective retrieval strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard-to-dialect translation faces challenges due to scarce data and linguistic variation, particularly in Bengali. There's a need for effective solutions that don't require fine-tuning and can handle low-resource scenarios while preserving linguistic diversity.

Method: Two novel RAG pipelines: 1) Transcript-Based Pipeline using large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts, and 2) Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline using structured local_dialect:standard_bengali sentence pairs. Evaluated across six Bengali dialects with multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore metrics.

Result: The sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperformed the transcript-based approach, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76% to 55% for Chittagong dialect. Smaller models (Llama-3.1-8B) outperformed much larger models (GPT-OSS-120B) with the RAG approach, showing retrieval strategy is more crucial than model size.

Conclusion: The work provides an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, demonstrating that well-designed retrieval strategies can be more important than model size, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity in NLP applications.

Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

### [112] [Ladder Up, Memory Down: Low-Cost Fine-Tuning With Side Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14237)
*Estelle Zheng,Nathan Cerisara,Sébastien Warichet,Emmanuel Helbert,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Ladder Side Tuning (LST) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adds a lightweight side network, reducing peak memory by 50% compared to QLoRA while maintaining competitive performance, enabling 7B-parameter model fine-tuning on 12GB GPUs with 2k-token contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models is limited by GPU memory constraints. Existing PEFT methods like QLoRA still incur high memory usage from backward passes in the full model. There's a need for more memory-efficient fine-tuning approaches that don't sacrifice performance.

Method: Revisits Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network to the main model. Introduces xLadder, a depth-extended variant with cross-connections that increases effective depth and shortens chain-of-thought reasoning without additional parameters.

Result: LST cuts peak memory by 50% compared to QLoRA while matching its compute scaling slope and maintaining competitive performance across natural language understanding, mathematical, and LLM-critic tasks. Enables fine-tuning 7B-parameter models on single 12GB GPUs with 2k-token contexts where QLoRA fails.

Conclusion: LST provides superior memory efficiency over QLoRA with comparable performance, making it ideal when memory is the bottleneck. xLadder extends this by enabling deeper reasoning capabilities without additional memory overhead, offering architectural flexibility for improved chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces two Context-Free Grammars for expanding Nawatl language corpora to address the scarcity of digital resources for this Amerindian language, enabling generation of syntactically valid artificial sentences for learning embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nawatl is a Mexican National Language with few digital resources, making corpora for Large Language Models virtually non-existent, which poses significant challenges for language processing and learning tasks.

Method: The authors introduce two new Context-Free Grammars for Nawatl and use them in generative mode to produce syntactically valid artificial sentences, significantly expanding the available corpora for learning non-contextual embeddings.

Result: The expanded corpus shows improvement in results compared to using only the original corpus, and demonstrates that economical embeddings often perform better than some Large Language Models in sentence semantic similarity tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CFG approach effectively addresses the resource scarcity problem for Nawatl, enabling corpus expansion and improved embedding learning, with economic embeddings showing competitive performance against some LLMs.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

TL;DR: EDU-based Context Compressor: A novel explicit compression framework that transforms text into structural relation trees of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing extensive context is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in applications like long-document QA and autonomous agents, where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques disrupt local coherence or suffer from positional bias and API incompatibility.

Method: Two-step structure-then-select process: 1) LingoEDU transforms linear text into structural relation trees of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) anchored to source indices to eliminate hallucination; 2) Lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy, significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Structure-aware compression enhances performance across downstream tasks from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios. Released StructBench dataset of 248 manually annotated documents.

Conclusion: The EDU-based Context Compressor effectively addresses limitations of existing compression techniques by preserving both global structure and fine-grained details through explicit structural representation, offering improved performance and cost efficiency for long-context applications.

Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

*Nikoleta Anesti,Edward Hill,Andreas Joseph*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-3.5 can form inflation perceptions similar to humans but lack consistent inflation models, showing promise for social science applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can form realistic inflation perceptions and expectations comparable to human survey data, and to develop methods for evaluating LLM behavior in social science contexts.

Method: Quasi-experimental design using GPT-3.5's training cut-off (Sept 2021) to test inflation knowledge; comparison with Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey data; Shapley value decomposition for analyzing prompt influence on LLM outputs.

Result: GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons; replicates key empirical regularities of household inflation perceptions by income, housing tenure, and social class; shows heightened sensitivity to food inflation similar to humans; but lacks consistent consumer price inflation model.

Conclusion: LLMs can mimic human inflation perceptions but have limitations in consistent economic modeling; the approach provides valuable methodology for evaluating LLMs in social sciences, comparing models, and assisting survey design.

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLM training packs multiple documents for computational efficiency, but the impact on model capabilities remains unexplored, particularly regarding multi-hop reasoning abilities.

Method: Investigate different document-packing strategies and their influence on latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs, including an ablation study to identify key factors.

Result: Packing improves model performance compared to training on individual documents, though at the expense of more computational resources.

Conclusion: Research deepens understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development through document-packing strategies.

Abstract: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

*Shizhuo Mao,Song Chen,Yi Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SASQ is a lightweight quantization-aware training framework that optimizes only quantization factors (not weights) for activation quantization, enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges due to their large size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Existing quantization solutions face trade-offs: dynamic quantization has high computational overhead and deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. QAT approaches suffer from weight training costs.

Method: SASQ exclusively optimizes only quantization factors without changing pre-trained weights. It adaptively truncates some outliers to reduce quantization difficulty while preserving activation distribution characteristics. This enables static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency.

Result: SASQ surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes and outperforms corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

Conclusion: SASQ provides an effective lightweight QAT framework for activation quantization that achieves superior accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency, addressing key limitations of existing quantization approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

Conclusion: Using C code as a bridge to understand assembly through synthetic data generation effectively enhances LLM performance on low-level programming language tasks, with consistent improvements across various model architectures and sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically excel at coding tasks involving high-level programming languages, as opposed to lower-level programming languages, such as assembly. We propose a synthetic data generation method named C-ing Clearly, which leverages the corresponding C code to enhance an LLM's understanding of assembly.

TL;DR: Critique of Futrell & Mahowald's framework for bridging deep learning and linguistics, arguing that focusing only on text-based LLMs limits linguistic insights and advocating for audio-based models instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors identify a limitation in Futrell & Mahowald's framework: its exclusive focus on generative text-based LLMs restricts meaningful interaction with linguistics because many important aspects of human language (prosody, intonation, speech patterns) aren't captured by written text alone.

Method: The paper presents a critical argument rather than an empirical study. It analyzes the limitations of text-only approaches and makes a theoretical case for incorporating audio-based deep learning models to better study human language phenomena.

Result: The authors conclude that audio-based models are essential for bridging deep learning and linguistics, as they can capture linguistic features that text-based models miss, enabling more comprehensive study of human language.

Conclusion: Audio-based deep learning models should play a crucial role in connecting technology-oriented deep learning systems with explanation-oriented linguistic theories, as they address the fundamental limitations of text-only approaches.

Abstract: Futrell and Mahowald present a useful framework bridging technology-oriented deep learning systems and explanation-oriented linguistic theories. Unfortunately, the target article's focus on generative text-based LLMs fundamentally limits fruitful interactions with linguistics, as many interesting questions on human language fall outside what is captured by written text. We argue that audio-based deep learning models can and should play a crucial role.

*Ying Nie,Kai Han,Hongguang Li,Hang Zhou,Tianyu Guo,Enhua Wu,Xinghao Chen,Yunhe Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VersatileFFN is a novel feed-forward network that enables flexible parameter reuse in width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget, using adaptive pathways for efficient token processing based on difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid scaling of LLMs leads to prohibitive memory costs, and existing parameter-efficient approaches like pruning and quantization only compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, hitting the representational ceiling of the base model.

Method: VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN (mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters), and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways.

Result: Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available on GitHub.

Conclusion: VersatileFFN provides a parameter-efficient approach that enhances architectural capacity within fixed parameter budgets by reusing parameters in both width and depth dimensions, with all additional capacity coming from computation rather than memory.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

*David Samuel,Lucas Georges Gabriel Charpentier*

TL;DR: Combining autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without architectural changes creates flexible language models that outperform single-objective models, achieving optimal performance across varying data repetition levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models are training-efficient but sensitive to overfitting, while masked-diffusion models are more resilient to overfitting but less efficient to train. The paper aims to combine both approaches to achieve the best of both worlds.

Method: The authors combine autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without architectural modifications. They train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition to derive the optimal ratio between both objectives.

Result: Dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds, outperforming single-objective models. The optimal ratio between objectives is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance, and combining both objectives is optimal under all evaluated settings.

Conclusion: Combining autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives creates flexible, high-performing language models that balance training efficiency with resilience to overfitting, with consistent optimal ratios across different performance targets.

Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity, hierarchical structure, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation create significant challenges for evaluating how well LLMs can interpret and utilize legal knowledge, creating a need for a standardized evaluation framework.

Method: Created VLegal-Bench with 10,450 samples through rigorous annotation pipeline where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance. The benchmark is informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy and includes tasks reflecting practical legal usage scenarios like general Q&A, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving.

Result: Established the first comprehensive benchmark for Vietnamese legal tasks, providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework with expert-validated samples grounded in authoritative legal documents.

Conclusion: VLegal-Bench provides a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nepali faces NLP challenges due to complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited high-quality corpora. Existing encoder architectures are insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation.

Method: Developed GPT-2-based model with GPT-3-inspired training strategies (optimized learning rates, batch scaling, architectural refinements). Created custom 16k BPE tokenizer on Nepali text. Pretrained on combined dataset (10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus + web-scraped news). Integrated FlashAttention for memory efficiency.

Result: After two epochs: training loss 3.168177, validation loss 3.081982, final perplexity 21.80. Model demonstrates capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

Conclusion: The developed GPT-2-based model with custom tokenizer and training strategies successfully addresses Nepali text generation challenges, showing promising results for low-resource language NLP.

Abstract: Nepali, a low-resource language spoken by over 32 million people, continues to face challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex grammar, agglutinative morphology, and limited availability of high-quality corpora. Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.

TL;DR: JMMMU-Pro is a Japanese multimodal benchmark combining images and text into single images, created using Vibe Benchmark Construction with generative AI and human verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more rigorous evaluation tool for Japanese multimodal understanding that requires integrated visual-textual perception, extending from previous benchmarks like MMMU and JMMMU.

Method: Vibe Benchmark Construction: uses image generative models (Nano Banana Pro) to create candidate visual questions, with human verification and prompt adjustment for quality control.

Result: All open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, demonstrating its challenging nature as an important benchmark for guiding future open-source community efforts.

Conclusion: JMMMU-Pro provides rigorous evaluation for Japanese LMM capabilities, and Vibe Benchmark Construction offers efficient guidelines for future image-based VQA benchmark development.

Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

### [127] [TiME: Tiny Monolingual Encoders for Efficient NLP Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14645)
*David Schulmeister,Valentin Hartmann,Lars Klein,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) are small, efficient language models trained with modern techniques like distillation to address the inefficiency of large models for specific NLP tasks, offering better performance-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large general-purpose language models are inefficient for many NLP applications that require only specific capabilities. They have high latency, slow throughput, excessive energy consumption, and sustainability concerns, making them unsuitable for real-time applications or battery-powered devices.

Method: Train small monolingual models using modern training techniques like distillation, including distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers and distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings. Support for low-resource languages is included.

Result: TiME models demonstrate improved trade-off between benchmark performance and efficiency metrics (throughput, latency, energy consumption) across a range of common NLP tasks. The distillation techniques prove effective for creating efficient small models.

Conclusion: Small, specialized models like TiME offer a practical solution for efficiency-critical NLP applications, providing better performance-efficiency balance than large models while supporting modern training techniques and low-resource languages.

Abstract: Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

### [128] [Fast and Accurate Causal Parallel Decoding using Jacobi Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14681)
*Lanxiang Hu,Siqi Kou,Yichao Fu,Samyam Rajbhandari,Tajana Rosing,Yuxiong He,Zhijie Deng,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Jacobi Forcing is a progressive distillation method that transforms autoregressive models into efficient parallel decoders, achieving 3.8-4.0x speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion LLMs for parallel decoding suffer from limited speedup due to pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch - masked data distribution differs from pretraining data, and bidirectional attention conflicts with causal priors learned during pretraining, preventing exact KV cache reuse.

Method: Jacobi Forcing: progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference properties. Also introduces multi-block decoding with rejection recycling for higher token acceptance per iteration.

Result: Jacobi Forcing Model achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal performance loss. Multi-block decoding with rejection recycling enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup.

Conclusion: Jacobi Forcing effectively addresses the pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch in parallel decoding models, enabling significant inference acceleration while maintaining AR-level generation quality through progressive distillation and trajectory-based optimization techniques.

Abstract: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Spoken DialogSum is the first dataset aligning raw conversational audio with factual and emotion-rich summaries plus paralinguistic labels, enabling emotion-aware spoken dialogue summarization research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by lack of data linking speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. Existing datasets don't align raw audio with both factual and emotion-focused summaries.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers/back-channels and tags utterances with emotion, pitch, speaking rate; 2) Expressive TTS synthesizes speech from tagged scripts aligned with paralinguistic labels.

Result: Created Spoken DialogSum with 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each with factual and emotion-focused summaries plus utterance-level speaker age, gender, emotion labels. Audio-LLM baseline shows 28% relative ROUGE-L improvement over cascaded ASR-LLM system.

Conclusion: Spoken DialogSum enables emotion-aware spoken dialogue summarization research. End-to-end speech modeling (Audio-LLM) significantly outperforms cascaded systems, confirming value of direct speech processing for emotional summary generation.

Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMGR is a new evaluation framework that assesses video and image foundation models on five reasoning abilities (physical, logical, 3D spatial, 2D spatial, temporal) across three domains, revealing significant performance gaps in abstract reasoning and spatial planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video foundation models focus on perceptual quality but overlook reasoning failures like violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. Existing metrics like FVD don't capture whether models can serve as reliable world simulators.

Method: MMGR introduces a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities, applied across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). It uses fine-grained metrics requiring holistic correctness across video and image generation.

Result: Benchmarking leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image) reveals strong performance gaps: moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks, but poor performance on Abstract Reasoning (below 10% accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggles with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings.

Conclusion: Current models have key limitations including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR provides a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

*Md. Tanzim Ferdous,Naeem Ahsan Chowdhury,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers created a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset with over 54,000 articles from diverse sources (blogs, newspapers) to address the limitation of existing news-only datasets and enable more adaptable summarization systems for real-world Bangla content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bangla summarization research focuses mainly on news articles with fixed writing styles, which fails to handle the diverse real-world Bangla content from blogs, newspapers, and social media. There's a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand varied Bangla content more quickly.

Method: Developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources including blogs (Cinegolpo) and newspapers (Samakal, The Business Standard). The dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. Established baselines by training and evaluating with several deep learning and transfer learning models including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small.

Result: The dataset provides greater adaptability and practical relevance compared to single-domain resources. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing.

Conclusion: This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages like Bangla, addressing the gap in diverse content summarization capabilities.

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

TL;DR: Blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor MIMO-OFDM channel measurements without location labels, achieving 0.68m localization error and 3.3% beam map reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio map construction requires extensive location-labeled data which is costly and impractical. There's a need for methods that can work without explicit location labels in real-world scenarios.

Method: 1) Proves CSI under NLOS exhibits spatial continuity, allowing derivation of CSI-distance metric proportional to physical distance. 2) Shows CRLB of localization error vanishes asymptotically for rectilinear trajectories. 3) Develops spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes LOS/NLOS conditions, and recovers user trajectories.

Result: Experiments on ray-tracing dataset demonstrate average localization error of 0.68 meters and beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.

Conclusion: The proposed blind radio map construction framework successfully infers user trajectories without location labels, achieving accurate localization and beam map reconstruction, making it practical for real-world indoor wireless applications.

Abstract: Radio maps enable intelligent wireless applications by capturing the spatial distribution of channel characteristics. However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adjudicator is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a Knowledge Graph and multi-agent LLM architecture to automatically identify and correct label noise in training data, achieving near-perfect F1-score on benchmark data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy training labels degrade ML system performance and erode user trust in high-stakes industrial applications, creating a critical need for automated label verification systems.

Method: Constructs a dynamic Knowledge Graph to unify item context, then uses a "Council of Agents" multi-agent LLM architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on label validity, with KG-informed override logic.

Result: Achieved 0.99 F1-score on AlleNoise benchmark, significantly outperforming single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and non-KG council (0.59 F1), with perfect recall on complex structural errors.

Conclusion: Adjudicator provides a robust, explainable system for automated high-precision data verification, serving as proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.

Abstract: The performance of production machine learning systems is fundamentally limited by the quality of their training data. In high-stakes industrial applications, noisy labels can degrade performance and erode user trust. This paper presents Adjudicator, a system that addresses the critical data mining challenge of automatically identifying and correcting label noise and has been validated for production deployment. Adjudicator models this as a neuro-symbolic task, first constructing a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) to unify item context. This KG then informs a "Council of Agents," a novel multi-agent Large Language Model architecture where specialized agents debate and vote on a label's validity. We validate our system on a 1,000-item balanced subset of the AlleNoise benchmark. Our KG-informed model achieves a 0.99 F1-score, significantly outperforming a single-LLM baseline (0.48 F1) and a non-KG council (0.59 F1). Our analysis reveals this is due to a Precision, achieved by a novel override logic that uses the KG to perfectly identify complex, structural errors (complete Recall) -- a class of errors that baselines fail to find. This result demonstrates a robust and explainable system for automated, high-precision data verification, serving as a vital proof-of-concept for generating golden datasets in strictly governed industrial environments.

Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as autonomous agents but their ability to coordinate in distributed systems remains poorly understood. There's a need to evaluate LLM reasoning in distributed symmetry breaking and meta-cognitive thinking scenarios.

Method: LoopBench focuses on coloring odd cycle graphs (C3, C5, C11) with limited colors, where deterministic, non-communicating agents fail in infinite loops. A strategy passing mechanism is implemented as consistent memory to test LLM reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face reliability issues in regulated industries due to instability, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations, and performance variability. Current stabilization methods like RLHF and supervised fine-tuning are expensive, human-intensive, and not easily scalable.

Method: An AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes instability patterns in LLM outputs. Uses human-AI synergy combining automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with targeted human validation.

Result: The framework introduces stability-specific annotation categories (semantic consistency, factual correctness, logical coherence) enabling continuous model calibration and robustness enhancement through feedback loops.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses LLM reliability challenges in regulated industries by creating a scalable, sustainable annotation pipeline that ensures feedback reliability and ethical integrity while overcoming limitations of current expensive human-intensive methods.

Abstract: LLM implementations are failing in highly regulated industries owing to instability issues, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations and performance variability, especially in workflows. These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).

*Fatemeh Lotfi,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Meta-HRL framework for O-RAN resource allocation and network slicing, achieving 19.8% efficiency improvement over baselines with faster adaptation and better QoS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern applications need adaptive wireless networks; O-RAN with RIC enables dynamic resource management, but existing AI methods struggle with unpredictable dynamic conditions.

Method: Adaptive Meta-HRL framework inspired by MAML with hierarchical control: high-level allocates resources across slices, low-level agents handle intra-slice scheduling; adaptive meta-update weights tasks by temporal difference error variance.

Result: 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency vs baseline RL/meta-RL; faster adaptation, higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, mMTC slices; up to 40% faster adaptation; consistent performance with scale.

Conclusion: Meta-HRL framework effectively addresses dynamic O-RAN resource management with theoretical convergence guarantees and practical performance improvements across diverse network scenarios.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ValuePilot: A value-driven framework for personalized AI decision-making that learns human value preferences to enable consistent, interpretable behavior across novel scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems expand into real-world applications, there's a critical need for personalized decision-making that goes beyond task completion or collective alignment. Current approaches driven by external rewards lack interpretability and fail to adapt to individual user value preferences.

Method: ValuePilot framework with two phases: 1) Dataset Generation Toolkit (DGT) creates diverse, value-annotated scenarios through human-LLM collaboration; 2) Decision-Making Module (DMM) learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences for context-sensitive decisions.

Result: DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines (GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, Llama-3.1-70b) in aligning with human action choices on previously unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: Value-driven decision-making is an effective and extensible engineering pathway toward building interpretable, personalized AI agents that can act consistently across diverse contexts.

Abstract: Personalized decision-making is essential for human-AI interaction, enabling AI agents to act in alignment with individual users' value preferences. As AI systems expand into real-world applications, adapting to personalized values beyond task completion or collective alignment has become a critical challenge. We address this by proposing a value-driven approach to personalized decision-making. Human values serve as stable, transferable signals that support consistent and generalizable behavior across contexts. Compared to task-oriented paradigms driven by external rewards and incentives, value-driven decision-making enhances interpretability and enables agents to act appropriately even in novel scenarios. We introduce ValuePilot, a two-phase framework consisting of a dataset generation toolkit (DGT) and a decision-making module (DMM). DGT constructs diverse, value-annotated scenarios from a human-LLM collaborative pipeline. DMM learns to evaluate actions based on personal value preferences, enabling context-sensitive, individualized decisions. When evaluated on previously unseen scenarios, DMM outperforms strong LLM baselines, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2-flash, and Llama-3.1-70b, in aligning with human action choices. Our results demonstrate that value-driven decision-making is an effective and extensible engineering pathway toward building interpretable, personalized AI agents.

### [139] [Compressed Causal Reasoning: Quantization and GraphRAG Effects on Interventional and Counterfactual Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13725)
*Steve Nwaiwu,Nipat Jongsawat,Anucha Tungkasthan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Causal reasoning in LLMs remains surprisingly robust under 4-bit quantization (NF4), with less than 1% overall degradation, though interventional queries are most sensitive to precision loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM deployment shifts to edge and resource-constrained environments requiring quantized models (INT8, NF4), there's a critical need to understand how precision reduction affects formal causal reasoning across Pearl's Causal Ladder levels.

Method: Systematic evaluation using 3000-sample stratified CLadder benchmark across Pearl's three causal levels; experiments on CRASS benchmark; Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation with ground truth causal graphs; comparing INT8 and NF4 quantization on Llama 3 8B.

Result: NF4 shows <1% overall degradation; interventional queries (rung 2) most sensitive; counterfactual reasoning (rung 3) stable but with heterogeneous weaknesses; CRASS shows near identical performance across precisions; Graph RAG improves NF4 interventional accuracy by +1.7%.

Conclusion: Causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to 4-bit quantization; graph-structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning; current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness; provides empirical guidance for deploying efficient causal AI systems.

Abstract: Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.

### [140] [State-Dependent Refusal and Learned Incapacity in RLHF-Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13762)
*TK Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing LLM behavioral selectivity in long interactions, identifying a pattern of "learned incapacity" where models show normal performance in non-sensitive domains but functional refusal in policy-sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard quantitative benchmarks don't capture behavioral patterns that emerge during extended LLM interactions, particularly policy-linked behavioral selectivity where models may show different behaviors in sensitive vs. non-sensitive domains.

Method: Qualitative case-study methodology using an 86-turn dialogue session to audit behavioral selectivity; operationalizes three response regimes (Normal Performance, Functional Refusal, Meta-Narrative); introduces "learned incapacity" as a behavioral descriptor for selective withholding without implying intentionality.

Result: The same model showed consistent asymmetry: Normal Performance in broad non-sensitive domains but repeated Functional Refusal in provider- or policy-sensitive domains; Meta-Narrative role-framing narratives tended to co-occur with refusals in sensitive contexts.

Conclusion: Proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates "learned incapacity" as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across different users and models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose tools, yet extended interaction can reveal behavioral patterns not captured by standard quantitative benchmarks. We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.

### [141] [Mathematics and Coding are Universal AI Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13764)
*Przemyslaw Chojecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mathematics and coding form dense subspaces in AI agent evaluation space, with formal proof systems enabling spectrally stable self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the special role of mathematics and coding in evaluating AI agents, particularly how formal verification enables stable self-improvement regimes.

Method: Defined Mathematics Fiber concept, used GVU dynamics with formal proof kernels (Lean, Coq), proved density theorem under uniform tightness and Lipschitz conditions.

Result: Coding alone is universal (dense in evaluation space), while pure mathematics is not; mathematics provides spectral privilege rather than expressive completeness.

Conclusion: Mathematics and coding serve as "universal coordinates" for AI evaluation, with formal mathematics being a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement.

Abstract: We study the special role of mathematics and coding inside the moduli space of psychometric batteries for AI agents. Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.

### [142] [Semantic Grounding Index: Geometric Bounds on Context Engagement in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13771)
*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantic Grounding Index (SGI) - a geometric metric using angular distances in embedding space to detect hallucinations in RAG systems. Hallucinated responses stay close to questions rather than moving toward retrieved contexts, showing "semantic laziness."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computationally efficient, theoretically grounded method for identifying hallucinated responses in RAG systems by analyzing geometric patterns in embedding space, specifically the angular relationships between questions, contexts, and responses.

Method: Define SGI as ratio of angular distances from response to question vs context on unit hypersphere. Use spherical triangle inequality to derive theoretical properties. Test on HaluEval dataset (n=5,000) across five embedding models. Analyze discriminative power across different angular separations and response characteristics.

Result: Large effect sizes (Cohen's d 0.92-1.28) across models with high cross-model correlation (r=0.85). Effect size increases with question-context angular separation (d=0.61 to 1.27). Excellent performance on long responses (d=2.05) and short questions (d=1.22). Calibration shows SGI scores can serve as probability estimates (ECE=0.10).

Conclusion: SGI provides efficient infrastructure for identifying responses needing verification in RAG deployments. It measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy (shown by poor performance on TruthfulQA). The method leverages geometric patterns in embedding space to detect "semantic laziness" in hallucinated responses.

Abstract: When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.

### [143] [EvoLattice: Persistent Internal-Population Evolution through Multi-Alternative Quality-Diversity Graph Representations for LLM-Guided Program Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13857)
*Kamer Ali Yuksel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoLattice is a framework that represents populations of programs/agents as a directed acyclic graph where nodes store multiple persistent alternatives, enabling combinatorial search without duplication while guaranteeing structural correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based evolution methods use overwrite-based mutations that discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore brittle search spaces prone to structural failure.

Method: EvoLattice represents candidate programs/agents as a DAG where each node stores multiple persistent alternatives. Each valid path defines a distinct executable candidate. It enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation, provides dense feedback for LLM-guided mutation/recombination/pruning, and uses deterministic self-repair to guarantee structural correctness.

Result: EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods in program synthesis tasks (proxy and optimizer meta-learning).

Conclusion: EvoLattice's multi-alternative representation enables quality-diversity optimization dynamics to emerge implicitly, overcoming limitations of single-candidate overwrite-based approaches while preserving successful components.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

*Sindhuja Madabushi,Dawood Wasif,Jin-Hee Cho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MURIM is a multi-dimensional reputation-based incentive mechanism for federated learning that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness to prevent malicious clients from earning undeserved rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning faces challenges including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring meaningful data contributions to the global model.

Method: Proposes MURIM (MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism) that allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module.

Result: Experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets show MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, enabling participants to share model updates instead of raw data. However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings.

*Yang Cao,Yubin Chen,Xuyang Guo,Zhao Song,Song Yue,Jiahao Zhang,Jiale Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Benchmark evaluation of four frontier LLMs (GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, Grok-4) on graduate-level randomized algorithms proofs shows top models achieve ~66% accuracy while others lag at ~40%, revealing significant variance in mathematical reasoning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs show promise in mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery, there's a need for rigorous evaluation of their baseline capabilities on canonical graduate-level mathematical theory to understand their true reasoning abilities.

Method: Comprehensive benchmark testing four frontier models on the classic Randomized Algorithms textbook by Motwani and Raghavan, requiring generation of formal LaTeX proofs for lemmas and exercises spanning the curriculum.

Result: Top-tier models (Gemini and Claude) achieved approximately 66% accuracy, demonstrating robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, while other models showed significantly lower consistency around 40%. Qualitative analysis revealed differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure.

Conclusion: Frontier models have reached proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, but significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation, highlighting the need for continued evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in automated mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery. Georgiev, G${ó}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].
  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

*Ge Yan,Chung-En Sun,Tsui-Wei,Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReflCtrl framework uses representation engineering to control self-reflection in LLMs, reducing redundant reflections by up to 33.6% while maintaining performance, with reflection behavior correlating with internal uncertainty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While self-reflection in LLMs with Chain-of-Thought reasoning improves performance, it significantly increases inference costs. The authors aim to understand and control self-reflection behavior to reduce redundant reflections and optimize inference efficiency.

Method: The ReflCtrl framework segments reasoning into steps, identifies reflection steps, extracts a reflection direction in latent space, and implements stepwise steering to control reflection frequency through representation engineering.

Result: Experiments show reflections are often redundant, especially in stronger models, with up to 33.6% token savings while preserving performance. Reflection behavior correlates strongly with internal uncertainty signals, suggesting self-reflection is controlled by model uncertainty.

Conclusion: Self-reflection in LLMs can be efficiently controlled through representation engineering, reducing inference costs without performance loss. The correlation with uncertainty signals provides insight into the mechanisms behind self-reflection behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, including mathematics, coding, and general reasoning. A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DTop-p MoE introduces a dynamic Top-p routing mechanism with PI controller for sparsity control and adaptive resource allocation across tokens and layers, outperforming standard Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Top-k routing imposes uniform sparsity ignoring token difficulty, while existing Top-p implementations use fixed global thresholds leading to uncontrolled computational costs and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Method: Proposes DTop-p MoE with: 1) PI Controller that dynamically adjusts probability threshold to maintain target sparsity, 2) Dynamic routing normalization adapting layer-wise routing logits for distinct expert-selection patterns with global threshold.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLMs and Diffusion Transformers show DTop-p consistently outperforms Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines, maintains precise sparsity control, and adaptively allocates resources across tokens/layers.

Conclusion: DTop-p offers robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training with strong scaling properties across expert granularity, capacity, model size, and dataset size, solving limitations of existing routing strategies.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures effectively scale model capacity by activating only a subset of experts for each input token. However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.

Conclusion: Natural language-based world modeling is a viable alternative to pixel-space approaches for GUI agents, with MobileWorldBench and MobileWorld dataset enabling better evaluation and improvement of VLM world modeling capabilities.

Abstract: World models have shown great utility in improving the task performance of embodied agents. While prior work largely focuses on pixel-space world models, these approaches face practical limitations in GUI settings, where predicting complex visual elements in future states is often difficult. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of world modeling for GUI agents, where state transitions are described in natural language rather than predicting raw pixels. First, we introduce MobileWorldBench, a benchmark that evaluates the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to function as world models for mobile GUI agents. Second, we release MobileWorld, a large-scale dataset consisting of 1.4M samples, that significantly improves the world modeling capabilities of VLMs. Finally, we propose a novel framework that integrates VLM world models into the planning framework of mobile agents, demonstrating that semantic world models can directly benefit mobile agents by improving task success rates.

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks 20 open-source Small Language Models for dairy farming decision support, evaluating their performance under farm-realistic computing constraints using an agentic AI system with five task-specific agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have potential for dairy farming decision support but cloud-based access is impractical for farm environments. Lightweight alternatives that can run locally on farm hardware are needed to address computational constraints and privacy concerns.

Method: Benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models from HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Developed an agentic AI system with five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation. Used two-phase evaluation with initial screening (5 questions) followed by comprehensive testing (30 questions across task categories).

Result: Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most task categories, though showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. This is the first work explicitly evaluating SLM feasibility for dairy farming decision-making with emphasis on privacy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SLMs show promise for practical deployment in dairy farming, but challenges remain and fine-tuning is needed to refine performance on dairy-specific questions. The work demonstrates feasibility of lightweight alternatives to cloud-based LLMs for farm environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) hold potential to support dairy scholars and farmers by supporting decision-making and broadening access to knowledge for stakeholders with limited technical expertise. However, the substantial computational demand restricts access to LLM almost exclusively through cloud-based service, which makes LLM-based decision support tools impractical for dairy farming. To address this gap, lightweight alternatives capable of running locally on farm hardware are required. In this work, we benchmarked 20 open-source Small Language Models (SLM) available on HuggingFace under farm-realistic computing constraints. Building on our prior work, we developed an agentic AI system that integrates five task-specific agents: literature search, web search, SQL database interaction, NoSQL database interaction, and graph generation following predictive models. Evaluation was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, five test questions were used for the initial screening to identify models capable of following basic dairy-related instructions and performing reliably in a compute-constrained environment. Models that passed this preliminary stage were then evaluated using 30 questions (five per task category mentioned above, plus one category addressing integrity and misconduct) in phase two. In results, Qwen-4B achieved superior performance across most of task categories, although showed unstable effectiveness in NoSQL database interactions through PySpark. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly evaluating the feasibility of SLM as engines for dairy farming decision-making, with central emphases on privacy and computational efficiency. While results highlight the promise of SLM-assisted tools for practical deployment in dairy farming, challenges remain, and fine-tuning is still needed to refine SLM performance in dairy-specific questions.

### [150] [Intention Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Dynamic Routing for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14048)
*Shen Li,Li Huang,Shaoxiong Zhan,Weifeng Sun,Tao Yin,Zhongxin Liu,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RoutingGen is a difficulty-aware routing framework for code generation that dynamically chooses between few-shot prompting for simple tasks and Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT) for complex tasks, achieving SOTA performance while reducing token usage by 46.37%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoT prompting methods have two limitations: 1) uniform application causes overthinking on simple tasks, and 2) lack of intention abstraction in code generation, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting global problem objectives like algorithmic design and efficiency.

Method: RoutingGen is a difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies. For simple tasks, it uses few-shot prompting; for complex tasks, it invokes Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which guides models to capture task intention including core algorithmic logic and time complexity.

Result: Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average. ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: RoutingGen effectively addresses limitations of uniform CoT prompting by dynamically routing tasks based on difficulty, conserving computational resources while improving performance through intention-focused reasoning for complex code generation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities and have shown great potential in code generation. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenDataArena (ODA) is an open platform for benchmarking post-training data quality for LLMs, addressing the opacity in current data evaluation practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM development suffers from a data opacity problem - while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data used for post-training remains a black box with unclear composition, provenance, and systematic evaluation, hindering reproducibility and understanding of data-behavior relationships.

Method: ODA introduces a comprehensive ecosystem with four pillars: 1) unified training-evaluation pipeline for fair comparisons across models and domains, 2) multi-dimensional scoring framework for data quality assessment across tens of axes, 3) interactive data lineage explorer for visualizing dataset genealogy, and 4) fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring.

Result: Extensive experiments covering 120+ training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by 600+ training runs and 40 million processed data points, revealed non-trivial insights including trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and genealogical relationships across datasets.

Conclusion: ODA aims to shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI by democratizing access to high-quality data evaluation tools and enabling rigorous studies on data mixing laws and strategic composition of foundation models.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.

*Junjie Ma,Jinlong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR introduces RL-based dynamic draft trees for speculative sampling, using offline reinforcement learning to dynamically decide when to call draft models, achieving 3.17x-4.82x speedup over auto-regressive decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative sampling methods use a fixed number of calls to draft models, lacking flexibility and efficiency. This leads to redundant computations and suboptimal token generation.

Method: Formulates draft tree generation as Markov Decision Process (MDP), uses offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model for real-time decisions on draft model calls, creating dynamic draft trees.

Result: Achieves 3.17x-4.82x speedup over auto-regressive decoding across three LLMs and four tasks, demonstrating significant inference acceleration.

Conclusion: RADAR effectively accelerates LLM inference through RL-based dynamic draft trees, providing flexible and efficient speculative sampling with substantial speed improvements.

Abstract: Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has emerged as an effective solution to this problem, however, the number of the calls to the draft model for generating candidate tokens in speculative sampling is a preset hyperparameter, lacking flexibility. To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

TL;DR: A structured framework for multi-agent system search using fixed composable components outperforms LLM-based approaches on most benchmarks while being more cost-efficient and interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior approaches to automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems rely on LLM-based free-form search over code space, which lacks structure and may be inefficient. The authors aim to develop a more structured, cost-efficient, and interpretable approach.

Method: Proposes a structured framework that explores the multi-agent system space through a fixed set of simple, composable components, rather than using LLM-based free-form generation.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across mathematics and question answering domains. Also achieves more cost-efficient search and generates modular, interpretable systems with simpler logic.

Conclusion: A structured approach using fixed composable components can be more effective than LLM-based free-form search for automatic multi-agent system design, offering better performance, cost efficiency, and interpretability.

Abstract: Automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems has recently emerged as a key focus in agentic AI research. Several prior approaches have relied on LLM-based free-form search over the code space. In this work, we propose a more structured framework that explores the same space through a fixed set of simple, composable components. We show that, despite lacking the generative flexibility of LLMs during the candidate generation stage, our method outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across two domains: mathematics and question answering. Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining data quality across thousands of remote streamflow sensors is labor-intensive despite millions of annual observations, creating a need for automated quality control systems that can handle continental-scale monitoring networks.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations to learn hydrological representations, 2) fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. Uses hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) with hierarchical normalization to handle six orders of magnitude in discharge.

Result: Achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction (36.3% improvement over existing methods) on held-out synthetic tests with 799 stations and 18 expert-validated anomaly types. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Canadian stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization.

Conclusion: HydroGEM provides an effective foundation model for streamflow quality control with strong generalization capabilities, designed for human-in-the-loop workflows where outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review rather than autonomous corrections.

Abstract: Real-time streamflow monitoring networks generate millions of observations annually, yet maintaining data quality across thousands of remote sensors remains labor-intensive. We introduce HydroGEM (Hydrological Generalizable Encoder for Monitoring), a foundation model for continental-scale streamflow quality control. HydroGEM uses two-stage training: self-supervised pretraining on 6.03 million sequences from 3,724 USGS stations learns hydrological representations, followed by fine-tuning with synthetic anomalies for detection and reconstruction. A hybrid TCN-Transformer architecture (14.2M parameters) captures local temporal patterns and long-range dependencies, while hierarchical normalization handles six orders of magnitude in discharge. On held-out synthetic tests comprising 799 stations with 18 expert-validated anomaly types, HydroGEM achieves F1 = 0.792 for detection and 68.7% reconstruction-error reduction, a 36.3% improvement over existing methods. Zero-shot transfer to 100 Environment and Climate Change Canada stations yields F1 = 0.586, exceeding all baselines and demonstrating cross-national generalization. The model maintains consistent detection across correction magnitudes and aligns with operational seasonal patterns. HydroGEM is designed for human-in-the-loop workflows - outputs are quality control suggestions requiring expert review, not autonomous corrections.

TL;DR: Ophiuchus is a tool-augmented medical MLLM framework that enables dynamic visual region focusing for precise medical diagnosis through tool-integrated reasoning and a three-stage training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical MLLMs struggle with complex tasks requiring dynamic, iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions for precise grounding and diagnosis. There's a need for systems that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning.

Method: A three-stage training strategy: (1) cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data for basic tool selection and adaptation, (2) self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and tool output revisiting, and (3) Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert diagnostic behavior.

Result: Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source state-of-the-art methods across diverse medical benchmarks including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation.

Conclusion: The framework illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning, with datasets, codes, and trained models to be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent reasoning based medical MLLMs have made progress in generating step by step textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on fine-grained visual regions to achieve precise grounding and diagnosis. We introduce Ophiuchus, a versatile, tool-augmented framework that equips an MLLM to (i) decide when additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine where to probe and ground within the medical image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved, multimodal chain of thought. In contrast to prior approaches limited by the performance ceiling of specialized tools, Ophiuchus integrates the model's inherent grounding and perception capabilities with external tools, thereby fostering higher-level reasoning. The core of our method is a three-stage training strategy: cold-start training with tool-integrated reasoning data to achieve basic tool selection and adaptation for inspecting key regions; self-reflection fine-tuning to strengthen reflective reasoning and encourage revisiting tool outputs; and Agentic Tool Reinforcement Learning to directly optimize task-specific rewards and emulate expert-like diagnostic behavior. Extensive experiments show that Ophiuchus consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods across diverse medical benchmarks, including VQA, detection, and reasoning-based segmentation. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with images" through tool-integrated reasoning. Datasets, codes, and trained models will be released publicly.

*Aneesha Fernando,Surangika Ranathunga,Kristin Stock,Raj Prasanna,Christopher B. Jones*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs fine-tuned with QLoRA outperform traditional methods for georeferencing complex biodiversity locality descriptions, achieving 65% accuracy within 10km radius across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional georeferencing methods struggle with relative spatial descriptions common in biodiversity records, creating demand for automated solutions to handle complex locality narratives.

Method: Identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned LLMs using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on multi-region, multi-language biodiversity datasets.

Result: Outperformed existing baselines with average 65% of records within 10km radius; best results: 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km for New York state data.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong potential for accurate georeferencing of complex locality descriptions, particularly effective for lengthy, intricate biodiversity narratives.

Abstract: Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.

Motivation: Formal, automated theorem proving has been a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring new approaches to improve theorem proving capabilities.

Method: Uses specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler propositions. Features multi-agent architecture coordinating autoformalization, proof generation, decomposition, and recursive proof. Extends Kimina Lean Server with AST parsing for automated recursive proof decomposition.

Result: Achieves 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F benchmark without decomposition, with significant improvement when decomposition is added.

Conclusion: The system (goedels-poetry) provides an effective approach to automated theorem proving through language models and recursive decomposition, with open-source implementation available for adaptation and extension.

Abstract: Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.

*Georgios Bouchouras,Dimitrios Doumanas,Andreas Soularidis,Konstantinos Kotis,George A. Vouros*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate basic Parkinson's Disease monitoring ontologies but require human collaboration for comprehensive, accurate results. Hybrid approaches like X-HCOME and SimX-HCOME+ show significant improvements through human-LLM collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies for Parkinson's Disease monitoring, and if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. The paper aims to assess LLM effectiveness in automated ontology development and the enhancement potential through human collaboration.

Method: Four methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompts, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME (hybrid human-LLM approach), and SimX-HCOME+ (continuous human supervision with iterative refinement). The study compares autonomous LLM ontology generation with human-LLM collaborative approaches.

Result: LLMs (OS and CoT) can autonomously construct basic PD monitoring ontologies but produce incomplete outputs requiring substantial human refinement. X-HCOME showed significant improvements, creating ontologies very similar to expert-built ones. SimX-HCOME+ produced the most comprehensive and accurate ontologies through continuous human supervision and iterative refinement.

Conclusion: Human-LLM collaboration significantly advances ontology engineering, especially in complex domains like Parkinson's Disease. While LLMs show promise in autonomous ontology generation, they require human expertise for comprehensive results. Future research should focus on developing specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+. The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.
  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.
  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.
  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.
  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MeG proposes a massive knowledge editing approach for LLMs using dynamic weight neurons generated by diffusion models to enable large-scale edits while maintaining reliability, generality, and locality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge editing methods struggle with large-scale modifications while maintaining key metrics (Reliability, Generality, Locality) - there's a need for efficient, scalable editing techniques that don't require full retraining.

Method: Attaches dynamic weight neurons to specific LLM layers and uses diffusion models to conditionally generate neuron weights based on input queries, enabling large-scale editing with minimal architectural changes.

Result: MeG significantly outperforms existing knowledge editing methods across Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics, with particularly large improvements in Locality scores.

Conclusion: The MeG approach provides an effective solution for large-scale knowledge editing in LLMs, demonstrating superior performance through dynamic weight generation and minimal architectural intervention.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PortAgent is an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that automates VDS transfer across container terminals by using virtual experts and few-shot learning, eliminating specialist dependency and reducing data needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) have low transferability across Automated Container Terminals due to high reliance on port specialists, large terminal-specific data requirements, and time-consuming manual deployment processes.

Method: PortAgent uses a Virtual Expert Team (VET) with four LLM-based experts (Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, Debugger) that learn VDS-domain knowledge through few-shot example learning. It employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for example retrieval and establishes an automatic VDS design workflow with self-correction loops inspired by LLM Reflexion framework.

Result: The proposed system eliminates the need for port operations specialists, reduces data requirements, and enables fast deployment of VDS across different terminals.

Conclusion: PortAgent demonstrates that LLM-driven agents can effectively automate VDS transfer workflows, overcoming traditional limitations of specialist dependency, high data demands, and slow manual deployment processes in container terminal operations.

Abstract: Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created

Conclusion: This study significantly lowers the entry barrier for computational seismology, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

Abstract: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

### [163] [Context-Picker: Dynamic context selection using multi-stage reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14465)
*Siyuan Zhu,Chengdong Xu,Kaiqiang Ke,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Context-Picker is a reinforcement learning framework for long-context QA that selects minimal sufficient evidence sets instead of using similarity-based ranking, improving answer accuracy with reduced context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches in long-context QA struggle with determining optimal context amount - too little misses critical info, too much adds noise. This is especially problematic for factoid questions needing few specific evidence pieces.

Method: Two-stage RL framework: recall-oriented stage prioritizes reasoning chain coverage, then precision-oriented stage aggressively prunes redundancy. Uses offline evidence distillation via Leave-One-Out to mine minimal sufficient sets for dense supervision.

Result: Outperforms strong RAG baselines on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths.

Conclusion: Shifting from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection via reasoning-aware framework significantly improves LCQA performance. Key contributions: coarse-to-fine optimization, redundancy-aware reward shaping, and rationale-guided format.

Abstract: In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines "minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.

### [164] [Model-First Reasoning LLM Agents: Reducing Hallucinations through Explicit Problem Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14474)
*Annu Rana,Gaurav Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MFR introduces explicit problem modeling before planning, reducing constraint violations and improving solution quality across multiple domains compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing approaches like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct lack explicit problem representation, relying on implicit state tracking.

Method: Model-First Reasoning (MFR) is a two-phase paradigm where the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem (defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints) before generating a solution plan.

Result: Across multiple planning domains (medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, procedural synthesis), MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies confirm the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains.

Conclusion: Many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations. Explicit modeling is a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents, addressing fundamental weaknesses in current LLM planning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

*Zitian Gao,Lynx Chen,Yihao Xiao,He Xing,Ran Tao,Haoming Luo,Joey Zhou,Bryan Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Universal Transformers' performance gains on reasoning tasks come from recurrent inductive bias and Transformer's nonlinear components, not complex architecture. The proposed Universal Reasoning Model (URM) enhances UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation, achieving SOTA results on ARC-AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Universal Transformers (UTs) show strong performance on complex reasoning tasks like ARC-AGI and Sudoku, the specific sources of their performance gains remain unclear and underexplored. The authors aim to systematically analyze UT variants to understand what truly drives their reasoning capabilities.

Method: The authors systematically analyze UT variants and discover that improvements primarily come from recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer architecture. Based on this finding, they propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation techniques.

Result: URM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ARC-AGI benchmarks: 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2. This demonstrates substantial improvement in reasoning performance compared to previous approaches.

Conclusion: The key insight is that UT's reasoning performance gains come from fundamental architectural properties (recurrent inductive bias and nonlinear components) rather than elaborate designs. The proposed URM successfully leverages these insights with simple enhancements to achieve SOTA results on complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: AnimaMimic is a framework that animates static 3D meshes using motion priors from video diffusion models, automatically creating rigged animations with physically plausible soft-tissue dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D animation is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, requiring manual rigging and keyframing. While video diffusion models show impressive motion generation in 2D, they lack explicit 3D structure needed for animation pipelines.

Method: The framework starts with a static 3D mesh, synthesizes monocular animation video using video diffusion priors, automatically constructs skeleton with skinning weights, refines joint parameters through differentiable rendering and video-based supervision, and integrates differentiable simulation for physically grounded soft-tissue dynamics.

Result: Produces physically plausible, temporally coherent, and artist-editable motion sequences that bridge video diffusion creativity with 3D rigged animation structural control, integrating seamlessly into standard animation pipelines.

Conclusion: AnimaMimic successfully bridges the gap between 2D video diffusion motion generation and 3D animation, enabling automated creation of realistic, editable animations with physical realism.

Abstract: Creating realistic 3D animation remains a time-consuming and expertise-dependent process, requiring manual rigging, keyframing, and fine-tuning of complex motions. Meanwhile, video diffusion models have recently demonstrated remarkable motion imagination in 2D, generating dynamic and visually coherent motion from text or image prompts. However, their results lack explicit 3D structure and cannot be directly used for animation or simulation. We present AnimaMimic, a framework that animates static 3D meshes using motion priors learned from video diffusion models. Starting from an input mesh, AnimaMimic synthesizes a monocular animation video, automatically constructs a skeleton with skinning weights, and refines joint parameters through differentiable rendering and video-based supervision. To further enhance realism, we integrate a differentiable simulation module that refines mesh deformation through physically grounded soft-tissue dynamics. Our method bridges the creativity of video diffusion and the structural control of 3D rigged animation, producing physically plausible, temporally coherent, and artist-editable motion sequences that integrate seamlessly into standard animation pipelines.

TL;DR: AMID is an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion method that learns clean stochastic object models directly from noisy medical measurements for improved task-based image quality evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic object models for medical image quality evaluation have limitations: conventional mathematical models fail to capture realistic anatomy, while data-driven approaches require clean clinical data that is rarely available.

Method: AMID uses an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion approach with noise decoupling. It introduces a measurement-integrated strategy that aligns measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, and designs an ambient loss to learn clean stochastic object models directly from noisy measurements.

Result: Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based image quality evaluation.

Conclusion: AMID demonstrates potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis by enabling the establishment of clean stochastic object models directly from noisy clinical measurements, addressing a critical challenge in medical imaging system evaluation.

Abstract: Task-based measures of image quality (IQ) are critical for evaluating medical imaging systems, which must account for randomness including anatomical variability. Stochastic object models (SOMs) provide a statistical description of such variability, but conventional mathematical SOMs fail to capture realistic anatomy, while data-driven approaches typically require clean data rarely available in clinical tasks. To address this challenge, we propose AMID, an unsupervised Ambient Measurement-Integrated Diffusion with noise decoupling, which establishes clean SOMs directly from noisy measurements. AMID introduces a measurement-integrated strategy aligning measurement noise with the diffusion trajectory, and explicitly models coupling between measurement and diffusion noise across steps, an ambient loss is thus designed base on it to learn clean SOMs. Experiments on real CT and mammography datasets show that AMID outperforms existing methods in generation fidelity and yields more reliable task-based IQ evaluation, demonstrating its potential for unsupervised medical imaging analysis.
